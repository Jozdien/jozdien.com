Source code for my personal website, written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  And one or two Bootstrap components.

I did not write this with the intention of making it freely usable, so I advise against trying to use this for your own projects - it's very specific to my uses.  I keep it here for posterity.  If, despite that, you feel like you want to use this code, I have no problem with it.  Tell me how it goes, though.
