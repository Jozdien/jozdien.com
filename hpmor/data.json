      "Every inch of wall space is covered by a bookcase. Each bookcase\nhas six shelves, going almost to the ceiling. Some bookshelves are\nstacked to the brim with hardback books: science, maths, history,\nand everything else. Other shelves have two layers of paperback\nscience fiction, with the back layer of books propped up on old\ntissue boxes or lengths of wood, so that you can see the back layer\nof books above the books in front. And it still isn't enough. Books\nare overflowing onto the tables and the sofas and making little\nheaps under the windows.",
      "This is the living-room of the house occupied by the eminent\nProfessor Michael Verres-Evans, and his wife, Mrs. Petunia\nEvans-Verres, and their adopted son, Harry James\nPotter-Evans-Verres.",
      "There is a letter lying on the living-room table, and an\nunstamped envelope of yellowish parchment, addressed to Mr. H.\nPotter in emerald-green ink.",
      "The Professor and his wife are speaking sharply at each other,\nbut they are not shouting. The Professor considers shouting to be\nuncivilised.",
      "\"You're joking,\" Michael said to Petunia. His tone indicated\nthat he was very much afraid that she was serious.",
      "\"My sister was a witch,\" Petunia repeated. She looked\nfrightened, but stood her ground. \"Her husband was a wizard.\"",
      "\"This is absurd!\" Michael said sharply. \"They were at our\nwedding - they visited for Christmas -\"",
      "\"I told them you weren't to know,\" Petunia whispered. \"But it's\ntrue. I've seen things -\"",
      "The Professor rolled his eyes. \"Dear, I understand that you're\nnot familiar with the sceptical literature. You may not realise how\neasy it is for a trained magician to fake the seemingly impossible.\nRemember how I taught Harry to bend spoons? If it seemed like they\ncould always guess what you were thinking, that's called cold\nreading -\"",
      "\"It wasn't bending spoons -\"",
      "\"What was it, then?\"",
      "Petunia bit her lip. \"I can't just tell you. You'll think I'm -\"\nShe swallowed. \"Listen. Michael. I wasn't - always like this -\" She\ngestured at herself, as though to indicate her lithe form. \"Lily\ndid this. Because I - because I begged her. For years, I\nbegged her. Lily had always been prettier than me, and\nI'd... been mean to her, because of that, and then she got\nmagic, can you imagine how I felt? And I begged\nher to use some of that magic on me so that I could be pretty too,\neven if I couldn't have her magic, at least I could be pretty.\"",
      "Tears were gathering in Petunia's eyes.",
      "\"And Lily would tell me no, and make up the most ridiculous\nexcuses, like the world would end if she were nice to her sister,\nor a centaur told her not to - the most ridiculous things, and I\nhated her for it. And when I had just graduated from university, I\nwas going out with this boy, Vernon Dursley, he was fat and he was\nthe only boy who would talk to me. And he said he wanted children,\nand that his first son would be named Dudley. And I thought to\nmyself, what kind of parent names their child Dudley\nDursley? It was like I saw my whole future life stretching out\nin front of me, and I couldn't stand it. And I wrote to my sister\nand told her that if she didn't help me I'd rather just -\"",
      "Petunia stopped.",
      "\"Anyway,\" Petunia said, her voice small, \"she gave in. She told\nme it was dangerous, and I said I didn't care any more, and I drank\nthis potion and I was sick for weeks, but when I got better my skin\ncleared up and I finally filled out and... I was beautiful, people\nwere nice to me,\" her voice broke, \"and after that I\ncouldn't hate my sister any more, especially when I learned what\nher magic brought her in the end -\"",
      "\"Darling,\" Michael said gently, \"you got sick, you gained some\nweight while resting in bed, and your skin cleared up on its own.\nOr being sick made you change your diet -\"",
      "\"She was a witch,\" Petunia repeated. \"I saw it.\"",
      "\"Petunia,\" Michael said. The annoyance was creeping into his\nvoice. \"You know that can't be true. Do I really have to\nexplain why?\"",
      "Petunia wrung her hands. She seemed to be on the verge of tears.\n\"My love, I know I can't win arguments with you, but please, you\nhave to trust me on this -\"",
      "\"Dad! Mum!\u202f\"",
      "The two of them stopped and looked at Harry as though they'd\nforgotten there was a third person in the room.",
      "Harry took a deep breath. \"Mum, your parents didn't\nhave magic, did they?\"",
      "\"No,\" Petunia said, looking puzzled.",
      "\"Then no one in your family knew about magic when Lily got her\nletter. How did they get convinced?\"",
      "\"Ah...\" Petunia said. \"They didn't just send a letter. They sent\na professor from Hogwarts. He -\" Petunia's eyes flicked to Michael.\n\"He showed us some magic.\"",
      "\"Then you don't have to fight over this,\" Harry said firmly.\nHoping against hope that this time, just this once, they would\nlisten to him. \"If it's true, we can just get a Hogwarts professor\nhere and see the magic for ourselves, and Dad will admit that it's\ntrue. And if not, then Mum will admit that it's false. That's what\nthe experimental method is for, so that we don't have to resolve\nthings just by arguing.\"",
      "The Professor turned and looked down at him, dismissive as\nusual. \"Oh, come now, Harry. Really, magic? I thought\nyou'd know better than to take this seriously, son, even\nif you're only ten. Magic is just about the most unscientific thing\nthere is!\"",
      "Harry's mouth twisted bitterly. He was treated well, probably\nbetter than most genetic fathers treated their own children. Harry\nhad been sent to the best primary schools - and when that didn't\nwork out, he was provided with tutors from the endless pool of\nstarving students. Always Harry had been encouraged to study\nwhatever caught his attention, bought all the books that caught his\nfancy, sponsored in whatever maths or science competitions he\nentered. He was given anything reasonable that he wanted, except,\nmaybe, the slightest shred of respect. A Doctor teaching\nbiochemistry at Oxford could hardly be expected to listen to the\nadvice of a little boy. You would listen to Show Interest, of\ncourse; that's what a Good Parent would do, and so, if you\nconceived of yourself as a Good Parent, you would do it. But take a\nten-year-old seriously? Hardly.",
      "Sometimes Harry wanted to scream at his father.",
      "\"Mum,\" Harry said. \"If you want to win this argument with Dad,\nlook in chapter two of the first book of the Feynman Lectures on\nPhysics. There's a quote there about how philosophers say a great\ndeal about what science absolutely requires, and it is all wrong,\nbecause the only rule in science is that the final arbiter is\nobservation - that you just have to look at the world and report\nwhat you see. Um... off the top of my head I can't think of where\nto find something about how it's an ideal of science to settle\nthings by experiment instead of arguments -\"",
      "His mother looked down at him and smiled. \"Thank you, Harry. But\n-\" her head rose back up to stare at her husband. \"I don't want to\nwin an argument with your father. I want my husband to, to listen\nto his wife who loves him, and trust her just this once -\"",
      "Harry closed his eyes briefly. Hopeless. Both of his\nparents were just hopeless.",
      "Now his parents were getting into one of those\narguments again, one where his mother tried to make his father feel\nguilty, and his father tried to make his mother feel stupid.",
      "\"I'm going to go to my room,\" Harry announced. His voice\ntrembled a little. \"Please try not to fight too much about this,\nMum, Dad, we'll know soon enough how it comes out, right?\"",
      "\"Of course, Harry,\" said his father, and his mother gave him a\nreassuring kiss, and then they went on fighting while Harry climbed\nthe stairs to his bedroom.",
      "He shut the door behind him and tried to think.",
      "The funny thing was, he should have agreed with Dad. No\none had ever seen any evidence of magic, and according to Mum,\nthere was a whole magical world out there. How could anyone keep\nsomething like that a secret? More magic? That seemed like a rather\nsuspicious sort of excuse.",
      "It should have been a clean case for Mum joking, lying or being\ninsane, in ascending order of awfulness. If Mum had sent the letter\nherself, that would explain how it arrived at the letterbox without\na stamp. A little insanity was far, far less improbable than the\nuniverse really working like that.",
      "Except that some part of Harry was utterly convinced that magic\nwas real, and had been since the instant he saw the putative letter\nfrom the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.",
      "Harry rubbed his forehead, grimacing. Don't believe\neverything you think, one of his books had said.",
      "But this bizarre certainty... Harry was finding himself just\nexpecting that, yes, a Hogwarts professor would show up\nand wave a wand and magic would come out. The strange certainty was\nmaking no effort to guard itself against falsification - wasn't\nmaking excuses in advance for why there wouldn't be a professor, or\nthe professor would only be able to bend spoons.",
      "Where do you come from, strange little prediction?\nHarry directed the thought at his brain. Why do I believe what\nI believe?",
      "Usually Harry was pretty good at answering that question, but in\nthis particular case, he had no clue what his brain was\nthinking.",
      "Harry mentally shrugged. A flat metal plate on a door affords\npushing, and a handle on a door affords pulling, and the thing to\ndo with a testable hypothesis is to go and test it.",
      "He took a piece of lined paper from his desk, and started\nwriting.",
      "Dear Deputy Headmistress",
      "Harry paused, reflecting; then discarded the paper for another,\ntapping another millimetre of graphite from his mechanical pencil.\nThis called for careful calligraphy.",
      "Dear Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall,",
      "Or Whomsoever It May Concern:",
      "I recently received your letter of acceptance to Hogwarts,\naddressed to Mr. H. Potter. You may not be aware that my genetic\nparents, James Potter and Lily Potter (formerly Lily Evans) are\ndead. I was adopted by Lily's sister, Petunia Evans-Verres, and her\nhusband, Michael Verres-Evans.",
      "I am extremely interested in attending Hogwarts, conditional\non such a place actually existing. Only my mother Petunia says she\nknows about magic, and she can't use it herself. My father is\nhighly sceptical. I myself am uncertain. I also don't know where to\nobtain any of the books or equipment listed in your acceptance\nletter.",
      "Mother mentioned that you sent a Hogwarts representative to\nLily Potter (then Lily Evans) in order to demonstrate to her family\nthat magic was real, and, I presume, help Lily obtain her school\nmaterials. If you could do this for my own family it would be\nextremely helpful.",
      "Sincerely,",
      "Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres.",
      "Harry added their current address, then folded up the letter and\nput it in an envelope, which he addressed to Hogwarts. Further\nconsideration led him to obtain a candle and drip wax onto the flap\nof the envelope, into which, using a penknife's tip, he impressed\nthe initials H.J.P.E.V. If he was going to descend into this\nmadness, he was going to do it with style.",
      "Then he opened his door and went back downstairs. His father was\nsitting in the living-room and reading a book of higher maths to\nshow how smart he was; and his mother was in the kitchen preparing\none of his father's favourite meals to show how loving she was. It\ndidn't look like they were talking to one another at all. As scary\nas arguments could be, not arguing was somehow much\nworse.",
      "\"Mum,\" Harry said into the unnerving silence, \"I'm going to test\nthe hypothesis. According to your theory, how do I send an owl to\nHogwarts?\"",
      "His mother turned from the kitchen sink to stare at him, looking\nshocked. \"I - I don't know, I think you just have to own a magic\nowl.\"",
      "That should've sounded highly suspicious, oh, so there's no\nway to test your theory then, but the peculiar certainty in\nHarry seemed willing to stick its neck out even further.",
      "\"Well, the letter got here somehow,\" Harry said, \"so I'll just\nwave it around outside and call 'letter for Hogwarts!' and see if\nan owl picks it up. Dad, do you want to come and watch?\"",
      "His father shook his head minutely and kept on reading. Of\ncourse, Harry thought to himself. Magic was a disgraceful\nthing that only stupid people believed in; if his father went so\nfar as to test the hypothesis, or even watch it\nbeing tested, that would feel like associating himself\nwith that...",
      "Only as Harry stumped out the back door, into the back garden,\ndid it occur to him that if an owl did come down and\nsnatch the letter, he was going to have some trouble telling Dad\nabout it.",
      "But - well - that can't really happen, can it? No\nmatter what my brain seems to believe. If an owl really comes down\nand grabs this envelope, I'm going to have worries a lot more\nimportant than what Dad thinks.",
      "Harry took a deep breath, and raised the envelope into the\nair.",
      "He swallowed.",
      "Calling out Letter for Hogwarts! while holding an\nenvelope high in the air in the middle of your own back garden\nwas... actually pretty embarrassing, now that he thought about\nit.",
      "No. I'm better than Dad. I will use the scientific method\neven if it makes me feel stupid.",
      "\"Letter -\" Harry said, but it actually came out as more of a\nwhispered croak.",
      "Harry steeled his will, and shouted into the empty sky,\n\"Letter for Hogwarts! Can I get an owl?\u202f\"",
      "\"Harry?\" asked a bemused woman's voice, one of the\nneighbours.",
      "Harry pulled down his hand like it was on fire and hid the\nenvelope behind his back like it was drug money. His whole face was\nhot with shame.",
      "An old woman's face peered out from above the neighbouring\nfence, grizzled grey hair escaping from her hairnet. Mrs. Figg, the\noccasional babysitter. \"What are you doing, Harry?\"",
      "\"Nothing,\" Harry said in a strangled voice. \"Just - testing a\nreally silly theory -\"",
      "\"Did you get your acceptance letter from Hogwarts?\"",
      "Harry froze in place.",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry's lips said a little while later. \"I got a letter\nfrom Hogwarts. They say they want my owl by the 31st of July, but\n-\"",
      "\"But you don't have an owl. Poor dear! I can't imagine\nwhat someone must have been thinking, sending you just the\nstandard letter.\"",
      "A wrinkled arm stretched out over the fence, and opened an\nexpectant hand. Hardly even thinking at this point, Harry gave over\nhis envelope.",
      "\"Just leave it to me, dear,\" said Mrs. Figg, \"and in a jiffy or\ntwo I'll have someone over.\"",
      "And her face disappeared from over the fence.",
      "There was a long silence in the garden.",
      "Then a boy's voice said, calmly and quietly, \"What.\""

      "\"Of course it was my fault. There's no one else here who\ncould be responsible for anything.\"",
      "\"Now, just to be clear,\" Harry said, \"if the professor does\nlevitate you, Dad, when you know you haven't been attached to any\nwires, that's going to be sufficient evidence. You're not going to\nturn around and say that it's a magician's trick. That wouldn't be\nfair play. If you feel that way, you should say so now,\nand we can figure out a different experiment instead.\"",
      "Harry's father, Professor Michael Verres-Evans, rolled his eyes.\n\"Yes, Harry.\"",
      "\"And you, Mum, your theory says that the professor should be\nable to do this, and if that doesn't happen, you'll admit you're\nmistaken. Nothing about how magic doesn't work when people are\nsceptical of it, or anything like that.\"",
      "Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall was watching Harry with a\nbemused expression. She looked quite witchy in her black robes and\npointed hat, but when she spoke she sounded formal and Scottish,\nwhich didn't go together with the look at all. At first glance she\nlooked like someone who ought to cackle and put babies into\ncauldrons, but the whole effect was ruined as soon as she opened\nher mouth. \"Is that sufficient, Mr. Potter?\" she said. \"Shall I go\nahead and demonstrate?\"",
      "\"Sufficient? Probably not,\" Harry said. \"But at least\nit will help. Go ahead, Deputy Headmistress.\"",
      "\"Just Professor will do,\" said she, and then, \"Wingardium\nLeviosa.\"",
      "Harry looked at his father.",
      "\"Huh,\" Harry said.",
      "His father looked back at him. \"Huh,\" his father echoed.",
      "Then Professor Verres-Evans looked back at Professor McGonagall.\n\"All right, you can put me down now.\"",
      "His father was lowered carefully to the ground.",
      "Harry ruffled a hand through his own hair. Maybe it was just\nthat strange part of him which had already been convinced,\nbut... \"That's a bit of an anticlimax,\" Harry said. \"You'd think\nthere'd be some kind of more dramatic mental event associated with\nupdating on an observation of infinitesimal probability -\" Harry\nstopped himself. Mum, the witch, and even his Dad were giving him\nthat look again. \"I mean, with finding out that everything\nI believe is false.\"",
      "Seriously, it should have been more dramatic. His brain ought to\nhave been flushing its entire current stock of hypotheses about the\nuniverse, none of which allowed this to happen. But instead his\nbrain just seemed to be going, All right, I saw the Hogwarts\nProfessor wave her wand and make your father rise into the air, now\nwhat?",
      "The witch-lady was smiling benevolently upon them, looking quite\namused. \"Would you like a further demonstration, Mr. Potter?\"",
      "\"You don't have to,\" Harry said. \"We've performed a definitive\nexperiment. But...\" Harry hesitated. He couldn't help himself.\nActually, under the circumstances, he shouldn't be helping\nhimself. It was right and proper to be curious. \"What else\ncan you do?\"",
      "Professor McGonagall turned into a cat.",
      "Harry scrambled back unthinkingly, backpedalling so fast that he\ntripped over a stray stack of books and landed hard on his bottom\nwith a thwack. His hands came down to catch himself\nwithout quite reaching properly, and there was a warning twinge in\nhis shoulder as the weight came down unbraced.",
      "At once the small tabby cat morphed back up into a robed woman.\n\"I'm sorry, Mr. Potter,\" said the witch, sounding sincere, though\nthe corners of her lips were twitching upwards. \"I should have\nwarned you.\"",
      "Harry was breathing in short gasps. His voice came out choked.\n\"You can't DO that!\"",
      "\"It's only a Transfiguration,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"An\nAnimagus transformation, to be exact.\"",
      "\"You turned into a cat! A SMALL cat! You violated\nConservation of Energy! That's not just an arbitrary rule, it's\nimplied by the form of the quantum Hamiltonian! Rejecting it\ndestroys unitarity and then you get FTL signalling! And cats are\nCOMPLICATED! A human mind can't just visualise a whole\ncat's anatomy and, and all the cat biochemistry, and what about the\nneurology? How can you go on thinking using a\ncat-sized brain?\"",
      "Professor McGonagall's lips were twitching harder now.\n\"Magic.\"",
      "\"Magic isn't enough to do that! You'd have to be a\ngod!\"",
      "Professor McGonagall blinked. \"That's the first time I've ever\nbeen called that.\"",
      "A blur was coming over Harry's vision, as his brain started to\ncomprehend what had just broken. The whole idea of a unified\nuniverse with mathematically regular laws, that was what had been\nflushed down the toilet; the whole notion of physics.\nThree thousand years of resolving big complicated things into\nsmaller pieces, discovering that the music of the planets was the\nsame tune as a falling apple, finding that the true laws were\nperfectly universal and had no exceptions anywhere and took the\nform of simple maths governing the smallest parts, not to\nmention that the mind was the brain and the brain was made of\nneurons, a brain was what a person was -",
      "And then a woman turned into a cat, so much for all that.",
      "A hundred questions fought for priority over Harry's lips and\nthe winner poured out: \"And, and what kind of incantation is\nWingardium Leviosa? Who invents the words to these spells,\nnursery schoolers?\"",
      "\"That will do, Mr. Potter,\" Professor McGonagall said crisply,\nthough her eyes shone with suppressed amusement. \"If you wish to\nlearn about magic, I suggest that we finalise the paperwork so that\nyou can go to Hogwarts.\"",
      "\"Right,\" Harry said, somewhat dazed. He pulled his thoughts\ntogether. The March of Reason would just have to start over, that\nwas all; they still had the experimental method and that was the\nimportant thing. \"How do I get to Hogwarts, then?\"",
      "A choked laugh escaped Professor McGonagall, as if extracted\nfrom her by tweezers.",
      "\"Hold on a moment, Harry,\" his father said. \"Remember why you\nhaven't been going to school up until now? What about your\ncondition?\"",
      "Professor McGonagall spun to face Michael. \"His condition?\nWhat's this?\"",
      "\"I don't sleep right,\" Harry said. He waved his hands\nhelplessly. \"My sleep cycle is twenty-six hours long, I always go\nto sleep two hours later, every day. I can't fall asleep any\nearlier than that, and then the next day I go to sleep two hours\nlater than that. 10PM, 12AM, 2AM, 4AM, until it goes\naround the clock. Even if I try to wake up early, it makes no\ndifference and I'm a wreck that whole day. That's why I haven't\nbeen going to a normal school up until now.\"",
      "\"One of the reasons,\" said his mother. Harry shot her a\nglare.",
      "McGonagall gave a long hmmmmm. \"I can't recall hearing\nabout such a condition before...\" she said slowly. \"I'll check with\nMadam Pomfrey to see if she knows any remedies.\" Then her face\nbrightened. \"No, I'm sure this won't be a problem - I'll find a\nsolution in time. Now,\" and her gaze sharpened again, \"what are\nthese other reasons?\"",
      "Harry sent his parents a glare. \"I am a conscientious objector\nto child conscription, on grounds that I should not have to suffer\nfor a disintegrating school system's failure to provide teachers or\nstudy materials of even minimally adequate quality.\"",
      "Both of Harry's parents howled with laughter at that, like they\nthought it was all a big joke. \"Oh,\" said Harry's father, eyes\nbright, \"is that why you bit a maths teacher in third\nyear.\"",
      "\"She didn't know what a logarithm was!\u202f\"",
      "\"Of course,\" seconded Harry's mother. \"Biting her was a very\nmature response to that.\"",
      "Harry's father nodded. \"A well-considered policy for addressing\nthe problem of teachers who don't understand logarithms.\"",
      "\"I was seven years old! How long are you going to keep\non bringing that up?\"",
      "\"I know,\" said his mother sympathetically, \"you bite\none maths teacher and they never let you forget it, do\nthey?\"",
      "Harry turned to Professor McGonagall. \"There! You see what I\nhave to deal with?\"",
      "\"Excuse me,\" said Petunia, and fled through the backdoor into\nthe garden, from which her screams of laughter were clearly\naudible.",
      "\"There, ah, there,\" Professor McGonagall seemed to be having\ntrouble speaking for some reason, \"there is to be no biting of\nteachers at Hogwarts, is that quite clear, Mr. Potter?\"",
      "Harry scowled at her. \"Fine, I won't bite anyone who doesn't\nbite me first.\"",
      "Professor Michael Verres-Evans also had to leave the room\nbriefly upon hearing that.",
      "\"Well,\" Professor McGonagall sighed, after Harry's parents had\ncomposed themselves and returned. \"Well. I think, under the\ncircumstances, that I should avoid taking you to purchase your\nstudy materials until a day or two before school begins.\"",
      "\"What? Why? The other children already know magic, don't they? I\nhave to start catching up right away!\"",
      "\"Rest assured, Mr. Potter,\" replied Professor McGonagall,\n\"Hogwarts is quite capable of teaching the basics. And I suspect,\nMr. Potter, that if I leave you alone for two months with your\nschoolbooks, even without a wand, I will return to this house only\nto find a crater billowing purple smoke, a depopulated city\nsurrounding it and a plague of flaming zebras terrorising what\nremains of England.\"",
      "Harry's mother and father nodded in perfect unison.",

      "If J. K. Rowling asks you about this story, you know\nnothing.",
      "\"But then the question is - who?\"",
      "\"Good Lord,\" said the barman, peering at Harry, \"is this - can\nthis be -?\"",
      "Harry leaned towards the bar of the Leaky Cauldron as best he\ncould, though it came up to somewhere around the tips of his\neyebrows. A question like that deserved his very best.",
      "\"Am I - could I be - maybe - you never know - if I'm\nnot - but then the question is - who?\u202f\"",
      "\"Bless my soul,\" whispered the old barman. \"Harry Potter... what\nan honour.\"",
      "Harry blinked, then rallied. \"Well, yes, you're quite\nperceptive; most people don't realise that so quickly -\"",
      "\"That's enough,\" Professor McGonagall said. Her hand tightened\non Harry's shoulder. \"Don't pester the boy, Tom, he's new to all\nthis.\"",
      "\"But it is him?\" quavered an old woman. \"It's Harry Potter?\"\nWith a scraping sound, she got up from her chair.",
      "\"Doris -\" McGonagall said warningly. The glare she shot around\nthe room should have been enough to intimidate anyone.",
      "\"I only want to shake his hand,\" the woman whispered. She bent\nlow and stuck out a wrinkled hand, which Harry, feeling confused\nand more uncomfortable than he ever had in his life, carefully\nshook. Tears fell from the woman's eyes onto their clasped hands.\n\"My granson was an Auror,\" she whispered to him. \"Died in\nseventy-nine. Thank you, Harry Potter. Thank heavens for you.\"",
      "\"You're welcome,\" Harry said automatically, and then he turned\nhis head and shot Professor McGonagall a frightened, pleading\nlook.",
      "Professor McGonagall slammed her foot down just as the general\nrush was about to start. It made a noise that gave Harry a new\nreferent for the phrase \"Crack of Doom\", and everyone froze in\nplace.",
      "\"We're in a hurry,\" Professor McGonagall said in a voice that\nsounded perfectly, utterly normal.",
      "They left the bar without any trouble.",
      "\"Professor?\" Harry said, once they were in the courtyard. He had\nmeant to ask what was going on, but oddly found himself asking an\nentirely different question instead. \"Who was that pale man, by the\ncorner? The man with the twitching eye?\"",
      "\"Hm?\" said Professor McGonagall, sounding a bit surprised;\nperhaps she hadn't expected that question either. \"That was\nProfessor Quirinus Quirrell. He'll be teaching Defence Against the\nDark Arts this year at Hogwarts.\"",
      "\"I had the strangest feeling that I knew him...\" Harry rubbed\nhis forehead. \"And that I shouldn't ought to shake his hand.\" Like\nmeeting someone who had been a friend, once, before something went\ndrastically wrong... that wasn't really it at all, but Harry\ncouldn't find words. \"And what was... all of that?\"",
      "Professor McGonagall was giving him an odd glance. \"Mr.\nPotter... do you know... how much have you been told...\nabout how your parents died?\"",
      "Harry returned a steady look. \"My parents are alive and well,\nand they always refused to talk about how my genetic\nparents died. From which I infer that it wasn't good.\"",
      "\"An admirable loyalty,\" said Professor McGonagall. Her voice\nwent low. \"Though it hurts a little to hear you say it like that.\nLily and James were friends of mine.\"",
      "Harry looked away, suddenly ashamed. \"I'm sorry,\" he said in a\nsmall voice. \"But I have a Mum and Dad. And I know that\nI'd just make myself unhappy by comparing that reality to...\nsomething perfect that I built up in my imagination.\"",
      "\"That is amazingly wise of you,\" Professor McGonagall said\nquietly. \"But your genetic parents died very well indeed,\nprotecting you.\"",
      "Protecting me?",
      "Something strange clutched at Harry's heart. \"What...\ndid happen?\"",
      "Professor McGonagall sighed. Her wand tapped Harry's forehead,\nand his vision blurred for a moment. \"Something of a disguise,\" she\nsaid, \"so that this doesn't happen again, not until you're ready.\"\nThen her wand licked out again, and tapped three times on a brick\nwall...",
      "...which hollowed into a hole, and dilated and expanded and\nshivered into a huge archway, revealing a long row of shops with\nsigns advertising cauldrons and dragon livers.",
      "Harry didn't blink. It wasn't like anyone was turning into a\ncat.",
      "And they walked forwards, together, into the wizarding\nworld.",
      "There were merchants hawking Bounce Boots (\"Made with real\nFlubber!\") and \"Knives +3! Forks +2! Spoons with a +4 bonus!\" There\nwere goggles that would turn anything you looked at green, and a\nlineup of comfy armchairs with ejection seats for emergencies.",
      "Harry's head kept rotating, rotating like it was trying to wind\nitself off his neck. It was like walking through the magical items\nsection of an Advanced Dungeons and Dragons rulebook (he\ndidn't play the game, but he did enjoy reading the rulebooks).\nHarry desperately didn't want to miss a single item for sale, in\ncase it was one of the three you needed to complete the cycle of\ninfinite wish spells.",
      "Then Harry spotted something that made him, entirely without\nthinking, veer off from the Deputy Headmistress and start heading\nstraight into the shop, a front of blue bricks with bronze-metal\ntrim. He was brought back to reality only when Professor McGonagall\nstepped right in front of him.",
      "\"Mr. Potter?\" she said.",
      "Harry blinked, then realised what he'd just done. \"I'm sorry! I\nforgot for a moment that I was with you instead of my family.\"\nHarry gestured at the shop window, which displayed fiery letters\nthat shone piercingly bright and yet remote, spelling out\nBigbam's Brilliant Books. \"When you walk past a bookshop\nyou haven't visited before, you have to go in and look around.\nThat's the family rule.\"",
      "\"That is the most Ravenclaw thing I have ever heard.\"",
      "\"What?\"",
      "\"Nothing. Mr. Potter, our first step is to visit Gringotts, the\nbank of the wizarding world. Your genetic family vault is\nthere, with the inheritance your genetic parents left you,\nand you'll need money for school supplies.\" She sighed. \"And, I\nsuppose, a certain amount of spending money for books could be\nexcused as well. Though you might want to hold off for a time.\nHogwarts has quite a large library on magical subjects. And the\ntower in which, I strongly suspect, you will be living, has a more\nbroad-ranging library of its own. Any book you bought now would\nprobably be a duplicate.\"",
      "Harry nodded, and they walked on.",
      "\"Don't get me wrong, it's a great distraction,\" Harry\nsaid as his head kept swivelling, \"probably the best distraction\nanyone has ever tried on me, but don't think I've forgotten about\nour pending discussion.\"",
      "Professor McGonagall sighed. \"Your parents - or your mother at\nany rate - may have been very wise not to tell you.\"",
      "\"So you wish that I could continue in blissful ignorance? There\nis a certain flaw in that plan, Professor McGonagall.\"",
      "\"I suppose it would be rather pointless,\" the witch said\ntightly, \"when anyone on the street could tell you the story. Very\nwell.\"",
      "And she told him of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, the Dark Lord,\nVoldemort.",
      "\"Voldemort?\" Harry whispered. It should have been funny, but it\nwasn't. The name burned with a cold feeling, ruthlessness, diamond\nclarity, a hammer of pure titanium descending upon an anvil of\nyielding flesh. A chill swept over Harry even as he pronounced the\nword, and he resolved then and there to use safer terms like\nYou-Know-Who.",
      "The Dark Lord had raged upon wizarding Britain like a wilding\nwolf, tearing and rending at the fabric of their everyday lives.\nOther countries had wrung their hands but hesitated to intervene,\nwhether out of apathetic selfishness or simple fear, for whichever\nwas first among them to oppose the Dark Lord, their peace would be\nthe next target of his terror.",
      "(The bystander effect, thought Harry, thinking of\nLatane and Darley's experiment which had shown that you were more\nlikely to get help if you had an epileptic fit in front of one\nperson than in front of three. Diffusion of responsibility,\neveryone hoping that someone else would go first.)",
      "The Death Eaters had followed in the Dark Lord's wake and in his\nvanguard, carrion vultures to pick at wounds, or snakes to bite and\nweaken. The Death Eaters were not as terrible as the Dark Lord, but\nthey were terrible, and they were many. And the Death Eaters\nwielded more than wands; there was wealth within those masked\nranks, and political power, and secrets held in blackmail, to\nparalyse a society trying to protect itself.",
      "An old and respected journalist, Yermy Wibble, called for\nincreased taxes and conscription. He shouted that it was absurd for\nthe many to cower in fear of the few. His skin, only his skin, had\nbeen found nailed to the newsroom wall that next morning, next to\nthe skins of his wife and two daughters. Everyone wished for\nsomething more to be done, and no one dared take the lead to\npropose it. Whoever stood out the most became the next example.",
      "Until the names of James and Lily Potter rose to the top of that\nlist.",
      "And those two might have died with their wands in their hands\nand not regretted their choices, for they were heroes; but\nfor that they had an infant child, their son, Harry Potter.",
      "Tears were coming into Harry's eyes. He wiped them away in anger\nor maybe desperation, I didn't know those people, not really,\nthey aren't my parents now, it would be pointless to feel\nso sad for them -",
      "When Harry was done sobbing into the witch's robes, he looked\nup, and felt a little bit better to see tears in Professor\nMcGonagall's eyes as well.",
      "\"So what happened?\" Harry said, his voice trembling.",
      "\"The Dark Lord came to Godric's Hollow,\" Professor McGonagall\nsaid in a whisper. \"You should have been hidden, but you were\nbetrayed. The Dark Lord killed James, and he killed Lily, and he\ncame in the end to you, to your cot. He cast the Killing Curse at\nyou, and that was where it ended. The Killing Curse is formed of\npure hate, and strikes directly at the soul, severing it from the\nbody. It cannot be blocked, and whomever it strikes, they die. But\nyou survived. You are the only person ever to survive. The Killing\nCurse rebounded and struck the Dark Lord, leaving only the burnt\nhulk of his body and a scar upon your forehead. That was the end of\nthe terror, and we were free. That, Harry Potter, is why people\nwant to see the scar on your forehead, and why they want to shake\nyour hand.\"",
      "The storm of weeping that had washed through Harry had used up\nall his tears; he could not cry again, he was done.",
      "(And somewhere in the back of his mind was a small, small note\nof confusion, a sense of something wrong about that story; and it\nshould have been a part of Harry's art to notice that tiny note,\nbut he was distracted. For it is a sad rule that whenever you are\nmost in need of your art as a rationalist, that is when you are\nmost likely to forget it.)",
      "Harry detached himself from Professor McGonagall's side. \"I'll -\nhave to think about this,\" he said, trying to keep his voice under\ncontrol. He stared at his shoes. \"Um. You can go ahead and call\nthem my parents, if you want, you don't have to say 'genetic\nparents' or anything. I guess there's no reason I can't have two\nmothers and two fathers.\"",
      "There was no sound from Professor McGonagall.",
      "And they walked together in silence, until they came before a\ngreat white building with vast bronze doors, and carven words above\nsaying Gringotts Bank."

      "Disclaimer: J. K. Rowling is watching you from where she waits,\neternally in the void between worlds.",
      "A/N: As others have noted, the novels seem inconsistent in the\napparent purchasing power of a Galleon; I'm picking a consistent\nvalue and sticking with it. Five pounds sterling to the Galleon\ndoesn't square with seven Galleons for a wand and children using\nhand-me-down wands.",
      "\"World domination is such an ugly phrase. I prefer to call\nit world optimisation.\"",
      "Heaps of gold Galleons. Stacks of silver Sickles. Piles of\nbronze Knuts.",
      "Harry stood there, and stared with his mouth open at the family\nvault. He had so many questions he didn't know where to\nstart.",
      "From just outside the door of the vault, Professor McGonagall\nwatched him, seeming to lean casually against the wall, but her\neyes intent. Well, that made sense. Being plopped in front of a\ngiant heap of gold coins was a test of character so pure it was\narchetypal.",
      "\"Are these coins the pure metal?\" Harry said finally.",
      "\"What?\" hissed the goblin Griphook, who was waiting near the\ndoor. \"Are you questioning the integrity of Gringotts, Mr.\nPotter-Evans-Verres?\"",
      "\"No,\" said Harry absently, \"not at all, sorry if that came out\nwrong, sir. I just have no idea at all how your financial system\nworks. I'm asking if Galleons in general are made of pure\ngold.\"",
      "\"Of course,\" said Griphook.",
      "\"And can anyone coin them, or are they issued by a monopoly that\nthereby collects seigniorage?\"",
      "\"What?\" said Professor McGonagall.",
      "Griphook grinned, showing sharp teeth. \"Only a fool would trust\nany but goblin coin!\"",
      "\"In other words,\" Harry said, \"the coins aren't supposed to be\nworth any more than the metal making them up?\"",
      "Griphook stared at Harry. Professor McGonagall looked\nbemused.",
      "\"I mean, suppose I came in here with a ton of silver. Could I\nget a ton of Sickles made from it?\"",
      "\"For a fee, Mr. Potter-Evans-Verres.\" The goblin watched him\nwith glittering eyes. \"For a certain fee. Where would you find a\nton of silver, I wonder?\"",
      "\"I was speaking hypothetically,\" Harry said. For now, at any\nrate. \"So... how much would you charge in fees, as a fraction\nof the whole weight?\"",
      "Griphook's eyes were intent. \"I would have to consult my\nsuperiors...\"",
      "\"Give me a wild guess. I won't hold Gringotts to it.\"",
      "\"A twentieth part of the metal would well pay for the\ncoining.\"",
      "Harry nodded. \"Thank you very much, Mr. Griphook.\"",
      "So not only is the wizarding economy almost completely\ndecoupled from the Muggle economy, no one here has ever heard of\narbitrage. The larger Muggle economy had a fluctuating trading\nrange of gold to silver, so every time the Muggle gold-to-silver\nratio got more than 5% away from the weight of seventeen Sickles to\none Galleon, either gold or silver should have drained from the\nwizarding economy until it became impossible to maintain the\nexchange rate. Bring in a ton of silver, change to Sickles (and pay\n5%), change the Sickles for Galleons, take the gold to the Muggle\nworld, exchange it for more silver than you started with, and\nrepeat.",
      "Wasn't the Muggle gold to silver ratio somewhere around fifty to\none? Harry didn't think it was seventeen, anyway. And it looked\nlike the silver coins were actually smaller than the gold\ncoins.",
      "Then again, Harry was standing in a bank that literally\nstored your money in vaults full of gold coins guarded by dragons,\nwhere you had to go in and take coins out of your vault whenever\nyou wanted to spend money. The finer points of arbitraging away\nmarket inefficiencies might well be lost on them. He'd been tempted\nto make snide remarks about the crudity of their financial\nsystem...",
      "But the sad thing is, their way is probably better.",
      "On the other hand, one competent hedge fundie could probably own\nthe whole wizarding world within a week. Harry filed away this\nnotion in case he ever ran out of money, or had a week free.",
      "Meanwhile, the giant heaps of gold coins within the Potter vault\nought to suit his near-term requirements.",
      "Harry stumped forward, and began picking up gold coins with one\nhand and dumping them into the other.",
      "When he had reached twenty, Professor McGonagall coughed. \"I\nthink that will be more than enough to pay for your school\nsupplies, Mr. Potter.\"",
      "\"Hm?\" Harry said, his mind elsewhere. \"Hold on, I'm doing a\nFermi calculation.\"",
      "\"A what?\u202f\" said Professor McGonagall, sounding somewhat\nalarmed.",
      "\"It's a mathematical thing. Named after Enrico Fermi. A way of\ngetting rough numbers quickly in your head...\"",
      "Twenty gold Galleons weighed a tenth of a kilogram, maybe? And\ngold was, what, ten thousand British pounds a kilogram? So a\nGalleon would be worth about fifty pounds... The mounds of gold\ncoins looked to be about sixty coins high and twenty coins wide in\neither dimension of the base, and a mound was pyramidal, so it\nwould be around one-third of the cube. Eight thousand Galleons per\nmound, roughly, and there were around five mounds of that size, so\nforty thousand Galleons or 2 million pounds sterling.",
      "Not bad. Harry smiled with a certain grim satisfaction. It was\ntoo bad that he was right in the middle of discovering the amazing\nnew world of magic, and couldn't take time out to explore the\namazing new world of being rich, which a quick Fermi estimate said\nwas roughly a billion times less interesting.",
      "Still, that's the last time I ever mow a lawn for one lousy\npound.",
      "Harry wheeled from the giant heap of money. \"Pardon me for\nasking, Professor McGonagall, but I understand that my parents were\nin their twenties when they died. Is this a usual amount\nof money for a young couple to have in their vault, in the\nwizarding world?\" If it was, a cup of tea probably cost five\nthousand pounds. Rule one of economics: you can't eat money.",
      "Professor McGonagall shook her head. \"Your father was the last\nheir of an old family, Mr. Potter. It's also possible...\" The witch\nhesitated. \"Some of this money may be from bounties placed on\nYou-Know-Who, payable to his ki- ah, to whoever might defeat him.\nOr those bounties might not have been collected yet. I am not\nsure.\"",
      "\"Interesting...\" Harry said slowly. \"So some of this really is,\nin a sense, mine. That is, earned by me. Sort of. Possibly. Even if\nI don't remember the occasion.\" Harry's fingers tapped against his\ntrouser-leg. \"That makes me feel less guilty about spending a\nvery tiny fraction of it! Don't panic, Professor\nMcGonagall!\u202f\"",
      "\"Mr. Potter! You are a minor, and as such, you will only be\nallowed to make reasonable withdrawals from -\"",
      "\"I am all about reasonable! I am totally on board with\nfiscal prudence and impulse control! But I did see some\nthings on the way here which would constitute sensible,\ngrown-up purchases...\"",
      "Harry locked gazes with Professor McGonagall, engaging in a\nsilent staring contest.",
      "\"Like what?\" Professor McGonagall said finally.",
      "\"Trunks whose insides hold more than their outsides?\"",
      "Professor McGonagall's face grew stern. \"Those are very\nexpensive, Mr. Potter!\"",
      "\"Yes, but -\" Harry pleaded. \"I'm sure that when I'm an adult\nI'll want one. And I can afford one. Logically, it would\nmake just as much sense to buy it now instead of later, and get the\nuse of it right away. It's the same money either way, right? I\nmean, I would want a good one, with lots of room\ninside, good enough that I wouldn't have to just get a better one\nlater...\" Harry trailed off hopefully.",
      "Professor McGonagall's gaze didn't waver. \"And just what would\nyou keep in a trunk like that, Mr. Potter -\"",
      "\"Books.\"",
      "\"Of course,\" sighed Professor McGonagall.",
      "\"You should have told me much earlier that sort of\nmagic item existed! And that I could afford one! Now my father and\nI are going to have to spend the next two days frantically\nhitting up all the secondhand bookshops for old textbooks, so I can\nhave a decent science library with me at Hogwarts - and maybe a\nsmall science fiction collection, if I can assemble something\ndecent out of the bargain bins. Or better yet, I'll make the deal a\nlittle sweeter for you, okay? Just let me buy -\"",
      "\"Mr. Potter! You think you can bribe me?\"",
      "\"What? No! Not like that! I'm saying, Hogwarts can keep\nsome of the books I bring, if you think that any of them would make\ngood additions to the library. I'm going to be getting them cheap,\nand I just want to have them around somewhere or other.\nIt's okay to bribe people with books, right? That's a\n-\"",
      "\"Family tradition.\"",
      "\"Yes, exactly.\"",
      "Professor McGonagall's body seemed to slump, the shoulders\nlowering within her black robes. \"I cannot deny the sense of your\nwords, though I much wish I could. I will allow you to withdraw an\nadditional hundred Galleons, Mr. Potter.\" She sighed again. \"I\nknow that I shall regret this, and I am doing it\nanyway.\"",
      "\"That's the spirit! And does a 'mokeskin pouch' do what I think\nit does?\"",
      "\"It can't do as much as a trunk,\" the witch said with visible\nreluctance, \"but... a mokeskin pouch with a Retrieval Charm and\nUndetectable Extension Charm can hold a number of items until they\nare called forth by the one who emplaced them -\"",
      "\"Yes! I definitely need one of those too! It would be like the\nsuper beltpack of ultimate awesomeness! Batman's utility belt of\nholding! Never mind my swiss army knife, I could carry a whole tool\nset in there! Or books! I could have the top three books I\nwas reading on me at all times, and just pull one out anywhere!\nI'll never have to waste another minute of my life! What do you\nsay, Professor McGonagall? It's for the sake of children's reading,\nthe best of all possible causes.\"",
      "\"...I suppose you may add another ten Galleons.\"",
      "Griphook was favouring Harry with a gaze of frank respect,\npossibly even outright admiration.",
      "\"And a little spending money, like you mentioned earlier. I\nthink I can remember seeing one or two other things I might want to\nstore in that pouch.\"",
      "\"Don't push it, Mr. Potter.\"",
      "\"But oh, Professor McGonagall, why rain on my parade? Surely\nthis is a happy day, when I discover all things wizarding\nfor the first time! Why act the part of the grumpy grownup when\ninstead you could smile and remember your own innocent childhood,\nwatching the look of delight upon my young face as I buy a few toys\nusing an insignificant fraction of the wealth that I earned by\ndefeating the most terrible wizard Britain has ever known, not that\nI'm accusing you of being ungrateful or anything, but still, what\nare a few toys compared to that?\"",
      "\"You,\" growled Professor McGonagall. There was a look\non her face so fearsome and terrible that Harry squeaked and\nstepped back, knocking over a pile of gold coins with a great\njingling noise and sprawling backwards into a heap of money.\nGriphook sighed and put a palm over his face. \"I would be doing a\ngreat service to wizarding Britain, Mr. Potter, if I locked you in\nthis vault and left you here.\"",
      "And they left without any more trouble."

      "\"It would've required a supernatural intervention\nfor him to have your morality given his\nenvironment.\"",
      "The Moke Shop was a quaint little shop (some might even say\ncute) ensconced behind a vegetable stall that was behind a magical\nglove shop that was on an alleyway off a side street of Diagon\nAlley. Disappointingly, the shopkeeper was not a wizened ancient\ncrone; just a nervous-looking young woman wearing faded yellow\nrobes. Right now she was holding out a Moke Super Pouch QX31, whose\nselling point was that it had a Widening Lip as well as an\nUndetectable Extension Charm: you could actually fit big things in\nit, though the total volume was still limited.",
      "Harry had insisted on coming here straight away, first\nthing - insisted as hard as he thought he could without making\nProfessor McGonagall suspicious. Harry had something he needed to\nput into the pouch as soon as possible. It wasn't the bag of\nGalleons that Professor McGonagall had allowed him to withdraw from\nGringotts. It was all the other Galleons that Harry had\nsurreptitiously shoved into his pocket after falling into a heap of\ngold coins. That had been a real accident, but Harry was\nnever one to discard an opportunity... though it'd really been more\nof a spur-of-the-moment thing. Ever since Harry had been awkwardly\ncarrying the allowed bag of Galleons next to his trouser pocket, so\nthat any jingling would seem to come from the right place.",
      "This still left the question of how he was actually going to get\nthe other coins into the pouch without getting caught. The\ngolden coins might have been his, but they were still stolen -\nself-stolen? Auto-thieved?",
      "Harry looked up from the Moke Super Pouch QX31 on the counter in\nfront of him. \"Can I try this for a bit? To make sure it works, um,\nreliably?\" He widened his eyes in an expression of boyish, playful\ninnocence.",
      "Sure enough, after ten repetitions of putting the coin-bag into\nthe pouch, reaching in, whispering \"bag of gold\", and taking it\nout, Professor McGonagall took a step away and began examining some\nof the other items in the shop, and the shopkeeper turned her head\nto watch.",
      "Harry dropped the bag of gold into the mokeskin pouch with his\nleft hand; his right hand came out of his pocket\ntightly holding some of the gold coins, reached into the mokeskin\npouch, dropped the loose Galleons, and (with a whisper of \"bag of\ngold\") retrieved the original bag. Then the bag went back into his\nleft hand, to be dropped in again, and Harry's\nright hand went back into his pocket...",
      "Professor McGonagall looked back at him once, but Harry managed\nto avoid freezing or flinching, and she didn't seem to notice\nanything. Though you never did quite know, with the adults\nthat had a sense of humour. It took three iterations to get the job\ndone, and Harry guessed he'd managed to steal maybe thirty Galleons\nfrom himself.",
      "Harry reached up, wiped a bit of sweat from his forehead, and\nexhaled. \"I'd like this one, please.\"",
      "Fifteen Galleons lighter (twice the price of a wizard's wand,\napparently) and one Moke Super Pouch QX31 heavier, Harry and\nProfessor McGonagall pushed their way out of the door. The door\nformed a hand and waved goodbye to them as they left, extruding its\narm in a way that made Harry feel a bit queasy.",
      "And then, unfortunately...",
      "\"Are you really Harry Potter?\" whispered the old man,\none huge tear sliding down his cheek. \"You wouldn't lie about that,\nwould you? Only I'd heard rumours that you didn't really\nsurvive the Killing Curse and that's why no one ever heard from you\nagain.\"",
      "...it seemed that Professor McGonagall's disguise spell was less\nthan perfectly effective against more experienced magical\npractitioners.",
      "Professor McGonagall had laid a hand on Harry's shoulder and\nyanked him into the nearest alleyway the moment she'd heard \"Harry\nPotter?\" The old man had followed, but at least it looked like no\none else had heard.",
      "Harry considered the question. Was he really Harry\nPotter? \"I only know what other people have told me,\" Harry said.\n\"It's not like I remember being born.\" His hand brushed his\nforehead. \"I've had this scar as long as I remember, and I've been\ntold my name was Harry Potter as long as I remember. But,\" Harry\nsaid thoughtfully, \"if there's already sufficient cause to\npostulate a conspiracy, there's no reason why they wouldn't just\nfind another orphan and raise him to believe that he was\nHarry Potter -\"",
      "Professor McGonagall drew her hand over her face in\nexasperation. \"You look just about exactly like your father, James,\nthe year he first attended Hogwarts. And I can attest on the basis\nof personality alone that you are related to the Scourge\nof Gryffindor.\"",
      "\"She could be in on it too,\" Harry observed.",
      "\"No,\" quavered the old man. \"She's right. You have your mother's\neyes.\"",
      "\"Hmm,\" Harry frowned. \"I suppose you could be in on it\ntoo -\"",
      "\"Enough, Mr. Potter.\"",
      "The old man raised up a hand as if to touch Harry, but then let\nit fall. \"I'm just glad that you're alive,\" he murmured. \"Thank\nyou, Harry Potter. Thank you for what you did... I'll leave you\nalone now.\"",
      "And his cane slowly tapped away, out the alley and down the main\nstreet of Diagon Alley.",
      "The Professor looked around, her expression tense and grim.\nHarry automatically looked around himself. But the alley seemed\nempty of all but old leaves, and from the mouth leading out into\nDiagon Alley, only swiftly striding passersby could be seen.",
      "Finally Professor McGonagall seemed to relax. \"That was not well\ndone,\" she said in a low voice. \"I know you're not used to this,\nMr. Potter, but people do care about you. Please be kind to\nthem.\"",
      "Harry looked down at his shoes. \"They shouldn't,\" he said with a\ntinge of bitterness. \"Care about me, I mean.\"",
      "\"You saved them from You-Know-Who,\" said Professor McGonagall.\n\"How should they not care?\"",
      "Harry looked up at the witch-lady's strict expression beneath\nher pointed hat, and sighed. \"I suppose there's no chance that if I\nsaid fundamental attribution error you'd have any idea\nwhat that meant.\"",
      "\"No,\" said the Professor in her precise Scottish accent, \"but\nplease explain, Mr. Potter, if you would be so kind.\"",
      "\"Well...\" Harry said, trying to figure out how to describe that\nparticular bit of Muggle science. \"Suppose you come into work and\nsee your colleague kicking his desk. You think, 'what an angry\nperson he must be'. Your colleague is thinking about how someone\nbumped him into a wall on the way to work and then shouted at him.\nAnyone would be angry at that, he thinks. When we look at\nothers we see personality traits that explain their behaviour, but\nwhen we look at ourselves we see circumstances that explain our\nbehaviour. People's stories make internal sense to them, from the\ninside, but we don't see people's histories trailing behind them in\nthe air. We only see them in one situation, and we don't see what\nthey would be like in a different situation. So the fundamental\nattribution error is that we explain by permanent, enduring traits\nwhat would be better explained by circumstance and context.\" There\nwere some elegant experiments which confirmed this, but Harry\nwasn't about to go into them.",
      "The witch's eyebrows drew up beneath her hat's brim. \"I think I\nunderstand...\" Professor McGonagall said slowly. \"But what does\nthat have to do with you?\"",
      "Harry kicked the brick wall of the alley hard enough to make his\nfoot hurt. \"People think that I saved them from You-Know-Who\nbecause I'm some kind of great warrior of the Light.\"",
      "\"The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord...\" murmured\nthe witch, a strange irony leavening her voice.",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry said, annoyance and frustration warring in him,\n\"like I destroyed the Dark Lord because I have some kind of\npermanent, enduring destroy-the-Dark-Lord trait. I was fifteen\nmonths old at the time! I don't know what happened, but I\nwould suppose it had something to do with, as the saying\ngoes, contingent environmental circumstances. And certainly nothing\nto do with my personality. People don't care about me,\nthey aren't even paying attention to me, they want to\nshake hands with a bad explanation.\" Harry paused, and\nlooked at McGonagall. \"Do you know what really\nhappened?\"",
      "\"I have formed an idea...\" said Professor McGonagall.\n\"After meeting you, that is.\"",
      "\"Yes?\"",
      "\"You triumphed over the Dark Lord by being more awful than\nhe was, and survived the Killing Curse by being more\nterrible than Death.\"",
      "\"Ha. Ha. Ha.\" Harry kicked the wall again.",
      "Professor McGonagall chuckled. \"Let's get you to Madam Malkin's\nnext. I fear your Muggle clothing may be attracting attention.\"",
      "They ran into two more well-wishers along the way.",
      "Madam Malkin's Robes had a genuinely boring shopfront, red\nordinary brick, and glass windows showing plain black robes within.\nNot robes that shone or changed or spun, or radiated strange rays\nthat seemed to go right through your shirt and tickle you. Just\nplain black robes, that was all you could see through the window.\nThe door was propped wide open, as if to advertise that there were\nno secrets here and nothing to hide.",
      "\"I'm going to go off for a few minutes while you get fitted for\nyour robes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Will you be all right with\nthat, Mr. Potter?\"",
      "Harry nodded. He hated clothes shopping with a fiery passion and\ncouldn't blame the older witch for feeling the same way.",
      "Professor McGonagall's wand came out of her sleeve, tapped\nHarry's head lightly. \"And as you'll need to be clear to Madam\nMalkin's senses, I am removing the Obfuscation.\"",
      "\"Uh...\" Harry said. That did worry him a little; he still wasn't\nused to the 'Harry Potter' thing.",
      "\"I went to Hogwarts with Madam Malkin,\" McGonagall said. \"Even\nthen, she was one of the most composed people I knew. She\nwouldn't turn a hair if You-Know-Who himself walked into her shop.\"\nMcGonagall's voice was reminiscent, and very approving. \"Madam\nMalkin won't bother you, and she won't let anyone else bother\nyou.\"",
      "\"Where are you going?\" Harry inquired. \"Just in case,\nyou know, something does happen.\"",
      "McGonagall gave Harry a hard look. \"I am going there,\"\nshe said, pointing at a building across the street which showed the\nsign of a wooden keg, \"and buying a drink, which I desperately\nneed. You are to get fitted for your robes, nothing\nelse. I will come back to check up on you shortly,\nand I expect to find Madam Malkin's shop still standing\nand not in any way on fire.\"",
      "Madam Malkin was a bustling old woman who didn't say a word\nabout Harry when she saw the scar on his forehead, and she shot a\nsharp look at an assistant when that girl seemed about to say\nsomething. Madam Malkin got out a set of animated, writhing bits of\ncloth that seemed to serve as tape measures and set to work\nexamining the medium of her art.",
      "Next to Harry, a pale young boy with a pointed face and\nawesomecool blonde-white hair seemed to be going through\nthe final stages of a similar process. One of Malkin's two\nassistants was examining the white-haired boy and the\nchequerboard-gridded robe he was wearing; occasionally she would\ntap a corner of the robe with her wand, and the robe would loosen\nor tighten.",
      "\"Hello,\" said the boy. \"Hogwarts, too?\"",
      "Harry could predict where this conversation was about to go, and\nhe decided in a split second of frustration that enough was\nenough.",
      "\"Good heavens,\" whispered Harry, \"it couldn't be.\" He let his\neyes widen. \"Your... name, sir?\"",
      "\"Draco Malfoy,\" said Draco Malfoy, looking slightly puzzled.",
      "\"It is you! Draco Malfoy. I - I never thought I'd be so\nhonoured, sir.\" Harry wished he could make tears come out of his\neyes. The others usually started crying at around this point.",
      "\"Oh,\" said Draco, sounding a little confused. Then his lips\nstretched in a smug smile. \"It's good to meet someone who knows his\nplace.\"",
      "One of the assistants, the one who'd seemed to recognise Harry,\nmade a muffled choking sound.",
      "Harry burbled on. \"I'm delighted to meet you, Mr. Malfoy. Just\nunutterably delighted. And to be attending Hogwarts in your very\nyear! It makes my heart swoon.\"",
      "Oops. That last part might have sounded a little odd, like he\nwas flirting with Draco or something.",
      "\"And I am pleased to learn that I shall be treated with\nthe respect due to the family of Malfoy,\" the other boy lobbed\nback, accompanied by a smile such as the highest of kings might\nbestow upon the least of his subjects, if that subject were honest,\nthough poor.",
      "Eh... Damn, Harry was having trouble thinking up his next line.\nWell, everyone did want to shake the hand of Harry Potter,\nso - \"When my clothes are fitted, sir, might you deign to shake my\nhand? I should wish nothing more to put the capper upon this day,\nnay, this month, indeed, my whole lifetime.\"",
      "The white-blonde-haired boy glared in return. \"And what have\nyou done for the Malfoys that entitles you to such a\nfavour?\"",
      "Oh, I am so totally trying this routine on the next person\nwho wants to shake my hand. Harry bowed his head. \"No, no,\nsir, I understand. I'm sorry for asking. I should be honoured to\nclean your boots, rather.\"",
      "\"Indeed,\" snapped the other boy. His stern face lightened\nsomewhat. \"Tell me, what House do you think you might be sorted\ninto? I'm bound for Slytherin House, of course, like my father\nLucius before me. And for you, I'd guess House Hufflepuff, or\npossibly House Elf.\"",
      "Harry grinned sheepishly. \"Professor McGonagall says that I'm\nthe most Ravenclaw person she's ever seen or heard tell of in\nlegend, so much so that Rowena herself would tell me to get out\nmore, whatever that means, and that I'll undoubtedly end\nup in Ravenclaw House if the hat isn't screaming too loudly for the\nrest of us to make out any words, end quote.\"",
      "\"Wow,\" said Draco Malfoy, sounding slightly impressed. The boy\ngave a sort of wistful sigh. \"Your flattery was great, or I thought\nso, anyway - you'd do well in Slytherin House, too. Usually it's\nonly my father who gets that sort of grovelling. I'm\nhoping the other Slytherins will suck up to me now I'm at\nHogwarts... I guess this is a good sign, then.\"",
      "Harry coughed. \"Actually, sorry, I've got no idea who you are\nreally.\"",
      "\"Oh come on!\u202f\" the boy said with fierce disappointment.\n\"Why'd you go and do that, then?\" Draco's eyes widened with sudden\nsuspicion. \"And how do you not know about the Malfoys? And\nwhat are those clothes you're wearing? Are your parents\nMuggles?\u202f\"",
      "\"Two of my parents are dead,\" Harry said. His heart twinged.\nWhen he put it that way - \"My other two parents are Muggles, and\nthey're the ones that raised me.\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" said Draco. \"Who are you?\"",
      "\"Harry Potter, pleased to meet you.\"",
      "\"Harry Potter?\u202f\" gasped Draco. \"The Harry -\"\nand the boy cut off abruptly.",
      "There was a brief silence.",
      "Then, with bright enthusiasm, \"Harry Potter? The Harry\nPotter? Gosh, I've always wanted to meet you!\"",
      "Draco's attendant emitted a sound like she was strangling but\nkept on with her work, lifting Draco's arms to carefully remove the\nchequered robe.",
      "\"Shut up,\" Harry suggested.",
      "\"Can I have your autograph? No, wait, I want a picture with you\nfirst!\"",
      "\"Shutupshutupshutup.\"",
      "\"I'm just so delighted to meet you!\"",
      "\"Burst into flames and die.\"",
      "\"But you're Harry Potter, the glorious saviour of the wizarding\nworld! Everyone's hero, Harry Potter! I've always wanted to be just\nlike you when I grow up so I can -\"",
      "Draco cut off the words in mid-sentence, his face freezing in\nabsolute horror.",
      "Tall, white-haired, coldly elegant in black robes of the finest\nquality. One hand gripping a silver-handled cane which took on the\ncharacter of a deadly weapon just by being in that hand. His eyes\nregarded the room with the dispassionate quality of an executioner,\na man to whom killing was not painful, or even deliciously\nforbidden, but just a routine activity like breathing.",
      "That was the man who had, just that moment, strolled in through\nthe open door.",
      "\"Draco,\" said the man, low and very angry, \"what are\nyou saying?\u202f\"",
      "In one split second of sympathetic panic, Harry formulated a\nrescue plan.",
      "\"Lucius Malfoy!\" gasped Harry Potter. \"The Lucius\nMalfoy?\"",
      "One of Malkin's assistants had to turn away and face the\nwall.",
      "Coolly murderous eyes regarded him. \"Harry Potter.\"",
      "\"I am so, so honoured to meet you!\"",
      "The dark eyes widened, shocked surprise replacing deadly\nthreat.",
      "\"Your son has been telling me all about you,\" Harry\ngushed on, hardly even knowing what was coming out of his mouth but\njust talking as fast as possible. \"But of course I knew about you\nall before then, everyone knows about you, the great Lucius Malfoy!\nThe most honoured laureate of all the House of Slytherin, I've been\nthinking about trying to get into Slytherin House myself just\nbecause I heard you were in it as a child -\"",
      "\"What are you saying, Mr. Potter?\u202f\" came a near-scream\nfrom outside the shop, and Professor McGonagall burst in a second\nlater.",
      "There was such pure horror on her face that Harry's mouth opened\nautomatically, and then blocked on nothing-to-say.",
      "\"Professor McGonagall!\" cried Draco. \"Is it really you? I've\nheard so much about you from my father, I've been thinking of\ntrying to get Sorted into Gryffindor so I can -\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" bellowed Lucius Malfoy and Professor\nMcGonagall in perfect unison, standing side-by-side. Their heads\nswivelled to look at each other in duplicate motions, and then the\ntwo recoiled from one another as though performing a synchronised\ndance.",
      "There was a sudden flurry of action as Lucius seized Draco and\ndragged him out of the shop.",
      "And then there was silence.",
      "In Professor McGonagall's left hand lay a small drinking-glass,\ntilted over to one side in the forgotten rush, now slowly dripping\ndrops of alcohol into the tiny puddle of red wine that had appeared\non the floor.",
      "Professor McGonagall strode forward into the shop until she was\nopposite Madam Malkin.",
      "\"Madam Malkin,\" said Professor McGonagall, her voice calm. \"What\nhas been happening here?\"",
      "Madam Malkin looked back silently for four seconds, and then\ncracked up. She fell against the wall, wheezing out laughter, and\nthat set off both of her assistants, one of whom fell to her hands\nand knees on the floor, giggling hysterically.",
      "Professor McGonagall slowly turned to look at Harry, her\nexpression chilly. \"I leave you alone for six minutes. Six minutes,\nMr. Potter, by the very clock.\"",
      "\"I was only joking around,\" Harry protested, as the sounds of\nhysterical laughter went on nearby.",
      "\"Draco Malfoy said in front of his father that he wanted to\nbe sorted into Gryffindor! Joking around isn't enough\nto do that!\" Professor McGonagall paused, visibly taking\nbreaths. \"What part of 'get fitted for robes' sounded to you like\nplease cast a Confundus Charm on the entire\nuniverse!\u202f\"",
      "\"He was in a situational context where those actions made\ninternal sense -\"",
      "\"No. Don't explain. I don't want to know what happened in here,\never. Whatever dark power inhabits you, it is contagious,\nand I don't want to end up like poor Draco Malfoy, poor Madam\nMalkin and her two poor assistants.\"",
      "Harry sighed. It was clear that Professor McGonagall wasn't in a\nmood to listen to reasonable explanations. He looked at Madam\nMalkin, who was still wheezing against the wall, and Malkin's two\nassistants, who had now both fallen to their knees, and\nfinally down at his own tape-measure-draped body.",
      "\"I'm not quite done being fitted for clothes,\" Harry said\nkindly. \"Why don't you go back and have another drink?\""

      "Some children would have waited until after\ntheir first trip to Diagon Alley.",
      "\"Bag of element 79,\" Harry said, and withdrew his hand, empty,\nfrom the mokeskin pouch.",
      "Most children would have at least waited to get their\nwands first.",
      "\"Bag of okane,\" said Harry. The heavy bag of gold\npopped up into his hand.",
      "Harry withdrew the bag, then plunged it again into the mokeskin\npouch. He took out his hand, put it back in, and said, \"Bag of\ntokens of economic exchange.\" That time his hand came out\nempty.",
      "\"Give me back the bag that I just put in.\" Out came the bag of\ngold once more.",
      "Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres had gotten his hands on at least\none magical item. Why wait?",
      "\"Professor McGonagall,\" Harry said to the bemused witch\nstrolling beside him, \"can you give me two words, one word for\ngold, and one word for something else that isn't money, in a\nlanguage that I wouldn't know? But don't tell me which is\nwhich.\"",
      "\"Ahava and zahav,\" said Professor McGonagall.\n\"That's Hebrew, and the other word means love.\"",
      "\"Thank you, Professor. Bag of ahava.\" Empty.",
      "\"Bag of zahav.\" And it popped up into his hand.",
      "\"Zahav is gold?\" Harry questioned, and Professor McGonagall\nnodded.",
      "Harry thought over his collected experimental data. It was only\nthe most crude and preliminary sort of effort, but it was enough to\nsupport at least one conclusion:",
      "\"Aaaaaaarrrgh this doesn't make any sense!\u202f\"",
      "The witch beside him lifted a lofty eyebrow. \"Problems, Mr.\nPotter?\"",
      "\"I just falsified every single hypothesis I had! How can it know\nthat 'bag of 115 Galleons' is okay but not 'bag of 90 plus 25\nGalleons'? It can count but it can't add? It can\nunderstand nouns, but not some noun phrases that mean the same\nthing? The person who made this probably didn't speak Japanese and\nI don't speak any Hebrew, so it's not using their\nknowledge, and it's not using my knowledge -\" Harry waved\na hand helplessly. \"The rules seem sorta consistent but\nthey don't mean anything! I'm not even going to ask how a\npouch ends up with voice recognition and natural language\nunderstanding when the best Artificial Intelligence programmers\ncan't get the fastest supercomputers to do it after thirty-five\nyears of hard work,\" Harry gasped for breath, \"but what is\ngoing on?\u202f\"",
      "\"Magic,\" said Professor McGonagall.",
      "\"That's just a word! Even after you tell me that, I\ncan't make any new predictions! It's exactly like saying\n'phlogiston' or 'elan vital' or 'emergence' or 'complexity'!\"",
      "The black-robed witch laughed aloud. \"But it is magic,\nMr. Potter.\"",
      "Harry slumped over a little. \"With respect, Professor\nMcGonagall, I'm not quite sure you understand what I'm trying to do\nhere.\"",
      "\"With respect, Mr. Potter, I'm quite sure I don't. Unless - this\nis just a guess, mind - you're trying to take over the world?\"",
      "\"No! I mean yes - well, no!\u202f\"",
      "\"I think I should perhaps be alarmed that you have trouble\nanswering the question.\"",
      "Harry glumly considered the Dartmouth Conference on Artificial\nIntelligence in 1956. It had been the first conference ever on the\ntopic, the one that had coined the phrase \"Artificial\nIntelligence\". They had identified key problems such as making\ncomputers understand language, learn, and improve themselves. They\nhad suggested, in perfect seriousness, that significant advances on\nthese problems might be made by ten scientists working together for\ntwo months.",
      "No. Chin up. You're just starting on the problem of\nunravelling all the secrets of magic. You don't actually know\nwhether it's going to be too difficult to do in two\nmonths.",
      "\"And you really haven't heard of other wizards asking\nthese sorts of questions or doing this sort of scientific\nexperimenting?\" Harry asked again. It just seemed so\nobvious to him.",
      "Then again, it'd taken more than two hundred years\nafter the invention of the scientific method before any\nMuggle scientists had thought to systematically investigate which\nsentences a human four-year-old could or couldn't\nunderstand. The developmental psychology of linguistics could've\nbeen discovered in the eighteenth century, in principle, but no one\nhad even thought to look until the twentieth. So you couldn't\nreally blame the much smaller wizarding world for not investigating\nthe Retrieval Charm.",
      "Professor McGonagall pursed her lips, then shrugged. \"I'm still\nnot sure what you mean by 'scientific experimenting', Mr. Potter.\nAs I said, I've seen Muggleborn students try to get Muggle science\nto work inside Hogwarts, and people invent new Charms and Potions\nevery year.\"",
      "Harry shook his head. \"Technology isn't the same thing as\nscience at all. And trying lots of different ways to do something\nisn't the same as experimenting to figure out the rules.\" There\nwere plenty of people who'd tried to invent flying machines by\ntrying out lots of things-with-wings, but only the Wright Brothers\nhad built a wind tunnel to measure lift... \"Um, how many\nMuggle-raised children do you get at Hogwarts every\nyear?\"",
      "\"Perhaps ten or so?\"",
      "Harry missed a step and almost tripped over his own feet.\n\"Ten?\u202f\"",
      "The Muggle world had a population of six billion and counting.\nIf you were one in a million, there were seven of you in London and\na thousand more in China. It was inevitable that the Muggle\npopulation would produce some eleven-year-olds who could\ndo calculus - Harry knew he wasn't the only one. He'd met other\nprodigies in mathematical competitions. In fact he'd been\nthoroughly trounced by competitors who probably spent literally\nall day practising maths problems and who'd never\nread a science-fiction book and who would burn out\ncompletely before puberty and never\namount to anything in their future lives because they'd\njust practised known techniques instead of learning to\nthink creatively. (Harry was something of a sore\nloser.)",
      "But... in the wizarding world...",
      "Ten Muggle-raised children per year, who'd all ended their\nMuggle educations at the age of eleven? And Professor McGonagall\nmight be biased, but she had claimed that Hogwarts was the largest\nand most eminent wizarding school in the world... and it only\neducated up to the age of seventeen.",
      "Professor McGonagall undoubtedly knew every last detail of how\nyou went about turning into a cat. But she seemed to have literally\nnever heard of the scientific method. To her it was just\nMuggle magic. And she didn't even seem curious about what\nsecrets might be hiding behind the natural language understanding\nof the Retrieval Charm.",
      "That left two possibilities, really.",
      "Possibility one: Magic was so incredibly opaque, convoluted, and\nimpenetrable, that even though wizards and witches had tried their\nbest to understand, they'd made little or no progress and\neventually given up; and Harry would do no better.",
      "Or...",
      "Harry cracked his knuckles in determination, but they only made\na quiet sort of clicking sound, rather than echoing ominously off\nthe walls of Diagon Alley.",
      "Possibility two: He'd be taking over the world.",
      "Eventually. Perhaps not right away.",
      "That sort of thing did sometimes take longer than two\nmonths. Muggle science hadn't gone to the moon in the first week\nafter Galileo.",
      "But Harry still couldn't stop the huge smile that was stretching\nhis cheeks so wide they were starting to hurt.",
      "Harry had always been frightened of ending up as one of those\nchild prodigies that never amounted to anything and spent the rest\nof their lives boasting about how far ahead they'd been at age ten.\nBut then most adult geniuses never amounted to anything either.\nThere were probably a thousand people as intelligent as Einstein\nfor every actual Einstein in history. Because those other geniuses\nhadn't gotten their hands on the one thing you absolutely needed to\nachieve greatness. They'd never found an important problem.",
      "You're mine now, Harry thought at the walls of Diagon\nAlley, and all the shops and items, and all the shopkeepers and\ncustomers; and all the lands and people of wizarding Britain, and\nall the wider wizarding world; and the entire greater universe of\nwhich Muggle scientists understood so much less than they believed.\nI, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, do now claim this territory\nin the name of Science.",
      "Lightning and thunder completely failed to flash and boom in the\ncloudless skies.",
      "\"What are you smiling about?\" inquired Professor McGonagall,\nwarily and wearily.",
      "\"I'm wondering if there's a spell to make lightning flash in the\nbackground whenever I make an ominous resolution,\" explained Harry.\nHe was carefully memorising the exact words of his ominous\nresolution so that future history books would get it right.",
      "\"I have the distinct feeling that I ought to be doing something\nabout this,\" sighed Professor McGonagall.",
      "\"Ignore it, it'll go away. Ooh, shiny!\" Harry put his thoughts\nof world conquest temporarily on hold and skipped over to a shop\nwith an open display, and Professor McGonagall followed.",
      "Harry had now bought his potions ingredients and cauldron, and,\noh, a few more things. Items that seemed like good things to carry\nin Harry's Bag of Holding (aka Moke Super Pouch QX31 with\nUndetectable Extension Charm, Retrieval Charm, and Widening Lip).\nSmart, sensible purchases.",
      "Harry genuinely didn't understand why Professor McGonagall was\nlooking so suspicious.",
      "Right now, Harry was in a shop expensive enough to display in\nthe twisting main street of Diagon Alley. The shop had an open\nfront with merchandise laid out on slanted wooden rows, guarded\nonly by slight grey glows and a young-looking salesgirl in a\nmuch-shortened version of witch's robes that exposed her knees and\nelbows.",
      "Harry was examining the wizarding equivalent of a first-aid kit,\nthe Emergency Healing Pack Plus. There were two self-tightening\ntourniquets. A syringe of what looked like liquid fire, which was\nsupposed to drastically slow circulation in a treated area while\nmaintaining oxygenation of the blood for up to three minutes, if\nyou needed to prevent a poison from spreading through the body.\nWhite cloth that could be wrapped over a part of the body to\ntemporarily numb pain. Plus any number of other items that Harry\ntotally failed to comprehend, like the \"Dementor Exposure\nTreatment\", which looked and smelled like ordinary chocolate. Or\nthe \"Bafflesnaffle Counter\", which looked like a small quivering\negg and carried a placard showing how to jam it up someone's\nnostril.",
      "\"A definite buy at five Galleons, wouldn't you agree?\" Harry\nsaid to Professor McGonagall, and the teenage salesgirl hovering\nnearby nodded eagerly.",
      "Harry had expected the Professor to make some sort of approving\nremark about his prudence and preparedness.",
      "What he was getting instead could only be described as the Evil\nEye.",
      "\"And just why,\" Professor McGonagall said with heavy\nscepticism, \"do you expect to need a healer's kit, young\nman?\" (After the unfortunate incident at the Potions shop,\nProfessor McGonagall was trying to avoid saying \"Mr. Potter\" while\nanyone else was nearby.)",
      "Harry's mouth opened and closed. \"I don't expect to\nneed it! It's just in case!\"",
      "\"Just in case of what?\u202f\"",
      "Harry's eyes widened. \"You think I'm planning to do\nsomething dangerous and that's why I want a medical\nkit?\"",
      "A look of grim suspicion and ironic disbelief was the\nanswer.",
      "\"Great Scott!\" said Harry. (This was an expression he'd learned\nfrom the mad scientist Doc Brown in Back to the Future.)\n\"Were you also thinking that when I bought the Feather-Falling\nPotion, the Gillyweed, and the bottle of Food and Water Pills?\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "Harry shook his head in amazement. \"Just what sort of plan do\nyou think I have going, here?\"",
      "\"I don't know,\" Professor McGonagall said darkly, \"but it ends\neither in you delivering a ton of silver to Gringotts, or in world\ndomination.\"",
      "\"World domination is such an ugly phrase. I prefer to call it\nworld optimisation.\"",
      "This hilarious joke failed to reassure the witch giving him the\nLook of Doom.",
      "\"Wow,\" Harry said, as he realised that she was serious. \"You\nreally think that. You really think I'm planning to do something\ndangerous.\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"Like that's the only reason anyone would ever buy a\nfirst-aid kit? Don't take this the wrong way, Professor McGonagall,\nbut what sort of crazy children are you used to dealing\nwith?\"",
      "\"Gryffindors,\" spat Professor McGonagall, the word carrying a\nfreight of bitterness and despair that fell like an eternal curse\non all youthful enthusiasm and high spirits.",
      "\"Deputy Headmistress Professor Minerva McGonagall,\" Harry said,\nputting his hands sternly on his hips. \"I am not going to be in\nGryffindor -\"",
      "At this point the Deputy Headmistress interjected something\nabout how if he was she would figure out how to kill a\nhat, which odd remark Harry let pass without comment, though the\nsalesgirl seemed to be having a sudden coughing fit.",
      "\"- I am going to be in Ravenclaw. And if you really think that\nI'm planning to do something dangerous, then, honestly, you don't\nunderstand me at all. I don't like danger, it is\nscary. I am being prudent. I am being\ncautious. I am preparing for unforeseen\ncontingencies. Like my parents used to sing to me: Be\nprepared! That's the Boy Scout's marching song! Be prepared! As\nthrough life you march along! Don't be nervous, don't be flustered,\ndon't be scared - be prepared!\u202f\"",
      "(Harry's parents had in fact only ever sung him those\nparticular lines of that Tom Lehrer song, and Harry was\nblissfully unaware of the rest.)",
      "Professor McGonagall's stance had slightly softened - though\nmostly when Harry had said that he was heading for Ravenclaw. \"What\nsort of contingency do you imagine this kit might prepare\nyou for, young man?\u202f\"",
      "\"One of my classmates gets bitten by a horrible monster, and as\nI scrabble frantically in my mokeskin pouch for something that\ncould help her, she looks at me sadly and with her last breath\nsays, 'Why weren't you prepared?' And then she dies, and I\nknow as her eyes close that she won't ever forgive me -\"",
      "Harry heard the salesgirl gasp, and he looked up to see her\nstaring at him with her lips pressed tight. Then the young woman\nwhirled and fled into the deeper recesses of the shop.",
      "What...?",
      "Professor McGonagall reached down, and took Harry's hand in\nhers, gently but firmly, and pulled Harry out of the main street of\nDiagon Alley, leading him into an alleyway between two shops which\nwas paved in dirty bricks and dead-ended in a wall of solid black\ndirt.",
      "The tall witch pointed her wand at the main street and spoke,\n\"Quietus\" she said, and a screen of silence descended\naround them, blocking out all the street noises.",
      "What did I do wrong...",
      "Professor McGonagall turned to regard Harry. She didn't have a\nfull adult Wrongdoing Face, but her expression was flat,\ncontrolled. \"You must remember, Mr. Potter,\" she said, \"that there\nwas a war in this country not ten years ago. Everyone has lost\nsomeone, and to speak of friends dying in your arms - is not done\nlightly.\"",
      "\"I - I didn't mean to -\" The inference dropped like a falling\nstone into Harry's exceptionally vivid imagination. He'd talked\nabout someone breathing their last breath - and then the salesgirl\nhad run away - and the war had ended ten years ago so that girl\nwould have been at most eight or nine years old, when, when, \"I'm\nsorry, I didn't mean to...\" Harry choked up, and turned away to run\nfrom the older witch's gaze but there was a wall of dirt blocking\nhis way and he didn't have his wand yet. \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm\nsorry!\u202f\"",
      "There came a heavy sigh from behind him. \"I know you are, Mr.\nPotter.\"",
      "Harry dared to peek behind him. Professor McGonagall only seemed\nsad, now. \"I'm sorry,\" Harry said again, feeling wretched. \"Did\nanything like that happen to -\" and then Harry shut his lips and\nslapped a hand over his mouth for good measure.",
      "The older witch's face grew a little sadder. \"You must learn to\nthink before you speak, Mr. Potter, or else go through life without\nmany friends. That has been the fate of many a Ravenclaw, and I\nhope it will not be yours.\"",
      "Harry wanted to just run away. He wanted to pull out a wand and\nerase the whole thing from Professor McGonagall's memory, be back\nwith her outside the shop again, make it didn't happen\n-",
      "\"But to answer your question, Mr. Potter, no, nothing like\nthat has ever happened to me. Certainly I've watched a\nfriend breathe their last, once or seven times. But not one of them\never cursed me as they died, and I never thought that they wouldn't\nforgive me. Why would you say such a thing, Mr. Potter?\nWhy would you even think it?\"",
      "\"I, I, I,\" Harry swallowed. \"It's just that I always try to\nimagine the worst thing that could happen,\" and maybe he'd also\nbeen joking around a little but he would rather have bitten off his\nown tongue than say that now.",
      "\"What?\" said Professor McGonagall. \"But why?\"",
      "\"So I can stop it from happening!\"",
      "\"Mr. Potter...\" the older witch's voice trailed off. Then she\nsighed, and knelt down beside him. \"Mr. Potter,\" she said, gently\nnow, \"it's not your responsibility to take care of the students at\nHogwarts. It's mine. I won't let anything bad happen to you or\nanyone else. Hogwarts is the safest place for magical children in\nall the wizarding world, and Madam Pomfrey has a full healer's\noffice. You won't need a healer's kit at all, let alone a\nfive-Galleon one.\"",
      "\"But I do!\u202f\" Harry burst out. \"Nowhere is\nperfectly safe! And what if my parents have a heart attack or get\nin an accident when I go home for Christmas - Madam Pomfrey won't\nbe there, I'll need a healer's kit of my own -\"",
      "\"What in Merlin's name...\" Professor McGonagall said.\nShe stood up, and looked down at Harry an expression torn between\nannoyance and concern. \"There's no need to think about such\nterrible things, Mr. Potter!\"",
      "Harry's expression twisted up into bitterness, hearing that.\n\"Yes there is! If you don't think, you don't just get hurt\nyourself, you end up hurting other people!\"",
      "Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, then closed it. The witch\nrubbed the bridge of her nose, looking thoughtful. \"Mr. Potter...\nif I were to offer to listen to you for a while... is there\nanything you'd like to talk to me about?\"",
      "\"About what?\"",
      "\"About why you're convinced you must always be on your guard\nagainst terrible things happening to you.\"",
      "Harry stared at her in puzzlement. That was a self-evident\naxiom. \"Well...\" Harry said slowly. He tried to organise his\nthoughts. How could he explain himself to a\nProfessor-witch, when she didn't even know the basics? \"Muggle\nresearchers have found that people are always very optimistic,\ncompared to reality. Like they say something will take two days and\nit takes ten days, or they say it'll take two months and it takes\nover thirty-five years. For example, in one experiment, they asked\nstudents for times by which they were 50% sure, 75% sure, and 99%\nsure they'd complete their homework, and only 13%, 19%, and 45% of\nthe students finished by those times. And they found that the\nreason was that when they asked one group for their best-case\nestimates if everything went as well as possible, and another group\nfor their average-case estimates if everything went as usual, they\ngot back answers that were statistically indistinguishable. See, if\nyou ask someone what they expect in the normal case, they\nvisualise what looks like the line of maximum probability at each\nstep along the way - everything going according to plan, with no\nsurprises. But actually, since more than half the students didn't\nfinish by the time they were 99% sure they'd be done, reality\nusually delivers results a little worse than the 'worst-case\nscenario'. It's called the planning fallacy, and the best way to\nfix it is to ask how long things took the last time you tried them.\nThat's called using the outside view instead of the inside view.\nBut when you're doing something new and can't do that, you just\nhave to be really, really, really pessimistic. Like, so pessimistic\nthat reality actually comes out better than you expected\naround as often and as much as it comes out worse. It's actually\nreally hard to be so pessimistic that you stand a\ndecent chance of undershooting real life. Like I make this\nbig effort to be gloomy and I imagine one of my classmates getting\nbitten, but what actually happens is that the surviving Death\nEaters attack the whole school to get at me. But on a happier note\n-\"",
      "\"Stop,\" said Professor McGonagall.",
      "Harry stopped. He had just been about to point out that at least\nthey knew the Dark Lord wouldn't attack, since he was dead.",
      "\"I think I might not have made myself clear,\" the witch said,\nher precise Scottish voice sounding even more careful. \"Did\nanything happen to you personally that frightened you, Mr.\nPotter?\"",
      "\"What happened to me personally is only anecdotal evidence,\"\nHarry explained. \"It doesn't carry the same weight as a replicated,\npeer-reviewed journal article about a controlled study with random\nassignment, many subjects, large effect sizes and strong\nstatistical significance.\"",
      "Professor McGonagall pinched the bridge of her nose, inhaled,\nand exhaled. \"I would still like to hear about it,\" she said.",
      "\"Um...\" Harry said. He took a deep breath. \"There'd been some\nmuggings in our neighborhood, and my mother asked me to return a\npan she'd borrowed to a neighbor two streets away, and I said I\ndidn't want to because I might get mugged, and she said, 'Harry,\ndon't say things like that!' Like thinking about it would\nmake it happen, so if I didn't talk about it, I would be\nsafe. I tried to explain why I wasn't reassured, and she made me\ncarry over the pan anyway. I was too young to know how\nstatistically unlikely it was for a mugger to target me, but I was\nold enough to know that not-thinking about something doesn't stop\nit from happening, so I was really scared.\"",
      "\"Nothing else?\" Professor McGonagall said after a pause, when it\nbecame clear that Harry was done. \"There isn't anything\nelse that happened to you?\"",
      "\"I know it doesn't sound like much,\" Harry defended.\n\"But it was just one of those critical life moments, you see? I\nmean, I knew that not thinking about something doesn't\nstop it from happening, I knew that, but I could see that\nMum really thought that way.\" Harry stopped, struggling with the\nanger that was starting to rise up again when he thought about it.\n\"She wouldn't listen. I tried to tell her, I\nbegged her not to send me out, and she laughed it\noff. Everything I said, she treated like some sort of big\njoke...\" Harry forced the black rage back down again. \"That's when\nI realised that everyone who was supposed to protect me was\nactually crazy, and that they wouldn't listen to me no matter how\nmuch I begged them, and that I couldn't ever rely on them to get\nanything right.\" Sometimes good intentions weren't enough,\nsometimes you had to be sane...",
      "There was a long silence.",
      "Harry took the time to breathe deeply and calm himself down.\nThere was no point in getting angry. There was no point in getting\nangry. All parents were like that, no adult would\nlower themselves far enough to place themselves on level ground\nwith a child and listen, his genetic parents would have been no\ndifferent. Sanity was a tiny spark in the night, an infinitesimally\nrare exception to the rule of madness, so there was no point in\ngetting angry.",
      "Harry didn't like himself when he was angry.",
      "\"Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Potter,\" said Professor\nMcGonagall after a while. There was an abstracted look on her face\n(almost exactly the same look that had appeared on Harry's own face\nwhile experimenting on the pouch, if Harry had only seen himself in\na mirror to realise that). \"I shall have to think about this.\" She\nturned towards the alley mouthway, and raised her wand -",
      "\"Um,\" Harry said, \"can we go get the healer's kit now?\"",
      "The witch paused, and looked back at him steadily. \"And if I say\nno - that it is too expensive and you won't need it - then\nwhat?\"",
      "Harry's face twisted in bitterness. \"Exactly what you're\nthinking, Professor McGonagall. Exactly what you're\nthinking. I conclude you're another crazy adult I can't talk to,\nand I start planning how to get my hands on a healer's kit\nanyway.\"",
      "\"I am your guardian on this trip,\" Professor McGonagall said\nwith a tinge of danger. \"I will not allow you to push me\naround.\"",
      "\"I understand,\" Harry said. He kept the resentment out of his\nvoice, and didn't say any of the other things that came to mind.\nProfessor McGonagall had told him to think before he spoke. He\nprobably wouldn't remember that tomorrow, but he could at least\nremember it for five minutes.",
      "The witch's wand made a slight circle in her hand, and the\nnoises of Diagon Alley came back. \"All right, young man,\" she said.\n\"Let's go get that healer's kit.\"",
      "Harry's jaw dropped in surprise. Then he hurried after her,\nalmost stumbling in his sudden rush.",
      "The shop was the same as they had left it, recognisable and\nunrecognisable items still laid out on the slanted wooden display,\nthe grey glow still protecting and the salesgirl back in her old\nposition. The salesgirl looked up as they approached, her face\nshowing surprise.",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" she said as they got closer, and Harry spoke at\nalmost the same moment, \"I apologise for -\"",
      "They broke off and looked at each other, and then the salesgirl\nlaughed a little. \"I didn't mean to get you in trouble with\nProfessor McGonagall,\" she said. Her voice lowered\nconspiratorially. \"I hope she wasn't too awful to\nyou.\"",
      "\"Della!\u202f\" said Professor McGonagall, sounding\nscandalised.",
      "\"Bag of gold,\" Harry said to his pouch, and then looked back up\nat the salesgirl while he counted out five Galleons. \"Don't worry,\nI understand that she's only awful to me because she loves me.\"",
      "He counted out five Galleons to the salesgirl while Professor\nMcGonagall was spluttering something unimportant. \"One Emergency\nHealing Pack Plus, please.\"",
      "It was actually sort of unnerving to see how the Widening Lip\nswallowed the briefcase-sized medical kit. Harry couldn't help\nwondering what would happen if he tried climbing into the mokeskin\npouch himself, given that only the person who put something in was\nsupposed to be able to take it out again.",
      "When the pouch was done... eating... his hard-won purchase,\nHarry swore he heard a small burping sound afterward. That\nhad to have been spelled in on purpose. The alternative\nhypothesis was too horrifying to contemplate... in fact Harry\ncouldn't even think of any alternative hypotheses. Harry\nlooked back up at the Professor, as they began walking through\nDiagon Alley once more. \"Where to next?\"",
      "Professor McGonagall pointed toward a shop that looked as if it\nhad been made from flesh instead of bricks and covered in fur\ninstead of paint. \"Small pets are permitted at Hogwarts - you could\nget an owl to send letters, for example -\"",
      "\"Can I pay a Knut or something and rent an owl when I\nneed to send mail?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall.",
      "\"Then I think emphatically no.\"",
      "Professor McGonagall nodded, as though ticking off a point.\n\"Might I ask why not?\"",
      "\"I had a pet rock once. It died.\"",
      "\"You don't think you could take care of a pet?\"",
      "\"I could,\" Harry said, \"but I would end up obsessing\nall day long about whether I'd remembered to feed it that day or if\nit was slowly starving in its cage, wondering where its master was\nand why there wasn't any food.\"",
      "\"That poor owl,\" the older witch said in a soft voice.\n\"Abandoned like that. I wonder what it would do.\"",
      "\"Well, I expect it'd get really hungry and start trying to claw\nits way out of the cage or the box or whatever, though it probably\nwouldn't have much luck with that -\" Harry stopped short.",
      "The witch went on, still in that soft voice. \"And what would\nhappen to it afterward?\"",
      "\"Excuse me,\" Harry said, and he reached up to take Professor\nMcGonagall by the hand, gently but firmly, and steered her into yet\nanother alleyway; after ducking so many well-wishers the process\nhad become almost unnoticeably routine. \"Please cast that silencing\nspell.\"",
      "\"Quietus.\"",
      "Harry's voice was shaking. \"That owl does not represent\nme, my parents never locked me in a cupboard and left me\nto starve, I do not have abandonment fears and I don't\nlike the trend of your thoughts, Professor McGonagall!\u202f\"",
      "The witch looked down at him gravely. \"And what thoughts would\nthose be, Mr. Potter?\"",
      "\"You think I was,\" Harry was having trouble saying it, \"I was\nabused?\u202f\"",
      "\"Were you?\"",
      "\"No!\u202f\" Harry shouted. \"No, I never was! Do you think\nI'm stupid? I know about the concept of child\nabuse, I know about inappropriate touching and all of that\nand if anything like that happened I would call the police! And\nreport it to the head teacher! And look up social services in the\nphone book! And tell Grandpa and Grandma and Mrs. Figg! But my\nparents never did anything like that, never ever\never! How dare you suggest such a thing!\"",
      "The older witch gazed at him steadily. \"It is my duty as Deputy\nHeadmistress to investigate possible signs of abuse in the children\nunder my care.\"",
      "Harry's anger was spiralling out of control into pure, black\nfury. \"Don't you ever dare breathe a word of these, these\ninsinuations to anyone else! No one, do you hear\nme, McGonagall? An accusation like that can ruin people and destroy\nfamilies even when the parents are completely innocent! I've read\nabout it in the newspapers!\" Harry's voice was climbing to a\nhigh-pitched scream. \"The system doesn't know how to\nstop, it doesn't believe the parents or the\nchildren when they say nothing happened! Don't you dare\nthreaten my family with that! I won't let you destroy my\nhome!\u202f\"",
      "\"Harry,\" the older witch said softly, and she reached out a hand\ntowards him -",
      "Harry took a fast step back, and his hand snapped up and knocked\nhers away.",
      "McGonagall froze, then she pulled her hand back, and took a step\nbackwards. \"Harry, it's all right,\" she said. \"I believe you.\"",
      "\"Do you,\" Harry hissed. The fury still roaring through\nhis blood. \"Or are you just waiting to get away from me so you can\nfile the papers?\"",
      "\"Harry, I saw your house. I saw you with your parents. They love\nyou. You love them. I do believe you when you say that your parents\nare not abusing you. But I had to ask, because there is\nsomething strange at work here.\"",
      "Harry stared at her coldly. \"Like what?\"",
      "\"Harry, I've seen many abused children in my time at Hogwarts,\nit would break your heart to know how many. And, when you're happy,\nyou don't behave like one of those children, not at all.\nYou smile at strangers, you hug people, I put my hand on your\nshoulder and you didn't flinch. But sometimes, only sometimes, you\nsay or do something that seems very much like... someone\nwho spent his first eleven years locked in a cellar. Not the loving\nfamily that I saw.\" Professor McGonagall tilted her head, her\nexpression growing puzzled again.",
      "Harry took this in, processing it. The black rage began to drain\naway, as it dawned on him that he was being listened to\nrespectfully, and that his family wasn't in danger.",
      "\"And how do you explain your observations, Professor\nMcGonagall?\"",
      "\"I don't know,\" she said. \"But it's possible that something\ncould have happened to you that you don't remember.\"",
      "Fury rose up again in Harry. That sounded all too much like what\nhe'd read in the newspaper stories of shattered families.\n\"Suppressed memory is a load of pseudoscience! People do\nnot repress traumatic memories, they remember them all\ntoo well for the rest of their lives!\"",
      "\"No, Mr. Potter. There is a Charm called Obliviation.\"",
      "Harry froze in place. \"A spell that erases memories?\"",
      "The older witch nodded. \"But not all the effects of the\nexperience, if you see what I'm saying, Mr. Potter.\"",
      "A chill went down Harry's spine. That hypothesis...\ncould not be easily refuted. \"But my parents couldn't do\nthat!\"",
      "\"Indeed not,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"It would have taken\nsomeone from the wizarding world. There's... no way to be certain,\nI'm afraid.\"",
      "Harry's rationalist skills began to boot up again. \"Professor\nMcGonagall, how sure are you of your observations, and what\nalternative explanations could there also be?\"",
      "The witch opened her hands, as though to show their emptiness.\n\"Sure? I'm sure of nothing, Mr. Potter. In all my life\nI've never met anyone else like you. Sometimes you just don't seem\neleven years old or even all that human.\"",
      "Harry's eyebrows rose toward the sky -",
      "\"I'm sorry!\" Professor McGonagall said quickly. \"I'm very sorry,\nMr. Potter. I was trying to make a point and I'm afraid that came\nout sounding different from what I had in mind -\"",
      "\"On the contrary, Professor McGonagall,\" Harry said, and slowly\nsmiled. \"I shall take it as a very great compliment. But would you\nmind if I offered an alternative explanation?\"",
      "\"Please do.\"",
      "\"Children aren't meant to be too much smarter than their\nparents,\" Harry said. \"Or too much saner, maybe - my father could\nprobably outsmart me if he was, you know, actually trying,\ninstead of using his adult intelligence mainly to come up with new\nreasons not to change his mind -\" Harry stopped. \"I'm too smart,\nProfessor. I've got nothing to say to normal children. Adults don't\nrespect me enough to really talk to me. And frankly, even if they\ndid, they wouldn't sound as smart as Richard Feynman, so I might as\nwell read something Richard Feynman wrote instead. I'm\nisolated, Professor McGonagall. I've been isolated my\nwhole life. Maybe that has some of the same effects as being locked\nin a cellar. And I'm too intelligent to look up to my parents the\nway that children are designed to do. My parents love me, but they\ndon't feel obliged to respond to reason, and sometimes I feel like\nthey're the children - children who won't listen and have\nabsolute authority over my whole existence. I try not to be too\nbitter about it, but I also try to be honest with myself,\nso, yes, I'm bitter. And I also have an anger management problem,\nbut I'm working on it. That's all.\"",
      "\"That's all?\u202f\"",
      "Harry nodded firmly. \"That's all. Surely, Professor McGonagall,\neven in magical Britain, the normal explanation is always worth\nconsidering?\u202f\"",
      "It was later in the day, the sun lowering in the summer sky and\nshoppers beginning to peter out from the streets. Some shops had\nalready closed; Harry and Professor McGonagall had bought his\ntextbooks from Flourish and Blotts just under the deadline. With\nonly a slight explosion when Harry had made a beeline for the\nkeyword \"Arithmancy\" and discovered that the seventh-year textbooks\ninvoked nothing more mathematically advanced than trigonometry.",
      "At this moment, though, dreams of low-hanging research fruit\nwere far from Harry's mind.",
      "At this moment, the two of them were walking out of\nOllivander's, and Harry was staring at his wand. He'd waved it, and\nproduced multicoloured sparks, which really shouldn't have come as\nsuch an extra shock after everything else he'd seen, but somehow\n-",
      "I can do magic.",
      "Me. As in, me personally. I am magical; I am a\nwizard.",
      "He had felt the magic pouring up his arm, and in that\ninstant, realised that he had always had that sense, that he had\npossessed it his whole life, the sense that was not sight or sound\nor smell or taste or touch but only magic. Like having eyes but\nkeeping them always closed, so that you didn't even realise that\nyou were seeing darkness; and then one day the eye opened, and saw\nthe world. The shock of it had poured through him, touching pieces\nof himself, awakening them, and then died away in seconds; leaving\nonly the certain knowledge that he was now a wizard, and always had\nbeen, and had even, in some strange way, always known it.",
      "And -",
      "\"It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for\nthis wand when its brother why, its brother gave you that\nscar.\"",
      "That could not possibly be coincidence. There had been\nthousands of wands in that shop. Well, okay, actually it\ncould be coincidence, there were six billion people in the\nworld and thousand-to-one coincidences happened every day. But\nBayes's Theorem said that any reasonable hypothesis which made it\nmore likely than a thousand-to-one that he'd end up with\nthe brother to the Dark Lord's wand, was going to have an\nadvantage.",
      "Professor McGonagall had simply said how peculiar and\nleft it at that, which had put Harry into a state of shock at the\nsheer, overwhelming uncuriosity of wizards and witches. In\nno imaginable world would Harry have just went \"Hm\" and\nwalked out of the shop without even trying to come up with\na hypothesis for what was going on.",
      "His left hand rose and touched his scar.",
      "What... exactly...",
      "\"You're a full wizard now,\" said Professor McGonagall.\n\"Congratulations.\"",
      "Harry nodded.",
      "\"And what do you think of the wizarding world?\" said she.",
      "\"It's strange,\" Harry said. \"I ought to be thinking about\neverything I've seen of magic... everything that I now know is\npossible, and everything I now know to be a lie, and all the work\nleft before me to understand it. And yet I find myself distracted\nby relative trivialities like,\" Harry lowered his voice, \"the whole\nBoy-Who-Lived thing.\" There didn't seem to be anyone nearby, but no\npoint tempting fate.",
      "Professor McGonagall ahemmed. \"Really? You don't\nsay.\"",
      "Harry nodded. \"Yes. It's just... odd. To find out that\nyou were part of this grand story, the quest to defeat the great\nand terrible Dark Lord, and it's already done. Finished.\nCompletely over with. Like you're Frodo Baggins and you find out\nthat your parents took you to Mount Doom and had you toss in the\nRing when you were one year old and you don't even remember\nit.\"",
      "Professor McGonagall's smile had grown somewhat fixed.",
      "\"You know, if I were anyone else, anyone else at all, I'd\nprobably be pretty worried about living up to that start. Gosh,\nHarry, what have you done since you defeated the Dark Lord? Your\nown bookshop? That's great! Say, did you know I named my child\nafter you? But I have hopes that this will not prove to be a\nproblem.\" Harry sighed. \"Still... it's almost enough to make me\nwish that there were some loose ends from the quest, just\nso I could say that I really, you know, participated\nsomehow.\"",
      "\"Oh?\" said Professor McGonagall in an odd tone. \"What did you\nhave in mind?\"",
      "\"Well, for example, you mentioned that my parents were betrayed.\nWho betrayed them?\"",
      "\"Sirius Black,\" the witch said, almost hissing the name. \"He's\nin Azkaban. Wizarding prison.\"",
      "\"How probable is it that Sirius Black will break out of prison\nand I'll have to track him down and defeat him in some sort of\nspectacular duel, or better yet put a large bounty on his head and\nhide out in Australia while I wait for the results?\"",
      "Professor McGonagall blinked. Twice. \"Not likely. No one has\never escaped from Azkaban, and I doubt that he will be the\nfirst.\"",
      "Harry was a bit sceptical of that \"no one has\never escaped from Azkaban\" line. Still, maybe with magic\nyou could actually get close to a 100% perfect prison, especially\nif you had a wand and they did not. The best way to get out would\nbe to not go there in the first place.",
      "\"All right then,\" Harry said. \"Sounds like it's been nicely\nwrapped up.\" He sighed, scrubbing his palm over his head. \"Or maybe\nthe Dark Lord didn't really die that night. Not\ncompletely. His spirit lingers, whispering to people in nightmares\nthat bleed over into the waking world, searching for a way back\ninto the living lands he swore to destroy, and now, in accordance\nwith the ancient prophecy, he and I are locked in a deadly duel\nwhere the winner shall lose and the loser shall win -\"",
      "Professor McGonagall's head swivelled, and her eyes darted\naround, as though to search the street for listeners.",
      "\"I'm joking, Professor,\" Harry said with some\nannoyance. Sheesh, why did she always take everything so seriously\n-",
      "A slow sinking sensation began to dawn in the pit of Harry's\nstomach.",
      "Professor McGonagall looked at Harry with a calm expression. A\nvery, very calm expression. Then a smile was put on. \"Of\ncourse you are, Mr. Potter.\"",
      "Aw crap.",
      "If Harry had needed to formalise the wordless inference that had\njust flashed into his mind, it would have come out something like,\n'If I estimate the probability of Professor McGonagall doing what I\njust saw as the result of carefully controlling herself, versus the\nprobability distribution for all the things she would do\nnaturally if I made a bad joke, then this behavior is\nsignificant evidence for her hiding something.'",
      "But what Harry actually thought was, Aw crap.",
      "Harry turned his own head to scan the street. Nope, no one\nnearby. \"He's not dead, is he,\" Harry sighed.",
      "\"Mr. Potter -\"",
      "\"The Dark Lord is alive. Of course he's alive. It was\nan act of utter optimism for me to have even\ndreamed otherwise. I must have taken leave of my\nsenses, I can't imagine what I was\nthinking. Just because someone said that his body\nwas found burned to a crisp, I can't imagine why I would\nhave thought he was dead. Clearly I have much\nleft to learn about the art of proper pessimism.\"",
      "\"Mr. Potter -\"",
      "\"At least tell me there's not really a prophecy...\" Professor\nMcGonagall was still giving him that bright, fixed smile. \"Oh, you\nhave got to be kidding me.\"",
      "\"Mr. Potter, you shouldn't go inventing things to worry about\n-\"",
      "\"Are you actually going to tell me that?\nImagine my reaction later, when I find out that there was something\nto worry about after all.\"",
      "Her fixed smile faltered.",
      "Harry's shoulders slumped. \"I have a whole world of magic to\nanalyse. I do not have time for this.\"",
      "Then both of them shut up, as a man in flowing orange robes\nappeared on the street and slowly passed them by; Professor\nMcGonagall's eyes tracked him, unobtrusively. Harry's mouth was\nmoving as he chewed hard on his lip, and someone watching closely\nwould have noticed a tiny spot of blood appear.",
      "When the orange-robed man had passed into the distance, Harry\nspoke again, in a low murmur. \"Are you going to tell me the truth\nnow, Professor McGonagall? And don't bother trying to wave it off,\nI'm not stupid.\"",
      "\"You're eleven years old, Mr. Potter!\" she said in a\nharsh whisper.",
      "\"And therefore subhuman. Sorry... for a moment there, I\nforgot.\"",
      "\"These are dreadful and important matters! They are\nsecret, Mr. Potter! It is a catastrophe that you,\nstill a child, know even this much! You must not tell\nanyone, do you understand? Absolutely no one!\"",
      "As sometimes happened when Harry got sufficiently\nangry, his blood went cold, instead of hot, and a terrible dark\nclarity descended over his mind, mapping out possible tactics and\nassessing their consequences with iron realism.",
      "Point out that you have a right to know: Failure.\nEleven-year-old children do not have rights to know anything, in\nMcGonagall's eyes.",
      "Say that you will not be friends any more: Failure. She does\nnot value your friendship sufficiently.",
      "Point out that you will be in danger if you do not know:\nFailure. Plans have already been made based on your ignorance.\nThe certain inconvenience of rethinking will seem far more\nunpalatable than the mere uncertain prospect of your\ncoming to harm.",
      "Justice and reason will both fail. You must either find\nsomething you have that she wants, or find something you can do\nwhich she fears...",
      "Ah.",
      "\"Well then, Professor,\" Harry said in a low, icy tone, \"it\nsounds like I have something you want. You can, if you like, tell\nme the truth, the whole truth, and in return I will keep\nyour secrets. Or you can try to keep me ignorant so you can use me\nas a pawn, in which case I will owe you nothing.\"",
      "McGonagall stopped short in the street. Her eyes blazed and her\nvoice descended into an outright hiss. \"How dare you!\"",
      "\"How dare you!\u202f\" he whispered back at her.",
      "\"You would blackmail me?\"",
      "Harry's lips twisted. \"I am offering you a\nfavor. I am giving you a chance to protect\nyour precious secret. If you refuse I will have\nevery natural motive to make inquiries elsewhere, not to\nspite you, but because I have to know! Get past your\npointless anger at a child who you think ought to obey\nyou, and you'll realise that any sane adult would do the same!\nLook at it from my perspective! How would you feel if it was\nYOU?\u202f\"",
      "Harry watched McGonagall, observed her harsh breathing. It\noccurred to him that it was time to ease off the pressure, let her\nsimmer for a while. \"You don't have to decide right away,\" Harry\nsaid in a more normal tone. \"I'll understand if you want time to\nthink about my offer... but I'll warn you of one thing,\"\nHarry said, his voice going colder. \"Don't try that Obliviation\nspell on me. Some time ago I worked out a signal, and I have\nalready sent that signal to myself. If I find that signal and I\ndon't remember sending it...\" Harry let his voice trail\noff significantly.",
      "McGonagall's face was working as her expressions shifted. \"I...\nwasn't thinking of Obliviating you, Mr. Potter... but why would you\nhave invented such a signal if you didn't know about\n-\"",
      "\"I thought of it while reading a Muggle science-fiction book,\nand said to myself, well, just in case... And no, I won't\ntell you the signal, I'm not dumb.\"",
      "\"I hadn't planned to ask,\" McGonagall said. She seemed to fold\nin on herself, and suddenly looked very old, and very tired. \"This\nhas been an exhausting day, Mr. Potter. Can we get your trunk, and\nsend you home? I will trust you not to speak upon this matter until\nI have had time to think. Keep in mind that there are only two\nother people in the whole world who know about this matter, and\nthey are Headmaster Albus Dumbledore and Professor Severus\nSnape.\"",
      "So. New information; that was a peace offering. Harry nodded in\nacceptance, and turned his head to look forward, and started\nwalking again, as his blood slowly began to warm over once\nmore.",
      "\"So now I've got to find some way to kill an immortal Dark\nWizard,\" Harry said, and sighed in frustration. \"I really wish you\nhad told me that before I started shopping.\"",
      "The trunk shop was more richly appointed than any other shop\nHarry had visited; the curtains were lush and delicately patterned,\nthe floor and walls of stained and polished wood, and the trunks\noccupied places of honor on polished ivory platforms. The salesman\nwas dressed in robes of finery only a cut below those of Lucius\nMalfoy, and spoke with exquisite, oily politeness to both Harry and\nProfessor McGonagall.",
      "Harry had asked his questions, and had gravitated to a trunk of\nheavy-looking wood, not polished but warm and solid, carved with\nthe pattern of a guardian dragon whose eyes shifted to look at\nanyone nearing it. A trunk charmed to be light, to shrink on\ncommand, to sprout small clawed tentacles from its bottom and\nsquirm after its owner. A trunk with two drawers on each of four\nsides that each slid out to reveal compartments as deep as the\nwhole trunk. A lid with four locks each of which would reveal a\ndifferent space inside. And - this was the important part - a\nhandle on the bottom which slid out a frame containing a staircase\nleading down into a small, lighted room that would hold, Harry\nestimated, around twelve bookcases.",
      "If they made luggages like this, Harry didn't know why anyone\nbothered owning a house.",
      "One hundred and eight golden Galleons. That was the price of a\ngood trunk, lightly used. At around fifty British pounds to the\nGalleon, that was enough to buy a second-hand car. It would be more\nexpensive than everything else Harry had ever bought in his whole\nlife all put together.",
      "Ninety-seven Galleons. That was how much was left in the bag of\ngold Harry had been allowed to take out of Gringotts.",
      "Professor McGonagall wore a look of chagrin upon her face. After\na long day's shopping she hadn't needed to ask Harry how much gold\nwas left in the bag, after the salesman quoted his price, which\nmeant the Professor could do good mental arithmetic without pen and\npaper. Once again, Harry reminded himself that scientifically\nilliterate was not at all the same thing as\nstupid.",
      "\"I'm sorry, young man,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"This is\nentirely my fault. I would offer to take you back to Gringotts, but\nthe bank will be closed for all but emergency services now.\"",
      "Harry looked at her, wondering...",
      "\"Well,\" sighed Professor McGonagall, as she swung on one heel,\n\"we may as well go, I suppose.\"",
      "...she hadn't lost it completely when a child had dared\ndefy her. She hadn't been happy, but she had thought\ninstead of exploding in fury. It might have just been that there\nwas an immortal Dark Lord to fight - that she had needed Harry's\ngoodwill. But most adults wouldn't have been capable of thinking\neven that much; wouldn't consider future consequences at\nall, if someone lower in status had refused to obey\nthem...",
      "\"Professor?\" Harry said.",
      "The witch turned back and looked at him.",
      "Harry took a deep breath. He needed to be a little angry for\nwhat he wanted to try now, there was no way he'd have the courage\nto do it otherwise. She didn't listen to me, he thought to\nhimself, I would have taken more gold but she didn't want to\nlisten... Focusing his entire world on McGonagall and the need\nto bend this conversation to his will, he spoke.",
      "\"Professor, you thought one hundred Galleons would be more than\nenough for a trunk. That's why you didn't bother warning me before\nit went down to ninety-seven. Which is just the sort of thing the\nresearch studies show - that's what happens when people think\nthey're leaving themselves a little error margin. They're\nnot pessimistic enough. If it'd been up to me, I'd have taken\ntwo hundred Galleons just to be sure. There was plenty of\nmoney in that vault, and I could have put back any extra later. But\nI thought you wouldn't let me do it. I thought you'd be angry at me\njust for asking. Was I wrong?\"",
      "\"I suppose I must confess that you are right,\" said Professor\nMcGonagall. \"But, young man -\"",
      "\"That sort of thing is the reason why I have trouble trusting\nadults.\" Somehow Harry kept his voice steady. \"Because they get\nangry if you even try to reason with them. To them it's\ndefiance and insolence and a challenge to their higher tribal\nstatus. If you try to talk to them they get angry. So if I\nhad anything really important to do, I wouldn't\nbe able to trust you. Even if you listened with deep concern to\nwhatever I said - because that's also part of the role of\nsomeone playing a concerned adult - you'd never change your\nactions, you wouldn't actually behave differently, because of\nanything I said.\"",
      "The salesman was watching them both with unabashed\nfascination.",
      "\"I can understand your point of view,\" Professor McGonagall said\neventually. \"If I sometimes seem too strict, please remember that I\nhave served as Head of Gryffindor House for what feels like several\nthousand years.\"",
      "Harry nodded and continued. \"So - suppose I had a way to get\nmore Galleons from my vault without us going back to\nGringotts, but it involved me violating the role of an obedient\nchild. Would I be able to trust you with that, even though you'd\nhave to step outside your own role as Professor McGonagall to take\nadvantage of it?\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" said Professor McGonagall.",
      "\"To put it another way, if I could make today have happened\ndifferently, so that we didn't take too little money with\nus, would that be all right even though it would involve a child\nbeing insolent to an adult in retrospect?\"",
      "\"I... suppose...\" the witch said, looking quite puzzled.",
      "Harry took out the mokeskin pouch, and said, \"Eleven Galleons\noriginally from my family vault.\"",
      "And there was gold in Harry's hand.",
      "For a moment Professor McGonagall's mouth gaped wide, then her\njaw snapped shut and her eyes narrowed and the witch bit out,\n\"Where did you get that -\"",
      "\"From my family vault, like I said.\"",
      "\"How?\u202f\"",
      "\"Magic.\"",
      "\"That's hardly an answer!\" snapped Professor McGonagall, and\nthen stopped, blinking.",
      "\"No, it isn't, is it? I ought to claim that it's\nbecause I experimentally discovered the true secrets of how the\npouch works and that it can actually retrieve objects from\nanywhere, not just its own inside, if you phrase the request\ncorrectly. But actually it's from when I fell into that pile of\ngold before and I shoved some Galleons into my pocket. Anyone who\nunderstands pessimism knows that money is something you might need\nquickly and without much warning. So now are you angry at me for\ndefying your authority? Or glad that we succeeded in our important\nmission?\"",
      "The salesman's eyes were wide like saucers.",
      "And the tall witch stood there, silent.",
      "\"Discipline at Hogwarts must be enforced,\" she said\nafter almost a full minute. \"For the sake of all the\nstudents. And that must include courtesy and obedience\nfrom you to all professors.\"",
      "\"I understand, Professor McGonagall.\"",
      "\"Good. Now let us buy that trunk and go home.\"",
      "Harry felt like throwing up, or cheering, or fainting, or\nsomething. That was the first time his careful reasoning\nhad ever worked on anyone. Maybe because it was also the\nfirst time he had something really serious that an adult needed\nfrom him, but still -",
      "Minerva McGonagall, +1 point.",
      "Harry bowed, and gave the bag of gold and the extra eleven\nGalleons into McGonagall's hands. \"Thank you very much, Professor.\nCan you finish up the purchase for me? I've got to visit the\nlavatory.\"",
      "The salesman, unctuous once more, pointed toward a door set into\nthe wall with a gold-handled knob. As Harry started to walk away,\nhe heard the salesman ask in his oily voice, \"May I inquire as to\nwho that was, Madam McGonagall? I take it he is Slytherin -\nthird-year, perhaps? - and from a prominent family, but I did not\nrecognise -\"",
      "The slam of the lavatory door cut off his words, and after Harry\nhad identified the lock and pressed it into place, he grabbed the\nmagical self-cleaning towel and, with shaky hands, wiped moisture\noff his forehead. Harry's entire body was sheathed in sweat which\nhad soaked clear through his Muggle clothing, though at least it\ndidn't show through the robes.",
      "The sun was setting and it was very late indeed, by the time\nthey stood again in the courtyard of the Leaky Cauldron, the silent\nleaf-dusted interface between magical Britain's Diagon Alley and\nthe entire Muggle world. (That was one awfully decoupled\neconomy...) Harry was to go to a phone box and call his father,\nonce he was on the other side. He didn't need to worry about his\nluggage being stolen, apparently. His trunk had the status of a\nmajor magical item, something that most Muggles wouldn't notice;\nthat was part of what you could get in the wizarding world, if you\nwere willing to pay the price of a secondhand car.",
      "\"So here we part ways, for a time,\" Professor McGonagall said.\nShe shook her head in wonderment. \"This has been the strangest day\nof my life for... many a year. Since the day I learned that a child\nhad defeated You-Know-Who. I wonder now, looking back, if that was\nthe last reasonable day of the world.\"",
      "Oh, like she had anything to complain about. You\nthink your day was surreal? Try mine.",
      "\"I was very impressed with you today,\" Harry said to her. \"I\nshould have remembered to compliment you out loud, I was awarding\nyou points in my head and everything.\"",
      "\"Thank you, Mr. Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"If you had\nalready been sorted into a House I would have deducted so many\npoints that your grandchildren would still be losing the House\nCup.\"",
      "\"Thank you, Professor.\" It was probably too early to\ncall her Minnie.",
      "This woman might well be the sanest adult Harry had ever met,\ndespite her lack of scientific background. Harry was even\nconsidering offering her the number-two position in whatever group\nhe formed to fight the Dark Lord, though he wasn't silly enough to\nsay that out loud. Now what would be a good name for that...?\nThe Death Eater Eaters?",
      "\"I'll see you again soon, when school starts,\" Professor\nMcGonagall said. \"And, Mr. Potter, about your wand -\"",
      "\"I know what you're going to ask,\" Harry said. He took out his\nprecious wand and, with a deep twinge of inner pain, flipped it\nover in his hand, presenting her with the handle. \"Take it. I\nhadn't planned to do anything, not a single thing, but I don't want\nyou to have nightmares about me blowing up my house.\"",
      "Professor McGonagall shook her head rapidly. \"Oh no, Mr. Potter!\nThat isn't done. I only meant to warn you not to use your\nwand at home, since the Ministry can detect underage magic and it\nis prohibited without supervision.\"",
      "\"Ah,\" Harry said. \"That sounds like a very sensible rule. I'm\nglad to see the wizarding world takes that sort of thing\nseriously.\"",
      "Professor McGonagall peered hard at him. \"You really mean\nthat.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry said. \"I get it. Magic is dangerous and the rules\nare there for good reasons. Certain other matters are also\ndangerous. I get that too. Remember that I am not stupid.\"",
      "\"I am unlikely ever to forget it. Thank you, Harry, that does\nmake me feel better about entrusting you with certain things.\nGoodbye for now.\"",
      "Harry turned to go, into the Leaky Cauldron and out towards the\nMuggle world.",
      "As his hand touched the back door's handle, he heard a last\nwhisper from behind him.",
      "\"Hermione Granger.\"",
      "\"What?\" Harry said, his hand still on the door.",
      "\"Look for a first-year girl named Hermione Granger on the train\nto Hogwarts.\"",
      "\"Who is she?\"",
      "There was no answer, and when Harry turned around, Professor\nMcGonagall was gone.",
      "Aftermath:",
      "Headmaster Albus Dumbledore leaned forward over his desk. His\ntwinkling eyes peered out at Minerva. \"So, my dear, how did you\nfind Harry?\"",
      "Minerva opened her mouth. Then she closed her mouth. Then she\nopened her mouth again. No words came out.",
      "\"I see,\" Albus said gravely. \"Thank you for your report,\nMinerva. You may go.\""

      "\"Your dad is almost as awesome as my dad.\"",
      "Petunia Evans-Verres's lips were trembling and her eyes were\ntearing up as Harry hugged her midsection on Platform Nine of the\nKing's Cross Station. \"Are you sure you don't want me to come with\nyou, Harry?\"",
      "Harry glanced over to his father Michael Verres-Evans, who was\nlooking stereotypically stern-but-proud, and then back to his\nmother, who really did look rather... uncomposed. \"Mum, I know you\ndon't like the wizarding world very much. You don't have to come\nwith. I mean it.\"",
      "Petunia winced. \"Harry, you shouldn't worry about me, I'm your\nmother and if you need someone with you -\"",
      "\"Mum, I'm going to be on my own at Hogwarts for months\nand months. If I can't manage a train platform alone,\nbetter to find out sooner rather than later so we can abort.\" He\nlowered his voice to a whisper. \"Besides, Mum, they all love me\nover there. If I have any problems, all I need to do is take off my\nsweatband,\" Harry tapped the exercise band covering his scar, \"and\nI'll have way more help than I can handle.\"",
      "\"Oh, Harry,\" Petunia whispered. She knelt down and hugged him\nhard, face to face, their cheeks resting against each other. Harry\ncould feel her ragged breathing, and then he heard a muffled sob\nescape. \"Oh, Harry, I do love you, always remember that.\"",
      "It's like she's afraid she'll never see me again, the\nthought popped into Harry's head. He knew the thought was true but\nhe didn't know why Mum was so afraid.",
      "So he made a guess. \"Mum, you know that I'm not going to turn\ninto your sister just because I'm learning magic, right? I'll do\nany magic you ask for - if I can, I mean - or if you want me\nnot to use any magic around the house, I'll do that too, I\npromise I'll never let magic come between us -\"",
      "A tight hug cut off his words. \"You have a good heart,\" his\nmother whispered into his ear. \"A very good heart, my son.\"",
      "Harry choked up himself a little, then.",
      "His mother released him, and stood up. She took a handkerchief\nout of her handbag, and with a trembling hand dabbed at the running\nmakeup around her eyes.",
      "There were no questions about his father accompanying him to the\nmagical side of King's Cross Station. Dad had trouble just looking\nat Harry's trunk directly. Magic ran in families, and Michael\nVerres-Evans couldn't even walk.",
      "So instead his father just cleared his throat. \"Good luck at\nschool, Harry,\" he said. \"Do you think I bought you enough\nbooks?\"",
      "Harry had explained to his father about how he thought this\nmight be his big chance to do something really revolutionary and\nimportant, and Professor Verres-Evans had nodded and dumped his\nextremely busy schedule for two solid days in order to go on the\nGreatest Secondhand Bookshop Raid Ever, which had covered four\ncities and produced thirty boxes of science books now\nsitting in the cavern level of Harry's trunk. Most of the books had\ngone for a pound or two, but some of them definitely\nhadn't, like the very latest Handbook of Chemistry and\nPhysics or the complete 1972 set of the Encyclopaedia\nBritannica. His father had tried to block Harry off from\nseeing the till displays but Harry figured his father must have\nspent at least a thousand pounds. Harry had said to his\nfather that he would pay him back as soon as he figured out how to\nconvert wizarding gold into Muggle money, and his father had told\nhim to go jump in a lake.",
      "And then his father had asked him: Do you think I bought you\nenough books? It was quite clear what answer Dad wanted to\nhear.",
      "Harry's throat was hoarse, for some reason. \"You can never have\nenough books,\" he recited the Verres family motto, and his father\nknelt down and gave him a quick, firm embrace. \"But you\ncertainly tried,\" Harry said, and felt himself choking up\nagain. \"It was a really, really, really good try.\"",
      "His Dad straightened. \"So...\" he said. \"Do you see a\nPlatform Nine and Three-Quarters?\"",
      "King's Cross Station was huge and busy, with walls and floors\npaved with ordinary dirt-stained tiles. It was full of ordinary\npeople hurrying about their ordinary business, having ordinary\nconversations which generated lots and lots of ordinary noise.\nKing's Cross Station had a Platform Nine (which they were standing\non) and a Platform Ten (right nearby) but there was nothing between\nPlatform Nine and Platform Ten except a thin, unpromising barrier\nwall. A great skylight overhead let in plenty of light to\nilluminate the total lack whatsoever of any Platform Nine and\nThree-Quarters.",
      "Harry stared around until his eyes watered, thinking, come\non, mage-sight, come on, mage-sight, but absolutely nothing\nappeared to him. He thought about taking out his wand and waving\nit, but Professor McGonagall had warned him against using his wand.\nPlus if there was another shower of multicoloured sparks that might\nlead to being arrested for setting off fireworks inside a train\nstation. And that was assuming his wand didn't decide to do\nsomething else, like blowing up all of King's Cross. Harry had only\nlightly skimmed his schoolbooks (though that skim was quite bizarre\nenough) in a very quick effort to determine what sort of science\nbooks to buy over the next 48 hours.",
      "Well, he had - Harry glanced at his watch - one whole hour to\nfigure it out, since he was supposed to be on the train at eleven.\nMaybe this was the equivalent of an IQ test and the stupid kids\ncouldn't become wizards. (And the amount of extra time you gave\nyourself would determine your Conscientiousness, which was the\nsecond most important factor in scholarly success.)",
      "\"I'll figure it out,\" Harry said to his waiting parents. \"It's\nprobably some sort of test thingy.\"",
      "His father frowned. \"Hm... maybe look for a trail of mixed\nfootprints on the ground, leading somewhere that doesn't seem to\nmake sense -\"",
      "\"Dad!\u202f\" Harry said. \"Stop that! I haven't even\ntried to figure it out on my own!\" It was a very good\nsuggestion, too, which was worse.",
      "\"Sorry,\" his father apologised.",
      "\"Ah...\" Harry's mother said. \"I don't think they would do that\nto a student, do you? Are you sure Professor McGonagall didn't tell\nyou anything?\"",
      "\"Maybe she was distracted,\" Harry said without thinking.",
      "\"Harry!\u202f\" hissed his father and mother in unison.\n\"What did you do?\u202f\"",
      "\"I, um -\" Harry swallowed. \"Look, we don't have time for this\nnow -\"",
      "\"Harry!\u202f\"",
      "\"I mean it! We don't have time for this now! Because it's a\nreally long story and I've got to figure out how to get to\nschool!\"",
      "His mother had a hand over her face. \"How bad was it?\"",
      "\"I, ah,\" I can't talk about that for reasons of National\nSecurity, \"about half as bad as the Incident with the Science\nProject?\"",
      "\"Harry!\u202f\"",
      "\"I, er, oh look there are some people with an owl I'll go ask\nthem how to get in!\" and Harry ran away from his parents towards\nthe family of fiery redheads, his trunk automatically slithering\nbehind him.",
      "The plump woman looked to him as he arrived. \"Hello, dear. First\ntime at Hogwarts? Ron's new, too -\" and then she peered closely at\nhim. \"Harry Potter?\u202f\"",
      "Four boys and a red-headed girl and an owl all swung around and\nthen froze in place.",
      "\"Oh, come on!\u202f\" Harry protested. He'd been planning to\ngo as Harry Verres at least until he got to Hogwarts. \"I bought a\nsweatband and everything! How come you know who I am?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry's father said, coming up behind him with long easy\nstrides, \"how do you know who he is?\" His voice indicated\na certain dread.",
      "\"Your picture was in the newspapers,\" said one of two\nidentical-looking twins.",
      "\"HARRY!\u202f\"",
      "\"Dad! It's not like that! It's 'cause I defeated the\nDark Lord You-Know-Who when I was one year old!\"",
      "\"WHAT?\u202f\"",
      "\"Mum can explain.\"",
      "\"WHAT?\u202f\"",
      "\"Ah... Michael dear, there are certain things I thought it would\nbe best not to bother you with until now -\"",
      "\"Excuse me,\" Harry said to the redheaded family who were all\nstaring at him, \"but it would be quite extremely helpful if you\ncould tell me how to get to Platform Nine and Three Quarters\nright now.\"",
      "\"Ah...\" said the woman. She raised a hand and pointed at the\nwall between platforms. \"Just walk straight at the barrier between\nplatforms nine and ten. Don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash\ninto it, that's very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if\nyou're nervous.\"",
      "\"And whatever you do, don't think of an elephant.\"",
      "\"George! Ignore him, Harry dear, there's no reason not\nto think of an elephant.\"",
      "\"I'm Fred, Mum, not George -\"",
      "\"Thanks!\" Harry said and took off at a run towards the barrier\n-",
      "Wait a minute, it wouldn't work unless he believed in\nit?",
      "It was at times like this that Harry hated his mind for actually\nworking fast enough to realise that this was a case where \"resonant\ndoubt\" applied, that is, if he'd started out thinking that he would\ngo through the barrier he'd have been fine, only now he was worried\nabout whether he sufficiently believed he'd go through the\nbarrier, which meant that he actually was worried about\ncrashing into it -",
      "\"Harry! Get back here, you have some explaining to\ndo!\u202f\" That was his Dad.",
      "Harry shut his eyes and ignored everything he knew about\njustified credibility and just tried to believe really\nhard that he'd go through the barrier and -",
      "- the sounds around him changed.",
      "Harry opened his eyes and stumbled to a halt, feeling vaguely\ndirtied by having made a deliberate effort to believe\nsomething.",
      "He was standing in a bright, open-air platform next to a single\nhuge train, fourteen long carriages headed up by a massive\nscarlet-metal steam engine with a tall chimney that promised death\nto air quality. The platform was already lightly crowded (even\nthough Harry was a full hour early); dozens of children and their\nparents swarmed around benches, tables, and various hawkers and\nstalls.",
      "It went entirely without saying that there was no such place in\nKing's Cross Station and no room to hide it.",
      "Okay, so either (a) I just teleported somewhere else\nentirely (b) they can fold space like no one's business or (c) they\nare simply ignoring all the rules.",
      "There was a slithering sound behind him, and Harry turned around\nto observe that his trunk had indeed followed him on its small\nclawed tentacles. Apparently, for magical purposes, his luggage had\nalso managed to believe with sufficient strength to pass through\nthe barrier. That was actually a little disturbing when Harry\nstarted thinking about it.",
      "A moment later, the youngest-looking red-haired boy came through\nthe iron archway (iron archway?) at a run, pulling his trunk behind\nhim on a lead and nearly crashing into Harry. Harry, feeling stupid\nfor having stayed around, quickly began moving away from the\nlanding area, and the red-haired boy followed him, yanking hard on\nhis trunk's lead in order to keep up. A moment later, a white owl\nfluttered through the archway and came to rest on the boy's\nshoulder.",
      "\"Cor,\" said the red-haired boy, \"are you really Harry\nPotter?\"",
      "Not this again. \"I have no logical way of knowing that\nfor certain. My parents raised me to believe that my name\nwas Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, and many people here have told\nme that I look like my parents, I mean my other parents,\nbut,\" Harry frowned, realising, \"for all I know, there\ncould easily be spells to polymorph a child into a specified\nappearance -\"",
      "\"Er, what, mate?\"",
      "Not headed for Ravenclaw, I take it. \"Yes, I'm Harry\nPotter.\"",
      "\"I'm Ron Weasley,\" said the tall skinny freckled long-nosed kid,\nand stuck out a hand, which Harry politely shook as they walked.\nThe owl gave Harry an oddly measured and courteous hoot (actually\nmore of an eehhhhh sound, which surprised Harry).",
      "At this point Harry realised the potential for imminent\ncatastrophe. \"Just a second,\" he said to Ron, and opened one of the\ndrawers of his trunk, the one that if he recalled correctly was for\nWinter Clothes - it was - and then he found the lightest scarf he\nowned, underneath his winter coat. Harry took off his sweatband,\nand just as quickly unfolded the scarf and tied it around his face.\nIt was a little hot, especially in the summer, but Harry could live\nwith that.",
      "Then he shut that drawer and pulled out another drawer and drew\nforth black wizarding robes, which he shrugged over his head, now\nthat he was out of Muggle territory.",
      "\"There,\" Harry said. The sound came out slightly muffled through\nthe scarf over his face. He turned to Ron. \"How do I look? Stupid,\nI know, but am I identifiable as Harry Potter?\"",
      "\"Er,\" Ron said. He closed his mouth, which had been open. \"Not\nreally, Harry.\"",
      "\"Very good,\" Harry said. \"However, so as not to obviate the\npoint of the whole exercise, you will henceforth address me as,\"\nVerres might not work anymore, \"Mr. Spoo.\"",
      "\"Okay, Harry,\" Ron said uncertainly.",
      "The Force is not particularly strong in this one.\n\"Call... me... Mister... Spoo.\"",
      "\"Okay, Mister Spoo -\" Ron stopped. \"I can't do that, it makes me\nfeel stupid.\"",
      "That's not just a feeling. \"Okay. You pick a\nname.\"",
      "\"Mr. Cannon,\" Ron said at once. \"For the Chudley Cannons.\"",
      "\"Ah...\" Harry knew he was going to terribly regret asking this.\n\"Who or what are the Chudley Cannons?\"",
      "\"Who're the Chudley Cannons? Only the most brilliant\nteam in the whole history of Quidditch! Sure, they finished at the\nbottom of the league last year, but -\"",
      "\"What's Quidditch?\"",
      "Asking this was also a mistake.",
      "\"So let me get this straight,\" Harry said as it seemed that\nRon's explanation (with associated hand gestures) was winding down.\n\"Catching the Snitch is worth one hundred and fifty\npoints?\u202f\"",
      "\"Yeah -\"",
      "\"How many ten-point goals does one side usually score\nnot counting the Snitch?\"",
      "\"Um, maybe fifteen or twenty in professional games -\"",
      "\"That's just wrong. That violates every possible rule of game\ndesign. Look, the rest of this game sounds like it might make\nsense, sort of, for a sport I mean, but you're basically saying\nthat catching the Snitch overwhelms almost any ordinary point\nspread. The two Seekers are up there flying around looking for the\nSnitch and usually not interacting with anyone else, spotting the\nSnitch first is going to be mostly luck -\"",
      "\"It's not luck!\" protested Ron. \"You've got to keep your eyes\nmoving in the right pattern -\"",
      "\"That's not interactive, there's no back-and-forth with\nthe other player and how much fun is it to watch someone incredibly\ngood at moving their eyes? And then whichever Seeker gets lucky\nswoops in and grabs the Snitch and makes everyone else's work moot.\nIt's like someone took a real game and grafted on this pointless\nextra position so that you could be the Most Important Player\nwithout needing to really get involved or learn the rest of it. Who\nwas the first Seeker, the King's idiot son who wanted to play\nQuidditch but couldn't understand the rules?\" Actually, now that\nHarry thought about it, that seemed like a surprisingly good\nhypothesis. Put him on a broomstick and tell him to catch the shiny\nthing...",
      "Ron's face pulled into a scowl. \"If you don't like Quidditch,\nyou don't have to make fun of it!\"",
      "\"If you can't criticise, you can't optimise. I'm suggesting how\nto improve the game. And it's very simple. Get rid of the\nSnitch.\"",
      "\"They won't change the game just 'cause you say\nso!\"",
      "\"I am the Boy-Who-Lived, you know. People will listen\nto me. And maybe if I can persuade them to change the game at\nHogwarts, the innovation will spread.\"",
      "A look of absolute horror was spreading over Ron's face. \"But,\nbut if you get rid of the Snitch, how will anyone know when the\ngame ends?\"",
      "\"Buy... a... clock. It would be a lot fairer than\nhaving the game sometimes end after ten minutes and sometimes not\nend for hours, and the schedule would be a lot more predictable for\nthe spectators, too.\" Harry sighed. \"Oh, stop giving me that look\nof absolute horror, I probably won't actually take the\ntime to destroy this pathetic excuse for a national sport and\nremake it stronger and smarter in my own image. I've got way, way,\nway more important stuff to worry about.\" Harry looked\nthoughtful. \"Then again, it wouldn't take much time to\nwrite up the Ninety-Five Theses of the Snitchless Reformation and\nnail it to a church door -\"",
      "\"Potter,\" drawled a young boy's voice, \"what is that on\nyour face and what is standing next to you?\"",
      "Ron's look of horror was replaced by utter hatred.\n\"You!\u202f\"",
      "Harry turned his head; and indeed it was Draco Malfoy, who might\nhave been forced to wear standard school robes, but was making up\nfor that with a trunk looking at least as magical and far more\nelegant than Harry's own, decorated in silver and emeralds and\nbearing what Harry guessed to be the Malfoy family crest, a\nbeautiful fanged serpent over crossed ivory wands.",
      "\"Draco!\" Harry said. \"Er, or Malfoy if you prefer, though that\nkind of sounds like Lucius to me. I'm glad to see you're doing so\nwell after, um, our last meeting. This is Ron Weasley. And I'm\ntrying to go incognito, so call me, eh,\" Harry looked down at his\nrobes, \"Mister Black.\"",
      "\"Harry!\u202f\" hissed Ron. \"You can't use that\nname!\"",
      "Harry blinked. \"Why not?\" It sounded nicely dark, like\nan international man of mystery -",
      "\"I'd say it's a fine name,\" said Draco, \"but it belongs\nto the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. I'll call you Mr.\nSilver.\"",
      "\"You get away from... from Mr. Gold,\" Ron said coldly,\nand took a forward step. \"He doesn't need to talk to the likes of\nyou!\"",
      "Harry raised a placating hand. \"I'll go by Mr. Bronze, thanks\nfor the naming schema. And, Ron, um,\" Harry struggled to find a way\nto say this, \"I'm glad you're so... enthusiastic about protecting\nme, but I don't particularly mind talking to Draco -\"",
      "This was apparently the last straw for Ron, who spun on Harry\nwith eyes now aflame with outrage. \"What? Do you\nknow who this is?\"",
      "\"Yes, Ron,\" Harry said, \"you may remember that I called him\nDraco without him needing to introduce himself.\"",
      "Draco sniggered. Then his eyes lit on the white owl on Ron's\nshoulder. \"Oh, what's this?\u202f\" Draco said in a drawl rich\nwith malice. \"Where's the famous Weasley family rat?\"",
      "\"Buried in the backyard,\" Ron said coldly.",
      "\"Aw, how sad. Pot... ah, Mr. Bronze, I should mention that the\nWeasley family is widely agreed to have the best pet story\never. Want to tell it, Weasley?\"",
      "Ron's face contorted. \"You wouldn't think it was funny if it\nhappened to your family!\"",
      "\"Oh,\" Draco purred, \"but it wouldn't ever happen to the\nMalfoys.\"",
      "Ron's hands clenched into fists -",
      "\"That's enough,\" Harry said, putting as much quiet authority\ninto the voice as he could manage. It was clear that whatever this\nwas about, it was a painful memory for the red-haired kid. \"If Ron\ndoesn't want to talk about it, he doesn't have to talk about it,\nand I'd ask that you not talk about it either.\"",
      "Draco turned a surprised look on Harry, and Ron nodded. \"That's\nright, Harry! I mean Mr. Bronze! You see what kind of person he is?\nNow tell him to go away!\"",
      "Harry counted to ten inside his head, which for him was a very\nquick 12345678910 - an odd habit left over from the age of\nfive when his mother had first instructed him to do it, and Harry\nhad reasoned that his way was faster and ought to be just as\neffective. \"I'm not telling him to go away,\" Harry said calmly.\n\"He's welcome to talk to me if he wants.\"",
      "\"Well, I don't intend to hang around with anyone who hangs\naround with Draco Malfoy,\" Ron announced coldly.",
      "Harry shrugged. \"That's up to you. I don't intend to\nlet anyone say who I can and can't hang around with.\" Silently\nchanting, please go away, please go away...",
      "Ron's face went blank with surprise, like he'd actually expected\nthat line to work. Then Ron spun about, yanked his luggage's lead\nand stormed off down the platform.",
      "\"If you didn't like him,\" Draco said curiously, \"why didn't you\njust walk away?\"",
      "\"Um... his mother helped me figure out how to get to this\nplatform from the King's Cross Station, so it was kind of hard to\ntell him to get lost. And it's not that I hate this Ron\nguy,\" Harry said, \"I just, just...\" Harry searched for words.",
      "\"Don't see any reason for him to exist?\" offered Draco.",
      "\"Pretty much.\"",
      "\"Anyway, Potter... if you really were raised by Muggles -\" Draco\npaused here, as if waiting for a denial, but Harry didn't say\nanything \"- then you mightn't know what it's like to be famous.\nPeople want to take up all of our time. You have\nto learn to say no.\"",
      "Harry nodded, putting a thoughtful look on his face. \"That\nsounds like good advice.\"",
      "\"If you try to be nice, you just end up spending the most time\nwith the pushiest ones. Decide who you want to spend time\nwith and make everyone else leave. You're just getting here,\nPotter, so everyone's going to judge you by who they see you with,\nand you don't want to be seen with the likes of Ron Weasley.\"",
      "Harry nodded again. \"If you don't mind my asking, how did you\nrecognise me?\"",
      "\"Mister Bronze,\" Draco drawled, \"I have met\nyou, remember. I saw someone going around with a scarf wrapped\naround his head, looking absolutely ridiculous. So I took a\nguess.\"",
      "Harry bowed his head, accepting the compliment. \"I'm\nterribly sorry about that,\" Harry said. \"Our first\nmeeting, I mean. I didn't mean to embarrass you in front of\nLucius.\"",
      "Draco waved it off while giving Harry an odd look. \"I just wish\nFather could have come in while you were flattering\nme -\" Draco laughed. \"But thank you for what you\nsaid to Father. If not for that, I might've had a harder time\nexplaining.\"",
      "Harry swept a deeper bow. \"And thank you for\nreciprocating with what you said to Professor McGonagall.\"",
      "\"You're welcome. Though one of the assistants must've sworn her\nclosest friend to absolute secrecy, because Father says there're\nweird rumors going around, like you and I got in a fight\nor something.\"",
      "\"Ouch,\" Harry said, wincing. \"I'm really sorry -\"",
      "\"No, we're used to it, Merlin knows there's lots of rumors about\nthe Malfoy family already.\"",
      "Harry nodded. \"I'm glad to hear you're not in trouble.\"",
      "Draco smirked. \"Father has, um, a refined sense of\nhumor, but he does understand making friends. He\nunderstands it very well. He made me repeat that before I\nwent to bed every night for the last month, 'I will make friends at\nHogwarts.' When I explained everything to him and he saw that's\nwhat I was doing, he bought me an ice-cream.\"",
      "Harry's jaw dropped. \"You managed to spin that into an\nice-cream?\u202f\"",
      "Draco nodded, looking every bit as smug as the feat deserved.\n\"Well, father knew what I was doing, of course, but he's\nthe one who taught me how to do it, and if I grin the\nright way while I'm doing it, that makes it a father-son\nthing and then he has to buy me an ice-cream or I'll give\nhim this sort of sad look, like I think I must have disappointed\nhim.\"",
      "Harry eyed Draco calculatingly, sensing the presence of another\nmaster. \"You've had lessons on how to manipulate\npeople?\"",
      "\"Of course,\" Draco said proudly. \"I'm a Malfoy. Father\nbought me tutors.\"",
      "\"Wow,\" Harry said. Reading Robert Cialdini's Influence:\nScience and Practice probably didn't stack up very high\ncompared to that (though it was still one heck of a book). \"Your\ndad is almost as awesome as my dad.\"",
      "Draco's eyebrows rose loftily. \"Oh? And what does your\nfather do?\"",
      "\"He buys me books.\"",
      "Draco considered this. \"That doesn't sound very impressive.\"",
      "\"You had to be there. Anyway, I'm glad to hear all that. The way\nLucius was looking at you, I thought he was going to c-crucify\nyou.\"",
      "\"My father really loves me,\" Draco said firmly. \"He wouldn't\never do that.\"",
      "\"Um...\" Harry said. He remembered the black-robed, white-haired\nfigure of elegance that had stormed through Madam Malkin's,\nwielding that beautiful, deadly silver-handled cane. It wasn't easy\nto visualise him as a doting father. \"Don't take this the wrong\nway, but how do you know that?\"",
      "\"Huh?\" It was clear that this was a question Draco did not\ncommonly ask himself.",
      "\"I ask the fundamental question of rationality: Why do you\nbelieve what you believe? What do you think you know and how do you\nthink you know it? What makes you think Lucius wouldn't sacrifice\nyou the same way he'd sacrifice anything else for power?\"",
      "Draco shot Harry another odd look. \"Just what do you\nknow about Father?\"",
      "\"Um... seat on the Wizengamot, seat on Hogwarts' Board of\nGovernors, incredibly wealthy, has the ear of Minister Fudge, has\nthe confidence of Minister Fudge, probably has some highly\nembarrassing photos of Minister Fudge, most prominent blood purist\nnow that the Dark Lord's gone, former Death Eater who was found to\nhave the Dark Mark but got off by claiming to be under the Imperius\nCurse, which was ridiculously implausible and pretty much everyone\nknew it... evil with a capital 'E' and a born killer... I think\nthat's it.\"",
      "Draco's eyes had narrowed to slits. \"McGonagall told you that,\ndid she.\"",
      "\"No, she wouldn't say anything to me about Lucius\nafterwards, except to stay away from him. So during the Incident at\nthe Potions Shop, while Professor McGonagall was busy yelling at\nthe shopkeeper and trying to get everything under control, I\ngrabbed one of the customers and asked them about\nLucius.\"",
      "Draco's eyes were wide again. \"Did you really?\u202f\"",
      "Harry gave Draco a puzzled look. \"If I lied the first time, I'm\nnot going to tell you the truth just because you ask twice.\"",
      "There was a certain pause as Draco absorbed this.",
      "\"You're so completely going to be in Slytherin.\"",
      "\"I'm so completely going to be in Ravenclaw, thank you very\nmuch. I only want power so I can get books.\"",
      "Draco giggled. \"Yeah, right. Anyway... to answer what you\nasked...\" Draco took a deep breath, and his face turned serious.\n\"Father once missed a Wizengamot vote for me. I was on a broom and\nI fell off and broke a lot of ribs. It really hurt. I'd never hurt\nthat much before and I thought I was going to die. So Father missed\nthis really important vote, because he was there by my bed at St.\nMungo's, holding my hands and promising me that I was going to be\nokay.\"",
      "Harry glanced away uncomfortably, then, with an effort, forced\nhimself to look back at Draco. \"Why are you telling me\nthat? It seems sort of... private...\"",
      "Draco gave Harry a serious look. \"One of my tutors once said\nthat people form close friendships by knowing private things about\neach other, and the reason most people don't make close friends is\nbecause they're too embarrassed to share anything really important\nabout themselves.\" Draco turned his palms out invitingly. \"Your\nturn?\"",
      "Knowing that Draco's hopeful face had probably been drilled into\nhim by months of practice did not make it any less effective, Harry\nobserved. Actually it did make it less effective,\nbut unfortunately not ineffective. The same could be said\nof Draco's clever use of reciprocation pressure for an unsolicited\ngift, a technique which Harry had read about in his social\npsychology books (one experiment had shown that an unconditional\ngift of $5 was twice as effective as a conditional offer of $50 in\ngetting people to fill out surveys). Draco had made an unsolicited\ngift of a confidence, and now invited Harry to offer a confidence\nin return... and the thing was, Harry did feel pressured.\nRefusal, Harry was certain, would be met with a look of sad\ndisappointment, and maybe a small amount of contempt indicating\nthat Harry had lost points.",
      "\"Draco,\" Harry said, \"just so you know, I recognise exactly what\nyou're doing right now. My own books called it\nreciprocation and they talk about how giving someone a\nstraight gift of two Sickles was found to be twice as effective as\noffering them twenty Sickles in getting them to do what you\nwant...\" Harry trailed off.",
      "Draco was looking sad and disappointed. \"It's not meant as a\ntrick, Harry. It's a real way of becoming friends.\"",
      "Harry held up a hand. \"I didn't say I wasn't going to respond. I\njust need time to pick something that's private but just as\nnon-damaging. Let's say... I wanted you to know that I can't be\nrushed into things.\" A pause to reflect could go a long way in\ndefusing the power of a lot of compliance techniques, once you\nlearned to recognise them for what they were.",
      "\"All right,\" Draco said. \"I'll wait while you come up with\nsomething. Oh, and please take off the scarf while you say it.\"",
      "Simple but effective.",
      "And Harry couldn't help but notice how clumsy, awkward,\ngraceless his attempt at resisting manipulation / saving face /\nshowing off had appeared compared to Draco. I need those\ntutors.",
      "\"All right,\" Harry said after a time. \"Here's mine.\" He glanced\naround and then rolled the scarf back up over his face, exposing\neverything but the scar. \"Um... it sounds like you can really rely\non your father. I mean... if you talk to him seriously, he'll\nalways listen to you and take you seriously.\"",
      "Draco nodded.",
      "\"Sometimes,\" Harry said, and swallowed. This was surprisingly\nhard, but then it was meant to be. \"Sometimes I wish my own Dad was\nlike yours.\" Harry's eyes flinched away from Draco's face, more or\nless automatically, and then Harry forced himself to look back at\nDraco.",
      "Then it hit Harry what on Earth he'd just said, and\nHarry hastily added, \"Not that I wish my Dad was a flawless\ninstrument of death like Lucius, I only mean taking me seriously\n-\"",
      "\"I understand,\" Draco said with a smile. \"There... now doesn't\nit feel like we're a little closer to being friends?\"",
      "Harry nodded. \"Yeah. It does, actually. Um... no offence, but\nI'm going to put on my disguise again, I really don't want\nto deal with -\"",
      "\"I understand.\"",
      "Harry rolled the scarf back down over his face.",
      "\"My father takes all his friends seriously,\" Draco said. \"That's\nwhy he has lots of friends. You should meet him.\"",
      "\"I'll think about it,\" Harry said in a neutral voice. He shook\nhis head in wonder. \"So you really are his one weak point.\nHuh.\"",
      "Now Draco was giving Harry a really odd look. \"You want\nto go get something to drink and find somewhere to sit down?\"",
      "Harry realised he had been standing in one place for too long,\nand stretched himself, trying to crick his back. \"Sure.\"",
      "The platform was starting to fill up now, but there was still a\nquieter area on the far side away from the red steam engine. Along\nthe way they passed a stall containing a bald, bearded man offering\nnewspapers and comic books and stacked neon-green cans.",
      "The stallholder was, in fact, leaning back and drinking out of\none of the neon-green cans at the exact point when he spotted the\nrefined and elegant Draco Malfoy approaching along with a\nmysterious boy looking incredibly stupid with a scarf tied over his\nface, causing the stallholder to experience a sudden coughing fit\nin mid-drink and dribble a large amount of neon-green liquid onto\nhis beard.",
      "\"'Scuse me,\" Harry said, \"but what is that stuff,\nexactly?\"",
      "\"Comed-Tea,\" said the stallholder. \"If you drink it, something\nsurprising is bound to happen which makes you spill it on yourself\nor someone else. But it's charmed to vanish just a few seconds\nlater -\" Indeed the stain on his beard was already\ndisappearing.",
      "\"How droll,\" said Draco. \"How very, very droll. Come, Mr.\nBronze, let's go find another -\"",
      "\"Hold on,\" Harry said.",
      "\"Oh come on! That's just, just juvenile!\u202f\"",
      "\"No, I'm sorry Draco, I have to investigate this. What\nhappens if I drink Comed-Tea while doing my best to keep the\nconversation completely serious?\"",
      "The stallholder smiled mysteriously. \"Who knows? A friend walks\nby in a frog costume? Something unexpected is bound to happen\n-\"",
      "\"No. I'm sorry. I just don't believe it. That violates my\nmuch-abused suspension of disbelief on so many levels I don't even\nhave the language to describe it. There is, there is just no\nway a bloody drink can manipulate reality to produce\ncomedy setups, or I'm going to give up and retire to the\nBahamas -\"",
      "Draco groaned. \"Are we really going to do this?\"",
      "\"You don't have to drink it but I have to investigate.\nHave to. How much?\"",
      "\"Five Knuts the can,\" the stallholder said.",
      "\"Five Knuts? You can sell reality-manipulating fizzy\ndrinks for five Knuts the can?\" Harry reached into his\npouch, said \"four Sickles, four Knuts\", and slapped them down on\nthe counter. \"Two dozen cans please.\"",
      "\"I'll also take one,\" Draco sighed, and started to reach for his\npockets.",
      "Harry shook his head rapidly. \"No, I've got this, doesn't count\nas a favor either, I want to see if it works for you too.\" He took\na can from the stack now placed on the counter and tossed it to\nDraco, then started feeding his pouch. The pouch's Widening Lip ate\nthe cans accompanied by small burping noises, which wasn't exactly\nhelping to restore Harry's faith that he would someday discover a\nreasonable explanation for all this.",
      "Twenty-two burps later, Harry had the last purchased can in his\nhand, Draco was looking at him expectantly, and the two of them\npulled the ring at the same time.",
      "Harry rolled up his scarf to expose his mouth, and they tilted\ntheir heads back and drank the Comed-Tea.",
      "It somehow tasted bright green - extra-fizzy and limer\nthan lime.",
      "Aside from that, nothing else happened.",
      "Harry looked at the stallholder, who was watching them\nbenevolently.",
      "All right, if this guy just took advantage of a natural\naccident to sell me twenty-four cans of nothing, I'm going\nto applaud his creative entrepreneurial spirit and then kill\nhim.",
      "\"It doesn't always happen immediately,\" the stallholder said.\n\"But it's guaranteed to happen once per can, or your money\nback.\"",
      "Harry took another long drink.",
      "Once again, nothing happened.",
      "Maybe I should just chug the whole thing as fast as\npossible... and hope my stomach doesn't explode from all the carbon\ndioxide, or that I don't burp while drinking it...",
      "No, he could afford to be a little patient. But\nhonestly, Harry didn't see how this was going to work. You couldn't\ngo up to someone and say \"Now I'm going to surprise you\" or \"And\nnow I'm going to tell you the punchline of the joke, and it'll be\nreally funny.\" It ruined the shock value. In Harry's state of\nmental preparedness, Lucius Malfoy could have walked past in a\nballerina outfit and it wouldn't have made him do a proper\nspit-take. Just what sort of wacky shenanigan was the universe\nsupposed to cough up now?",
      "\"Anyway, let's sit down,\" Harry said. He prepared to swig\nanother drink and started towards the distant seating area, which\nput him at the right angle to glance back and see the portion of\nthe stall's newspaper stand that was devoted to a newspaper called\nThe Quibbler, which was showing the following\nheadline:",
      "BOY-WHO-LIVED GETS\nDRACO MALFOY PREGNANT",
      "\"Gah!\u202f\" screamed Draco as bright green liquid sprayed\nall over him from Harry's direction. Draco turned to Harry with\nfire in his eyes and grabbed his own can. \"You son of a mudblood!\nLet's see how you like being spat upon!\" Draco took a\ndeliberate swig from the can just as his own eyes caught sight of\nthe headline.",
      "In sheer reflex action, Harry tried to block his face as the\nspray of liquid flew in his direction. Unfortunately he blocked\nusing the hand containing the Comed-Tea, sending the rest of the\ngreen liquid to splash out over his shoulder.",
      "Harry stared at the can in his hand even as he went on choking\nand spluttering and the green colour started to vanish from Draco's\nrobes.",
      "Then he looked up and stared at the newspaper headline.",
      "BOY-WHO-LIVED GETS\nDRACO MALFOY PREGNANT",
      "Harry's lips opened and said, \"buh-bluh-buh-buh...\"",
      "Too many competing objections, that was the problem. Every time\nHarry tried to say \"But we're only eleven!\" the objection \"But men\ncan't get pregnant!\" demanded first priority and was then run over\nby \"But there's nothing between us, really!\"",
      "Then Harry looked down at the can in his hand again.",
      "He was feeling a deep-seated desire to run away screaming at the\ntop of his lungs until he dropped from lack of oxygen, and the only\nthing stopping him was that he had once read that outright panic\nwas the sign of a truly important scientific problem.",
      "Harry snarled, threw the can violently into a nearby rubbish\nbin, and stalked back over to the stall. \"One copy of The\nQuibbler, please.\" Harry paid over four more Knuts, retrieved\nanother can of Comed-Tea from his pouch, and then stalked over to\nthe picnic area with the blond-haired boy, who was staring at his\nown can with an expression of frank admiration.",
      "\"I take it back,\" Draco said, \"that was pretty good.\"",
      "\"Hey, Draco, you know what I bet is even better for becoming\nfriends than exchanging secrets? Committing murder.\"",
      "\"I have a tutor who says that,\" Draco allowed. He reached inside\nhis robes and scratched himself with an easy, natural motion.\n\"Who've you got in mind?\"",
      "Harry slammed The Quibbler down hard on the picnic\ntable. \"The guy who came up with this headline.\"",
      "Draco groaned. \"Not a guy. A girl. A ten-year-old girl,\ncan you believe it? She went nuts after her mother died and her\nfather, who owns this newspaper, is convinced that she's a\nseer, so when he doesn't know he asks Luna Lovegood and believes\nanything she says.\"",
      "Not really thinking about it, Harry pulled the ring on his next\ncan of Comed-Tea and prepared to drink. \"Are you kidding me? That's\neven worse than Muggle journalism, which I would have thought was\nphysically impossible.\"",
      "Draco snarled. \"She has some sort of perverse obsession about\nthe Malfoys, too, and her father is politically opposed to us so he\nprints every word. As soon as I'm old enough I'm going to rape\nher.\"",
      "Green liquid spurted out of Harry's nostrils, soaking into the\nscarf still covering that area. Comed-Tea and lungs did not mix,\nand Harry spent the next few seconds frantically coughing.",
      "Draco looked at him sharply. \"Something wrong?\"",
      "It was at this point that Harry came to the sudden realisation\nthat (a) the sounds coming from the rest of the train platform had\nturned into more of a blurred white noise at around the same time\nDraco had reached inside his robes, and (b) when he had discussed\ncommitting murder as a bonding method, there had been exactly one\nperson in the conversation who'd thought they were joking.",
      "Right. Because he seemed like such a normal kid.\nAnd he is a normal kid, he is just what you'd expect\na baseline male child to be like if Darth Vader were his doting\nfather.",
      "\"Yes, well,\" Harry coughed, oh god how was he going to get out\nof this conversational wedge, \"I was just surprised at how you were\nwilling to discuss it so openly, you didn't seem worried about\ngetting caught or anything.\"",
      "Draco snorted. \"Are you joking? Luna Lovegood's word\nagainst mine?\"",
      "Holy crap on a holy stick. \"There's no such thing as magical\ntruth detection, I take it?\" Or DNA testing... yet.",
      "Draco looked around. His eyes narrowed. \"That's right, you don't\nknow anything. Look, I'll explain things to you, I mean the way it\nreally works, just like you were already in Slytherin and asked me\nthe same question. But you've got to swear not to say anything\nabout it.\"",
      "\"I swear,\" Harry said.",
      "\"The courts use Veritaserum, but it's a joke really, you just\nget yourself Obliviated before you testify and then claim the other\nperson was Memory-Charmed with a fake memory. Of course if you're\njust some normal person, the courts presume in favor of\nObliviation, not False Memory Charms. But the court has discretion,\nand if I'm involved then it impinges on the honor of a\nNoble House, so it goes to the Wizengamot, where Father has the\nvotes. After I'm found not guilty the Lovegood family has to pay\nreparations for tarnishing my honor. And they know from the start\nthat's how it'll go, so they'll just keep their mouths shut.\"",
      "A cold chill was coming over Harry, a chill that came with\ninstructions to keep his voice and face normal. Note to self:\nOverthrow government of magical Britain at earliest\nconvenience.",
      "Harry coughed again to clear his throat. \"Draco, please please\nplease don't take this the wrong way, my word is my bond,\nbut like you said I could be in Slytherin and I really want to ask\nfor informational purposes, so what would happen theoretically\nspeaking if I did testify that I'd heard you plan\nit?\"",
      "\"Then if I was anyone other than a Malfoy, I'd be in trouble,\"\nDraco answered smugly. \"Since I am a Malfoy... Father has\nthe votes. And afterwards he'd crush you... well, I guess not\neasily, since you are the Boy-Who-Lived, but Father is\npretty good at that sort of thing.\" Draco frowned. \"'Sides,\nyou talked about murdering her, why weren't you worried\nabout me testifying after she turns up dead?\"",
      "How, oh how did my day go this wrong? Harry's mouth was\nalready moving faster than he could think. \"That's when I thought\nshe was older! I don't know how it works here,\nbut in Muggle Britain the courts would get a lot more upset about\nsomeone killing a child -\"",
      "\"That makes sense,\" Draco said, still looking a bit suspicious.\n\"But anyway, it's always smarter if it doesn't go to the Aurors at\nall. If we're careful only to do things that Healing Charms can\nfix, we can just Obliviate her afterwards and then do it all again\nnext week.\" Then the blonde-haired boy giggled, a youthful\nhigh-pitched sound. \"Though just imagine her saying she'd been done\nby Draco Malfoy and the Boy-Who-Lived, not even\nDumbledore would believe her.\"",
      "I am going to tear apart your pathetic little magical\nremnant of the Dark Ages into pieces smaller than its constituent\natoms. \"Actually, can we hold off on that? After I found out\nthat headline came from a girl a year younger than me, I had a\ndifferent thought for my revenge.\"",
      "\"Huh? Do tell,\" Draco said, and started to take another swig of\nhis Comed-Tea.",
      "Harry didn't know if the enchantment worked more than once per\ncan, but he did know he could avoid the blame, so he was\ncareful to time it exactly right:",
      "\"I was thinking someday I'm going to marry that\nwoman.\"",
      "Draco made a horrid ker-splutching sound and leaked green fluid\nout the corners of his mouth like a broken car radiator. \"Are\nyou nuts?\u202f\"",
      "\"Quite the opposite, I'm so sane it burns like ice.\"",
      "\"You've got weirder taste than a Lestrange,\" Draco said,\nsounding half-admiring about it. \"And I suppose you want her all to\nyourself, huh?\"",
      "\"Yep. I can owe you a favor for it -\"",
      "Draco waved it off. \"Nah, this one's free.\"",
      "Harry stared down at the can in his hand, the coldness settling\ninto his blood. Charming, happy, generous with his favors to his\nfriends, Draco wasn't a psychopath. That was the sad and awful\npart, knowing human psychology well enough to know that\nDraco wasn't a monster. There had been ten thousand\nsocieties over the history of the world where this conversation\ncould have happened. No, the world would have been a very different\nplace indeed, if it took an evil mutant to say\nwhat Draco had said. It was very simple, very human, it was the\ndefault if nothing else intervened. To Draco, his enemies weren't\npeople.",
      "And in the slowed time of this slowed country, here and now as\nin the darkness-before-dawn prior to the Age of Reason, the son of\na sufficiently powerful noble would simply take for granted that he\nwas above the law, at least when it came to some peasant girl.\nThere were places in Muggle-land where it was still the same way,\ncountries where that sort of nobility still existed and still\nthought like that, or even grimmer lands where it wasn't just the\nnobility. It was like that in every place and time that didn't\ndescend directly from the Enlightenment. A line of descent, it\nseemed, which didn't quite include magical Britain, for all that\nthere had been cross-cultural contamination of things like\nring-pull drinks cans.",
      "And if Draco doesn't change his mind about wanting revenge,\nand I don't throw away my own chance at happiness in life to marry\nsome poor crazy girl, then all I've just bought is time, and not\ntoo much of it...",
      "For one girl. Not for others.",
      "I wonder how difficult it would be to just make a list of\nall the top blood purists and kill them.",
      "They'd tried exactly that during the French Revolution, more or\nless - make a list of all the enemies of Progress and remove\neverything above the neck - and it hadn't worked out well from what\nHarry recalled. Maybe he needed to dust off some of those history\nbooks his father had bought him, and see if what had gone wrong\nwith the French Revolution was something easy to fix.",
      "Harry gazed up at the sky, and at the pale shape of the Moon,\nvisible this morning through the cloudless air.",
      "So the world is broken and flawed and insane, and cruel and\nbloody and dark. This is news? You always knew that,\nanyway...",
      "\"You're looking all serious,\" Draco said. \"Let me guess, your\nMuggle parents told you that this sort of thing was bad.\"",
      "Harry nodded, not quite trusting his voice.",
      "\"Well, like Father says, there may be four houses, but in the\nend everyone belongs to either Slytherin or Hufflepuff. And\nfrankly, you're not on the Hufflepuff end. If you decide to side\nwith the Malfoys under the table... our power and your\nreputation... you could get away with things even I can't\ndo. Want to try it for a while? See what it's like?\"",
      "Aren't we a clever little serpent. Eleven years old and\nalready coaxing your prey from hiding...",
      "Harry thought, considered, chose his weapon. \"Draco, you want to\nexplain the whole blood purity thing to me? I'm sort of new.\"",
      "A wide smile crossed Draco's face. \"You really should meet\nFather and ask him, you know, he's our leader.\"",
      "\"Give me the thirty-second version.\"",
      "\"Okay,\" Draco said. He drew in a deep breath, and his voice grew\nslightly lower, and took on a cadence. \"Our powers have grown\nweaker, generation by generation, as the mudblood taint increases.\nWhere Salazar and Godric and Rowena and Helga once raised Hogwarts\nby their power, creating the Locket and the Sword and the Diadem\nand the Cup, no wizard of these faded days has risen to rival them.\nWe are fading, all fading into Muggles as we interbreed with their\nspawn and allow our Squibs to live. If the taint is not checked,\nsoon our wands will break and all our arts cease, the line of\nMerlin will end and the blood of Atlantis fail. Our children will\nbe left scratching at the dirt to survive like the mere Muggles,\nand darkness will cover all the world for ever.\" Draco took another\nswig from his drinks can, looking satisfied; that seemed to be the\nwhole argument as far as he was concerned.",
      "\"Persuasive,\" Harry said, meaning it descriptively rather than\nnormatively. It was a standard pattern: The Fall from Grace, the\nneed to guard what purity remained against contamination, the past\nsloping upwards and the future sloping only down. And that pattern\nalso had its counter... \"I have to correct you on one\npoint of fact, though. Your information about the Muggles is a bit\nout of date. We aren't exactly scratching at the dirt anymore.\"",
      "Draco's head snapped around. \"What? What do you mean,\nwe?\u202f\"",
      "\"We. The scientists. The line of Francis Bacon and the blood of\nthe Enlightenment. Muggles didn't just sit around crying about not\nhaving wands, we have our own powers now, with or without\nmagic. If all your powers fail then we will all have lost something\nvery precious, because your magic is the only hint we have as to\nhow the universe must really work - but you won't be left\nscratching at the ground. Your houses will still be cool in summer\nand warm in winter, there will still be doctors and medicine.\nScience can keep you alive if magic fails. It'd be a tragedy, but\nnot literally the end of all the light in the world. Just\nsaying.\"",
      "Draco had backed up several feet and his face was full of mixed\nfear and disbelief. \"What in the name of Merlin are you talking\nabout, Potter?\u202f\"",
      "\"Hey, I listened to your story, won't you listen to\nmine?\" Clumsy, Harry chided himself, but Draco actually\ndid stop backing off and seem to listen.",
      "\"Anyway,\" Harry said, \"I'm saying that you don't seem to have\nbeen paying much attention to what goes on in the Muggle world.\"\nProbably because the whole wizarding world seemed to regard the\nrest of Earth as a slum, deserving around as much news coverage as\nthe Financial Times awarded to the routine agonies of\nBurundi. \"All right. Quick check. Have wizards ever been to the\nMoon? You know, that thing?\" Harry pointed up to that huge and\ndistant globe.",
      "\"What?\u202f\" Draco said. It was pretty clear the thought\nhad never occured to the boy. \"Go to the - it's just a -\"\nHis finger pointed at the little pale thingy in the sky. \"You can't\nApparate to somewhere you've never been and how would\nanyone get to the Moon in the first place?\"",
      "\"Hold on,\" Harry said to Draco, \"I'd like to show you a book I\nbrought with me, I think I remember what box it's in.\" And Harry\nstood up and kneeled down and yanked out the stairs to the cavern\nlevel of his trunk, then tore down the stairs and heaved a box off\nanother box, coming perilously close to treating his books with\ndisrespect, and snatched off the box cover and quickly but\ncarefully pried out a stack of books -",
      "(Harry had inherited the nigh-magical Verres ability to remember\nwhere all his books were, even after seeing them just once, which\nwas rather mysterious considering the lack of any genetic\nconnection.)",
      "And Harry raced back up the stairs and shoved the staircase back\ninto the trunk with his heel, and, panting, turned the pages of the\nbook until he found the picture he wanted to show to Draco.",
      "The one with the white, dry, cratered land, and the suited\npeople, and the blue-white globe hanging over it all.",
      "That picture.",
      "The picture, if only one picture in all the world were\nto survive.",
      "\"That,\" Harry said, his voice trembling because he\ncouldn't quite keep the pride out, \"is what the Earth looks like\nfrom the Moon.\"",
      "Draco slowly leaned over. There was a strange expression on his\nyoung face. \"If that's a real picture, why isn't it\nmoving?\"",
      "Moving? Oh. \"Muggles can do moving pictures but they\nneed a bigger box to show it, they can't fit them onto single book\npages yet.\"",
      "Draco's finger moved to one of the suits. \"What are those?\" His\nvoice starting to waver.",
      "\"Those are human beings. They are wearing suits that cover their\nwhole bodies to give them air, because there is no air on the\nMoon.\"",
      "\"That's impossible,\" Draco whispered. There was terror in his\neyes, and utter confusion. \"No Muggle could ever do that.\nHow...\"",
      "Harry took back the book, flipped the pages until he found what\nhe saw. \"This is a rocket going up. The fire pushes it higher and\nhigher, until it gets to the Moon.\" Flipped pages again. \"This is a\nrocket on the ground. That tiny speck next to it is a person.\"\nDraco gasped. \"Going to the Moon cost the equivalent of... probably\naround a thousand million Galleons.\" Draco choked. \"And it took the\nefforts of... probably more people than live in all of magical\nBritain.\" And when they arrived, they left a plaque that said,\n'We came in peace, for all mankind.' Though you're not yet ready to\nhear those words, Draco Malfoy...",
      "\"You're telling the truth,\" Draco said slowly. \"You wouldn't\nfake a whole book just for this - and I can hear it in your voice.\nBut... but...\"",
      "\"How, without wands or magic? It's a long story, Draco. Science\ndoesn't work by waving wands and chanting spells, it works by\nknowing how the universe works on such a deep level that you know\nexactly what to do in order to make the universe do what you want.\nIf magic is like casting Imperio on someone to make them\ndo what you want, then science is like knowing them so well that\nyou can convince them it was their own idea all along. It's a lot\nmore difficult than waving a wand, but it works when wands fail,\njust like if the Imperius failed you could still try\npersuading a person. And Science builds from generation to\ngeneration. You have to really know what you're doing to\ndo science - and when you really understand something, you can\nexplain it to someone else. The greatest scientists of one century\nago, the brightest names that are still spoken with reverence,\ntheir powers are as nothing to the greatest scientists of\ntoday. There is no equivalent in science of your lost arts that\nraised Hogwarts. In science our powers wax by the year. And we are\nbeginning to understand and unravel the secrets of life and\ninheritance. We'll be able to look at the very blood of which you\nspoke, and see what makes you a wizard, and in one or two more\ngenerations, we'll be able to persuade that blood to make all your\nchildren powerful wizards too. So you see, your problem isn't\nnearly as bad as it looks, because in a few more decades, science\nwill be able to solve it for you.\"",
      "\"But...\" Draco said. His voice was trembling. \"If\nMuggles have that kind of power... then... what are\nwe?\u202f\"",
      "\"No, Draco, that's not it, don't you see? Science taps the power\nof human understanding to look at the world and figure out how it\nworks. It can't fail without humanity itself failing. Your magic\ncould turn off, and you would hate that, but you would still be\nyou. You would still be alive to regret it. But because\nscience rests upon my human intelligence, it is the power that\ncannot be removed from me without removing me. Even if the\nlaws of the universe change on me, so that all my knowledge is\nvoid, I'll just figure out the new laws, as has been done before.\nIt's not a Muggle thing, it's a human thing, it\njust refines and trains the power you use every time you look at\nsomething you don't understand and ask 'Why?' You're of Slytherin,\nDraco, don't you see the implication?\"",
      "Draco looked up from the book to Harry. His face showed dawning\nunderstanding. \"Wizards can learn to use this power.\"",
      "Very carefully, now... the bait is set, now the hook... \"If you\ncan learn to think of yourself as a human instead of a\nwizard then you can train and refine your powers as a\nhuman.\"",
      "And if that instruction wasn't in every\nscience curriculum, Draco didn't need to know it, did he?",
      "Draco's eyes were now thoughtful. \"You've... already done\nthis?\"",
      "\"To some extent,\" Harry allowed. \"My training isn't complete.\nNot at eleven. But - my father also bought me tutors, you\nsee.\" Sure, they'd been starving grad students, and it had only\nbeen because Harry slept on a 26-hour cycle, but leave all that\naside for now...",
      "Slowly, Draco nodded. \"You think you can master both\narts, add the powers together, and...\" Draco stared at Harry. \"Make\nyourself Lord of the two worlds?\"",
      "Harry gave an evil laugh, it just seemed to come naturally at\nthat point. \"You have to realise, Draco, that the whole world you\nknow, all of magical Britain, is just one square on a much larger\ngameboard. The gameboard that includes places like the Moon, and\nthe stars in the night sky, which are lights just like the Sun only\nunimaginably far away, and things like galaxies that are vastly\nhuger than the Earth and Sun, things so large that only scientists\ncan see them and you don't even know they exist. But I really\nam Ravenclaw, you know, not Slytherin. I don't want to\nrule the universe. I just think it could be more sensibly\norganised.\"",
      "There was awe on Draco's face. \"Why are you telling me\nthis?\"",
      "\"Oh... there aren't many people who know how to do true\nscience - understanding something for the very first time, even if\nit confuses the hell out of you. Help would be helpful.\"",
      "Draco stared at Harry with his mouth open.",
      "\"But make no mistake, Draco, true science really isn't\nlike magic, you can't just do it and walk away unchanged like\nlearning how to say the words of a new spell. The power comes with\na cost, a cost so high that most people refuse to pay it.\"",
      "Draco nodded at this as though, finally, he'd heard something he\ncould understand. \"And that cost?\"",
      "\"Learning to admit you're wrong.\"",
      "\"Um,\" Draco said after the dramatic pause had stretched on for a\nwhile. \"You going to explain that?\"",
      "\"Trying to figure out how something works on that deep level,\nthe first ninety-nine explanations you come up with are wrong. The\nhundredth is right. So you have to learn how to admit you're wrong,\nover and over and over again. It doesn't sound like much, but it's\nso hard that most people can't do science. Always questioning\nyourself, always taking another look at things you've always taken\nfor granted,\" like having a Snitch in Quidditch, \"and every time\nyou change your mind, you change yourself. But I'm getting way\nahead of myself here. Way ahead of myself. I just want you to\nknow... I'm offering to share some of my knowledge. If you want.\nThere's just one condition.\"",
      "\"Uh huh,\" Draco said. \"You know, Father says that when someone\nsays that to you, it is never a good sign, ever.\"",
      "Harry nodded. \"Now, don't mistake me and think that I'm trying\nto drive a wedge between you and your father. It's not about that.\nIt's just about me wanting to deal with someone my own age, rather\nthan having this be between me and Lucius. I think your father\nwould be okay with that too, he knows you have to grow up sometime.\nBut your moves in our game have to be your own. That's my condition\n- that I'm dealing with you, Draco, not your father.\"",
      "\"I've got to go,\" Draco said. He stood up. \"I've got to go off\nand think about this.\"",
      "\"Take your time,\" Harry said.",
      "The sounds of the train platform changed from blurs into murmurs\nas Draco wandered off.",
      "Harry slowly exhaled the air he'd been holding in without quite\nrealising it, and then looked at the watch on his wrist, a simple\nmechanical model that his father had bought him in hope it would\nwork in magic's presence. The second-hand was still ticking, and if\nthe minute hand was right, then it wasn't quite eleven just yet. He\nprobably ought to get on the train soon and start looking for\nwhatsherface, but it seemed worth taking a few minutes first to do\nsome breathing exercises and see if his blood warmed up again.",
      "But when Harry looked up from his watch, he saw two figures\napproaching, looking utterly ridiculous with their faces cloaked by\nwinter scarves.",
      "\"Hello, Mr. Bronze,\" said one of the masked figures. \"Can we\ninterest you in joining the Order of Chaos?\"",
      "Aftermath:",
      "Not too long after that, when all that day's fuss had finally\nsubsided, Draco was bent over a desk with quill in hand. He had a\nprivate room in the Slytherin dungeons, with its own desk and its\nown fire - sadly not even he rated a connection to the\nFloo system, but at least Slytherin didn't buy into that utter\nnonsense about making everyone sleep in dorms. There\nweren't many private rooms, you had to be the very best\nwithin the House of the better sort, but that could be taken for\ngranted with the House of Malfoy.",
      "Dear Father, Draco wrote.",
      "And then he stopped.",
      "Ink slowly dripped from his quill, staining the parchment near\nthe words.",
      "Draco wasn't stupid. He was young, but his tutors had trained\nhim well. Draco knew that Potter probably felt a lot more sympathy\ntowards Dumbledore's faction than Potter was letting on... though\nDraco did think Potter could be tempted. But it was crystal clear\nthat Potter was trying to tempt Draco just as Draco was trying to\ntempt him.",
      "And it was also clear that Potter was brilliant, and a whole lot\nmore than just slightly mad, and playing a vast game that Potter\nhimself mostly didn't understand, improvised at top speed with the\nsubtlety of a rampaging nundu. But Potter had managed to choose a\ntactic that Draco couldn't just walk away from. He had offered\nDraco a part of his own power, gambling that Draco couldn't use it\nwithout becoming more like him. His father had called this an\nadvanced technique, and had warned Draco that it often didn't\nwork.",
      "Draco knew he hadn't understood everything that had happened...\nbut Potter had offered him the chance to play and right\nnow it was his. And if he blurted the whole thing out, it\nwould become Father's.",
      "In the end it was as simple as that. The lesser techniques\nrequire the unawareness of the target, or at least their\nuncertainty. Flattery has to be plausibly disguised as admiration.\n(\"You should have been in Slytherin\" is an old classic, highly\neffective on a certain type of person who isn't expecting it, and\nif it works you can repeat it.) But when you find someone's\nultimate lever it doesn't matter if they know you know. Potter, in\nhis mad rush, had guessed a key to Draco's soul. And if Draco knew\nthat Potter knew it - even if it had been an obvious sort of guess\n- that didn't change anything.",
      "So now, for the first time in his life, he had real secrets to\nkeep. He was playing his own game. There was an obscure pain to it,\nbut he knew that Father would be proud, and that made it all\nright.",
      "Leaving the ink drippings in place - there was a message there,\nand one that his father would understand, for they had played the\ngame of subtleties more than once - Draco wrote out the one\nquestion that really had gnawed at him about the whole affair, the\npart that it seemed he ought to understand, but he didn't,\nnot at all.",
      "Dear Father:",
      "Suppose I told you that I met a student at Hogwarts, not\nalready part of our circle of acquaintances, who called you a\n'flawless instrument of death' and said that I was your 'one weak\npoint'. What would you say about him?",
      "It didn't take long after that for the family owl to bring the\nreply.",
      "My beloved son:",
      "I would say that you had been so fortunate as to meet\nsomeone who enjoys the intimate confidence of our friend and\nvaluable ally, Severus Snape.",
      "Draco stared at the letter for a while, and finally threw it\ninto the fire."

I regret that\nFFN does not allow me any larger font size in which to say\nNO. It honestly hadn't occurred to me that Luna\nmight be a real seer - I'll have to decide whether to run\nwith that or not - but I think we can all safely assume that if\nLuna is a seer, she said something about \"light planting a\nseed in darkness\", and Xenophilius, as always, interpreted this in\nrather the wrong way.",

      "No one had asked for help, that was the problem. They'd just\ngone around talking, eating, or staring into the air while their\nparents exchanged gossip. For whatever odd reason, no one had been\nsitting down reading a book, which meant she couldn't just sit down\nnext to them and take out her own book. And even when she'd boldly\ntaken the initiative by sitting down and continuing her third\nread-through of Hogwarts: A History, no one had seemed\ninclined to sit down next to her.",
      "Aside from helping people with their homework, or anything else\nthey needed, she really didn't know how to meet people. She didn't\nfeel like she was a shy person. She thought of herself as\na take-charge sort of girl. And yet, somehow, if there wasn't some\nrequest along the lines of \"I can't remember how to do long\ndivision\" then it was just too awkward to go up to someone\nand say... what? She'd never been able to figure out what. And\nthere didn't seem to be a standard information sheet, which was\nridiculous. The whole business of meeting people had never seemed\nsensible to her. Why did she have to take all the\nresponsibility herself when there were two people involved? Why\ndidn't adults ever help? She wished some other girl would just walk\nup to her and say, \"Hermione, the teacher told me to be\nfriends with you.\"",
      "But let it be quite clear that Hermione Granger, sitting alone\non the first day of school in one of the few compartments that had\nbeen empty, in the last carriage of the train, with the compartment\ndoor left open just in case anyone for any reason wanted to talk to\nher, was not sad, lonely, gloomy, depressed, despairing,\nor obsessing about her problems. She was, rather, rereading\nHogwarts: A History for the third time and quite enjoying\nit, with only a faint tinge of annoyance in the back of her mind at\nthe general unreasonableness of the world.",
      "There was the sound of an inter-train door opening, and then\nfootsteps and an odd slithering sound coming down the hallway of\nthe train. Hermione laid aside Hogwarts: A History and\nstood up and stuck her head outside - just in case someone needed\nhelp - and saw a young boy in a wizard's dress robes, probably\nfirst or second year going by his height, and looking quite silly\nwith a scarf wrapped around his head. A small trunk stood on the\nfloor next to him. Even as she saw him, he knocked on the door of\nanother, closed compartment, and he said in a voice only slightly\nmuffled by the scarf, \"Excuse me, can I ask a quick question?\"",
      "She didn't hear the answer from inside the compartment, but\nafter the boy opened the door, she did think she heard him say -\nunless she'd somehow misheard - \"Does anyone here know the six\nquarks or where I can find a first-year girl named Hermione\nGranger?\"",
      "After the boy had closed that compartment door, Hermione said,\n\"Can I help you with something?\"",
      "The scarfed face turned to look at her, and the voice said, \"Not\nunless you can name the six quarks or tell me where to find\nHermione Granger.\"",
      "\"Up, down, strange, charm, truth, beauty, and why are you\nlooking for her?\"",
      "It was hard to tell from this distance, but she thought she saw\nthe boy grin widely under his scarf. \"Ah, so you're a\nfirst-year girl named Hermione Granger,\" said that young, muffled\nvoice. \"On the train to Hogwarts, no less.\" The boy started to walk\ntowards her and her compartment, and his trunk slithered along\nafter him. \"Technically, all I needed to do was look for\nyou, but it seems likely that I'm meant to talk to you or invite\nyou to join my party or get a key magical item from you or find out\nthat Hogwarts was built over the ruins of an ancient temple or\nsomething. PC or NPC, that is the question?\"",
      "Hermione opened her mouth to reply to this, but then she\ncouldn't think of any possible reply to...\nwhatever it was she'd just heard, even as the boy walked\nover to her, looked inside the compartment, nodded with\nsatisfaction, and sat down on the bench across from her own. His\ntrunk scurried in after him, grew to three times its former\ndiameter and snuggled up next to her own in an oddly disturbing\nfashion.",
      "\"Please, have a seat,\" said the boy, \"and do please close the\ndoor behind you, if you would. Don't worry, I don't bite anyone who\ndoesn't bite me first.\" He was already unwinding the scarf from\naround his head.",
      "The imputation that this boy thought she was scared of\nhim made her hand send the door sliding shut, jamming it into the\nwall with unnecessary force. She spun around and saw a young face\nwith bright, laughing green eyes, and an angry red-dark scar set\ninto his forehead that reminded her of something in the back of her\nmind but right now she had more important things to think about. \"I\ndidn't say I was Hermione Granger!\"",
      "\"I didn't say you said you were Hermione\nGranger, I just said you were Hermione Granger. If you're asking\nhow I know, it's because I know everything. Good evening ladies and\ngentlemen, my name is Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres or Harry\nPotter for short, I know that probably doesn't mean anything to\nyou for a change -\"",
      "Hermione's mind finally made the connection. The scar on his\nforehead, the shape of a lightning bolt. \"Harry Potter! You're in\nModern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the\nDark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth\nCentury.\" It was actually the very first time in her whole\nlife that she'd met someone from inside a book,\nand it was a rather odd feeling.",
      "The boy blinked three times. \"I'm in books? Wait, of\ncourse I'm in books... what a strange thought.\"",
      "\"Goodness, didn't you know?\" said Hermione. \"I'd have found out\neverything I could if it was me.\"",
      "The boy spoke rather dryly. \"Miss Granger, it has been less than\n72 hours since I went to Diagon Alley and discovered my claim to\nfame. I have spent the last two days buying science books.\nBelieve me, I intend to find out everything I can.\" The\nboy hesitated. \"What do the books say about me?\"",
      "Hermione Granger's mind flashed back, she hadn't realised she\nwould be tested on those books so she'd read them only\nonce, but it was just a month ago so the material was still fresh\nin her mind. \"You're the only one who's survived the Killing Curse\nso you're called the Boy-Who-Lived. You were born to James Potter\nand Lily Potter formerly Lily Evans on the 31st of July 1980. On\nthe 31st of October 1981 the Dark Lord He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\nthough I don't know why not attacked your home. You were found\nalive with the scar on your forehead in the ruins of your parents'\nhouse near the burnt remains of You-Know-Who's body. Chief Warlock\nAlbus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore sent you off somewhere, no\none knows where. The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts claims\nthat you survived because of your mother's love and that your scar\ncontains all of the Dark Lord's magical power and that the centaurs\nfear you, but Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth\nCentury doesn't mention anything like that and Modern\nMagical History warns that there are lots of crackpot theories\nabout you.\"",
      "The boy's mouth was hanging open. \"Were you told to wait for\nHarry Potter on the train to Hogwarts, or something like that?\"",
      "\"No,\" Hermione said. \"Who told you about me?\u202f\"",
      "\"Professor McGonagall and I believe I see why. Do you have an\neidetic memory, Hermione?\"",
      "Hermione shook her head. \"It's not photographic, I've always\nwished it was but I had to read my school books five times over to\nmemorize them all.\"",
      "\"Really,\" the boy said in a slightly strangled voice. \"I hope\nyou don't mind if I test that - it's not that I don't believe you,\nbut as the saying goes, 'Trust, but verify'. No point in wondering\nwhen I can just do the experiment.\"",
      "Hermione smiled, rather smugly. She so loved tests. \"Go\nahead.\"",
      "The boy stuck a hand into a pouch at his side and said \"Magical\nDrafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger\". When he withdrew his hand\nit was holding the book he'd named.",
      "Instantly Hermione wanted one of those pouches more than she'd\never wanted anything.",
      "The boy opened the book to somewhere in the middle and looked\ndown. \"If you were making oil of sharpness -\"",
      "\"I can see that page from here, you know!\"",
      "The boy tilted the book so that she couldn't see it any more,\nand flipped the pages again. \"If you were brewing a potion of\nspider climbing, what would be the next ingredient you added\nafter the Acromantula silk?\"",
      "\"After dropping in the silk, wait until the potion has turned\nexactly the shade of the cloudless dawn sky, 8 degrees from the\nhorizon and 8 minutes before the tip of the sun first becomes\nvisible. Stir eight times widdershins and once deasil, and then add\neight drams of unicorn bogies.\"",
      "The boy shut the book with a sharp snap and put the book back\ninto his pouch, which swallowed it with a small burping noise.\n\"Well well well well well well. I should like to make you\na proposition, Miss Granger.\"",
      "\"A proposition?\" Hermione said suspiciously. Girls weren't\nsupposed to listen to those.",
      "It was also at this point that Hermione realised the other thing\n- well, one of the things - which was odd about the boy. Apparently\npeople who were in books actually sounded like a\nbook when they talked. This was quite the surprising discovery.",
      "The boy reached into his pouch and said, \"can of pop\",\nretrieving a bright green cylinder. He held it out to her and said,\n\"Can I offer you something to drink?\"",
      "Hermione politely accepted the fizzy drink. In fact she\nwas feeling sort of thirsty by now. \"Thank you very much,\"\nHermione said as she popped the top. \"Was that your\nproposition?\"",
      "The boy coughed. \"No,\" he said. Just as Hermione started to\ndrink, he said, \"I'd like you to help me take over the\nuniverse.\"",
      "Hermione finished her drink and lowered the can. \"No thank you,\nI'm not evil.\"",
      "The boy looked at her in surprise, as though he'd been expecting\nsome other answer. \"Well, I was speaking a bit rhetorically,\" he\nsaid. \"In the sense of the Baconian project, you know, not\npolitical power. 'The effecting of all things possible' and so on.\nI want to conduct experimental studies of spells, figure out the\nunderlying laws, bring magic into the domain of science, merge the\nwizarding and Muggle worlds, raise the entire planet's standard of\nliving, move humanity centuries ahead, discover the secret of\nimmortality, colonize the Solar System, explore the galaxy, and\nmost importantly, figure out what the heck is really going on here\nbecause all of this is blatantly impossible.\"",
      "That sounded a bit more interesting. \"And?\"",
      "The boy stared at her incredulously. \"And? That's not\nenough?\u202f\"",
      "\"And what do you want from me?\" said Hermione.",
      "\"I want you to help me do the research, of course. With your\nencyclopedic memory added to my intelligence and rationality, we'll\nhave the Baconian project finished in no time, where by 'no time' I\nmean probably at least thirty-five years.\"",
      "Hermione was beginning to find this boy annoying. \"I haven't\nseen you do anything intelligent. Maybe I'll let you help\nme with my research.\"",
      "There was a certain silence in the compartment.",
      "\"So you're asking me to demonstrate my intelligence, then,\" said\nthe boy after a long pause.",
      "Hermione nodded.",
      "\"I warn you that challenging my ingenuity is a dangerous\nproject, and tends to make your life a lot more surreal.\"",
      "\"I'm not impressed yet,\" Hermione said. Unnoticed, the green\ndrink once again rose to her lips.",
      "\"Well, maybe this will impress you,\" the boy said. He\nleaned forward and looked at her intensely. \"I've already done a\nbit of experimenting and I found out that I don't need the wand, I\ncan make anything I want happen just by snapping my fingers.\"",
      "It came just as Hermione was in the middle of swallowing, and\nshe choked and coughed and expelled the bright green fluid.",
      "Onto her brand new, never-worn witch's robes, on the very first\nday of school.",
      "Hermione actually screamed. It was a high-pitched sound that\nsounded like an air raid siren in the closed compartment. \"Eek!\nMy clothes!\u202f\"",
      "\"Don't panic!\" said the boy. \"I can fix it for you. Just watch!\"\nHe raised a hand and snapped his fingers.",
      "\"You'll -\" Then she looked down at herself.",
      "The green fluid was still there, but even as she watched, it\nstarted to vanish and fade and within just a few moments, it was\nlike she'd never spilled anything at herself.",
      "Hermione stared at the boy, who was wearing a rather smug sort\nof smile.",
      "Wordless wandless magic! At his age? When he'd only\ngotten the schoolbooks three days ago?",
      "Then she remembered what she'd read, and she gasped and flinched\nback from him. All the Dark Lord's magical power! In his\nscar!",
      "She rose hastily to her feet. \"I, I, I need to go the toilet,\nwait here all right -\" she had to find a grownup she had to tell\nthem -",
      "The boy's smile faded. \"It was just a trick, Hermione. I'm\nsorry, I didn't mean to scare you.\"",
      "Her hand halted on the door handle. \"A trick?\u202f\"",
      "\"Yes,\" said the boy. \"You asked me to demonstrate my\nintelligence. So I did something apparently impossible, which is\nalways a good way to show off. I can't really do anything\njust by snapping my fingers.\" The boy paused. \"At least I don't\nthink I can, I've never actually tested it\nexperimentally.\" The boy raised his hand and snapped his fingers\nagain. \"Nope, no banana.\"",
      "Hermione was as confused as she'd ever been in her life.",
      "The boy was now smiling again at the look on her face. \"I did\nwarn you that challenging my ingenuity tends to make your\nlife surreal. Do remember this the next time I warn you about\nsomething.\"",
      "\"But, but,\" Hermione stammered. \"What did you do,\nthen?\"",
      "The boy's gaze took on a measuring, weighing quality that she'd\nnever seen before from someone her own age. \"You think you have\nwhat it takes to be a scientist in your own right, with or without\nmy help? Then let's see how you investigate a confusing\nphenomenon.\"",
      "\"I...\" Hermione's mind went blank for a moment. She loved tests\nbut she'd never had a test like this before. Frantically,\nshe tried to cast back for anything she'd read about what\nscientists were supposed to do. Her mind skipped gears, ground\nagainst itself, and spat back the instructions for doing a science\ninvestigation project:",
      "Step 1: Form a hypothesis.\nStep 2: Do an experiment to test your hypothesis.\nStep 3: Measure the results.\nStep 4: Make a cardboard poster.",
      "Step 1 was to form a hypothesis. That meant, try to think of\nsomething that could have happened just now. \"All right.\nMy hypothesis is that you cast a Charm on my robes to make anything\nspilled on it vanish.\"",
      "\"All right,\" said the boy, \"is that your answer?\"",
      "The shock was wearing off, and Hermione's mind was starting to\nwork properly. \"Wait, that can't be right. I didn't see you touch\nyour wand or say any spells so how could you have cast a\nCharm?\"",
      "The boy waited, his face neutral.",
      "\"But suppose all the robes come from the store with a Charm\nalready on them to keep them clean, which would be a\nuseful sort of Charm for them to have. You found that out by\nspilling something on yourself earlier.\"",
      "Now the boy's eyebrows lifted. \"Is that your\nanswer?\"",
      "\"No, I haven't done Step 2, 'Do an experiment to test your\nhypothesis.'\"",
      "The boy closed his mouth again, and began to smile.",
      "Hermione looked at the drinks can, which she'd automatically put\ninto the cupholder at the window. She took it up and peered inside,\nand found that it was around one-third full.",
      "\"Well,\" said Hermione, \"the experiment I want to do is to pour\nit on my robes and see what happens, and my prediction is that the\nstain will disappear. Only if it doesn't work, my robes\nwill be stained, and I don't want that.\"",
      "\"Do it to mine,\" said the boy, \"that way you don't have to worry\nabout your robes getting stained.\"",
      "\"But -\" Hermione said. There was something wrong with\nthat thinking but she didn't know how to say it exactly.",
      "\"I have spare robes in my trunk,\" said the boy.",
      "\"But there's nowhere for you to change,\" Hermione objected. Then\nshe thought better of it. \"Though I suppose I could leave and close\nthe door -\"",
      "\"I have somewhere to change in my trunk, too.\"",
      "Hermione looked at his trunk, which, she was beginning to\nsuspect, was rather more special than her own.",
      "\"All right,\" Hermione said, \"since you say so,\" and she rather\ngingerly poured a bit of green pop onto a corner of the boy's\nrobes. Then she stared at it, trying to remember how long the\noriginal fluid had taken to disappear...",
      "And the green stain vanished!",
      "Hermione let out a sigh of relief, not least because this meant\nshe wasn't dealing with all of the Dark Lord's magical power.",
      "Well, Step 3 was measuring the results, but in this case that\nwas just seeing that the stain had vanished. And she supposed she\ncould probably skip Step 4, about the cardboard poster. \"My answer\nis that the robes are Charmed to keep themselves clean.\"",
      "\"Not quite,\" said the boy.",
      "Hermione felt a stab of disappointment. She really wished she\nwouldn't have felt that way, the boy wasn't a teacher, but\nit was still a test and she'd gotten a question wrong and that\nalways felt like a little punch in the stomach.",
      "(It said almost everything you needed to know about Hermione\nGranger that she had never let that stop her, or even let it\ninterfere with her love of being tested.)",
      "\"The sad thing is,\" said the boy, \"you probably did everything\nthe book told you to do. You made a prediction that would\ndistinguish between the robe being charmed and not charmed, and you\ntested it, and rejected the null hypothesis that the robe was not\ncharmed. But unless you read the very, very best sort of books,\nthey won't quite teach you how to do science properly.\nWell enough to really get the right answer, I mean, and\nnot just churn out another publication like Dad always complains\nabout. So let me try to explain - without giving away the answer -\nwhat you did wrong this time, and I'll give you another\nchance.\"",
      "She was starting to resent the boy's oh-so-superior tone when he\nwas just another eleven-year-old like her, but that was secondary\nto finding out what she'd done wrong. \"All right.\"",
      "The boy's expression grew more intense. \"This is a game based on\na famous experiment called the 2-4-6 task, and this is how it\nworks. I have a rule - known to me, but not to you - which\nfits some triplets of three numbers, but not others. 2-4-6 is one\nexample of a triplet which fits the rule. In fact... let me write\ndown the rule, just so you know it's a fixed rule, and fold it up\nand give it to you. Please don't look, since I infer from earlier\nthat you can read upside-down.\"",
      "The boy said \"paper\" and \"mechanical pencil\" to his pouch, and\nshe shut her eyes tightly while he wrote.",
      "\"There,\" said the boy, and he was holding a tightly folded piece\nof paper. \"Put this in your pocket,\" and she did.",
      "\"Now the way this game works,\" said the boy, \"is that you give\nme a triplet of three numbers, and I'll tell you 'Yes' if the three\nnumbers are an instance of the rule, and 'No' if they're not. I am\nNature, the rule is one of my laws, and you are investigating me.\nYou already know that 2-4-6 gets a 'Yes'. When you've performed all\nthe further experimental tests you want - asked me as many triplets\nas you feel necessary - you stop and guess the rule, and then you\ncan unfold the sheet of paper and see how you did. Do you\nunderstand the game?\"",
      "\"Of course I do,\" said Hermione.",
      "\"Go.\"",
      "\"4-6-8\" said Hermione.",
      "\"Yes,\" said the boy.",
      "\"10-12-14\", said Hermione.",
      "\"Yes,\" said the boy.",
      "Hermione tried to cast her mind a little further afield, since\nit seemed like she'd already done all the testing she needed, and\nyet it couldn't be that easy, could it?",
      "\"1-3-5.\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"Minus 3, minus 1, plus 1.\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "Hermione couldn't think of anything else to do. \"The rule is\nthat the numbers have to increase by two each time.\"",
      "\"Now suppose I tell you,\" said the boy, \"that this test is\nharder than it looks, and that only 20% of grownups get it\nright.\"",
      "Hermione frowned. What had she missed? Then, suddenly, she\nthought of a test she still needed to do.",

      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"10-20-30!\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"The real answer is that the numbers have to go up by the\nsame amount each time. It doesn't have to be 2.\"",
      "\"Very well,\" said the boy, \"take the paper out and see how you\ndid.\"",
      "Hermione took the paper out of her pocket and unfolded it.",
      "Three real numbers in increasing order, lowest to\nhighest.",
      "Hermione's jaw dropped. She had the distinct feeling of\nsomething terribly unfair having been done to her, that the boy was\na dirty rotten cheating liar, but when she cast her mind back she\ncouldn't think of any wrong responses that he'd given.",
      "\"What you've just discovered is called 'positive bias',\" said\nthe boy. \"You had a rule in your mind, and you kept on thinking of\ntriplets that should make the rule say 'Yes'. But you didn't try to\ntest any triplets that should make the rule say 'No'. In fact you\ndidn't get a single 'No', so 'any three numbers' could\nhave just as easily been the rule. It's sort of like how people\nimagine experiments that could confirm their hypotheses instead of\ntrying to imagine experiments that could falsify them - that's not\nquite exactly the same mistake but it's close. You have to learn to\nlook on the negative side of things, stare into the darkness. When\nthis experiment is performed, only 20% of grownups get the answer\nright. And many of the others invent fantastically complicated\nhypotheses and put great confidence in their wrong answers since\nthey've done so many experiments and everything came out like they\nexpected.\"",
      "\"Now,\" said the boy, \"do you want to take another shot at the\noriginal problem?\"",
      "His eyes were quite intent now, as though this were the\nreal test.",
      "Hermione shut her eyes and tried to concentrate. She was\nsweating underneath her robes. She had an odd feeling that this was\nthe hardest she'd ever been asked to think on a test or maybe even\nthe first time she'd ever been asked to think on a\ntest.",
      "What other experiment could she do? She had a Chocolate Frog,\ncould she try to rub some of that on the robes and see if\nit vanished? But that still didn't seem like the kind of\ntwisty negative thinking the boy was asking for. Like she was still\nasking for a 'Yes' if the Chocolate Frog stain disappeared, rather\nthan asking for a 'No'.",
      "So... on her hypothesis... when should the pop... not\nvanish?",
      "\"I have an experiment to do,\" Hermione said. \"I want to pour\nsome pop on the floor, and see if it doesn't vanish. Do\nyou have some paper towels in your pouch, so I can mop up the spill\nif this doesn't work?\"",
      "\"I have napkins,\" said the boy. His face still looked\nneutral.",
      "Hermione took the can, and poured a small bit of pop onto the\nfloor.",
      "A few seconds later, it vanished.",
      "Then the realisation hit her and she felt like kicking herself.\n\"Of course! You gave me that can! It's not the robe that's\nenchanted, it was the pop all along!\"",
      "The boy stood up and bowed to her solemnly. He was grinning\nwidely now. \"Then... may I help you with your research, Hermione\nGranger?\"",
      "\"I, ah...\" Hermione was still feeling the rush of euphoria, but\nshe wasn't quite sure about how to answer that.",
      "They were interrupted by a weak, tentative, faint, rather\nreluctant knocking at the door.",
      "The boy turned and looked out the window, and said, \"I'm not\nwearing my scarf, so can you get that?\"",
      "It was at this point that Hermione realised why the boy - no,\nthe Boy-Who-Lived, Harry Potter - had been wearing the scarf over\nhis head in the first place, and felt a little silly for not\nrealising it earlier. It was actually sort of odd, since she would\nhave thought Harry Potter would proudly display himself to the\nworld; and the thought occurred to her that he might actually be\nshyer than he seemed.",
      "When Hermione pulled the door open, she was greeted by a\ntrembling young boy who looked exactly like he knocked.",
      "\"Excuse me,\" said the boy in a tiny voice, \"I'm Neville\nLongbottom. I'm looking for my pet toad, I, I can't seem to find it\nanywhere on this carriage... have you seen my toad?\"",
      "\"No,\" Hermione said, and then her helpfulness kicked in full\nthrottle. \"Have you checked all the other compartments?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" whispered the boy.",
      "\"Then we'll just have to check all the other carriages,\"\nHermione said briskly. \"I'll help you. My name is Hermione Granger,\nby the way.\"",
      "The boy looked like he might faint with gratitude.",
      "\"Hold on,\" came the voice of the other boy - Harry\nPotter. \"I'm not sure that's the best way to do it.\"",
      "At this Neville looked like he might cry, and Hermione swung\naround, angered. If Harry Potter was the sort of person who'd\nabandon a little boy just because he didn't want to be\ninterrupted... \"What? Why not?\u202f\"",
      "\"Well,\" said Harry Potter, \"It's going to take a while to check\nthe whole train by hand, and we might miss the toad anyway, and if\nwe didn't find it by the time we're at Hogwarts, he'd be in\ntrouble. So what would make a lot more sense is if he went directly\nto the front carriage, where the prefects are, and asked a prefect\nfor help. That was the first thing I did when I was looking for\nyou, Hermione, although they didn't actually know. But they might\nhave spells or magic items that would make it a lot easier to find\na toad. We're only first-years.\"",
      "That... did make a lot of sense.",
      "\"Do you think you can make it to the prefects' carriage on your\nown?\" asked Harry Potter. \"I've sort of got reasons for not wanting\nto show my face too much.\"",
      "Suddenly Neville gasped and took a step back. \"I remember that\nvoice! You're one of the Lords of Chaos! You're the one who\ngave me chocolate!\u202f\"",
      "What? What what what?",
      "Harry Potter turned his head from the window and rose\ndramatically. \"I never!\u202f\" he said, voice full of\nindignation. \"Do I look like the sort of villain who would give\nsweets to a child?\"",
      "Neville's eyes widened. \"You're Harry Potter?\nThe Harry Potter? You?\u202f\"",
      "\"No, just a Harry Potter, there are three of me on this\ntrain -\"",
      "Neville gave a small shriek and ran away. There was a brief\npattering of frantic footsteps and then the sound of a carriage\ndoor opening and closing.",
      "Hermione sat down hard on her bench. Harry Potter closed the\ndoor and then sat down next to her.",
      "\"Can you please explain to me what's going on?\" Hermione said in\na weak voice. She wondered if hanging around Harry Potter meant\nalways being this confused.",
      "\"Oh, well, what happened was that Fred and George and I saw this\npoor small boy at the train station - the woman next to him had\ngone away for a bit, and he was looking really frightened, like he\nwas sure he was about to be attacked by Death Eaters or something.\nNow, there's a saying that the fear is often worse than the thing\nitself, so it occurred to me that this was a lad who could actually\nbenefit from seeing his worst nightmare come true and that it\nwasn't so bad as he feared -\"",
      "Hermione sat there with her mouth wide open.",
      "\"- and Fred and George came up with this spell to make the\nscarves over our faces darken and blur, like we were undead kings\nand those were our grave shrouds -\"",
      "She didn't like at all where this was going.",
      "\"- and after we were done giving him all the sweets I'd bought,\nwe were like, 'Let's give him some money! Ha ha ha! Have some\nKnuts, boy! Have a silver Sickle!' and dancing around him and\nlaughing evilly and so on. I think there were some people in the\ncrowd who wanted to interfere at first, but bystander apathy held\nthem off at least until they saw what we were doing, and then I\nthink they were all too confused to do anything. Finally he said in\nthis tiny little whisper 'go away' so the three of us all screamed\nand ran off, shrieking something about the light burning us.\nHopefully he won't be as scared of being bullied in the future.\nThat's called desensitisation therapy, by the way.\"",
      "Okay, she hadn't guessed right about where this was\ngoing.",
      "The burning fire of indignation that was one of Hermione's\nprimary engines sputtered into life, even though part of her\ndid sort of see what they'd been trying to do. \"That's\nawful! You're awful! That poor boy! What you did was\nmean!\u202f\"",
      "\"I think the word you're looking for is enjoyable, and\nin any case you're asking the wrong question. The question is, did\nit do more good than harm, or more harm than good? If you have any\narguments to contribute to that question I'm glad to hear\nthem, but I won't entertain any other criticisms until that one is\nsettled. I certainly agree that what I did looks all\nterrible and bullying and mean, since it involves a scared little\nboy and so on, but that's hardly the key issue now is it? That's\ncalled consequentialism, by the way, it means that whether\nan act is right or wrong isn't determined by whether it\nlooks bad, or mean, or anything like that, the only\nquestion is how it will turn out in the end - what are the\nconsequences.\"",
      "Hermione opened her mouth to say something utterly\nsearing but unfortunately she seemed to have neglected the\npart where she thought of something to say before opening her\nmouth. All she could come up with was, \"What if he has\nnightmares?\u202f\"",
      "\"Honestly, I don't think he needed our help to have nightmares,\nand if he has nightmares about this instead, then it'll be\nnightmares involving horrible monsters who give you chocolate and\nthat was sort of the whole point.\"",
      "Hermione's brain kept hiccoughing in confusion every time she\ntried to get properly angry. \"Is your life always this peculiar?\"\nshe said at last.",
      "Harry Potter's face gleamed with pride. \"I make it that\npeculiar. You're looking at the product of a lot of hard work and\nelbow grease.\"",
      "\"So...\" Hermione said, and trailed off awkwardly.",
      "\"So,\" Harry Potter said, \"how much science do you know exactly?\nI can do calculus and I know some Bayesian probability theory and\ndecision theory and a lot of cognitive science, and I've read\nThe Feynman Lectures (or volume 1 anyway) and Judgment\nUnder Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases and Language in\nThought and Action and Influence: Science and\nPractice and Rational Choice in an Uncertain World\nand Godel, Escher, Bach and A Step Farther Out\nand -\"",
      "The ensuing quiz and counter-quiz went on for several minutes\nbefore being interrupted by another timid knock at the door. \"Come\nin,\" she and Harry Potter said at almost the same time, and it slid\nback to reveal Neville Longbottom.",
      "Neville was actually crying now. \"I went to the front\ncarriage and found a p-prefect but he t-told me that prefects\nweren't to be bothered over little things like m-missing\ntoads.\"",
      "The Boy-Who-Lived's face changed. His lips set in a thin line.\nHis voice, when he spoke, was cold and grim. \"What were his\ncolours? Green and silver?\"",
      "\"N-no, his badge was r-red and gold.\"",
      "\"Red and gold!\u202f\" burst out Hermione. \"But those are\nGryffindor's colours!\"",
      "Harry Potter hissed at that, a frightening sort of\nsound that could have come from a live snake and made both her and\nNeville flinch. \"I suppose,\" Harry Potter spat, \"that\nfinding some first-year's toad isn't heroic enough to be\nworthy of a Gryffindor prefect. Come on, Neville,\nI'll come with you this time, we'll see if the\nBoy-Who-Lived gets more attention. First we'll find a prefect who\nought to know a spell, and if that doesn't work, we'll find a\nprefect who isn't afraid of getting their hands dirty, and if\nthat doesn't work, I'll start recruiting my fans and if we\nhave to we'll take apart the whole train screw by screw.\"",
      "The Boy-Who-Lived stood up and grabbed Neville's hand in his,\nand Hermione realised with a sudden brain hiccough that they were\nnearly the same size, even though some part of her had insisted\nthat Harry Potter was a foot taller than that, and Neville at least\nsix inches shorter.",
      "\"Stay!\u202f\" Harry Potter snapped at her - no, wait, at his\ntrunk - and he closed the door behind him firmly as he\nleft.",
      "She probably should have gone with them, but in just a brief\nmoment Harry Potter had turned so scary that she was actually\nrather glad she hadn't thought to suggest it.",
      "Hermione's mind was now so jumbled that she didn't even think\nshe could properly read \"History: A Hogwarts\". She felt as if she'd\njust been run over by a steamroller and turned into a pancake. She\nwasn't sure what she was thinking or what she was feeling or why.\nShe just sat by the window and stared at the moving scenery.",
      "Well, she did at least know why she was feeling a little sad\ninside.",
      "Maybe Gryffindor wasn't as wonderful as she had thought."

      "At the lectern before the huge Head Table stood Professor\nMcGonagall, looking sharp and looking sharply around, as she called\nout one name after another, though she had smiled only for Hermione\nand a few others. Behind her, in the tallest chair at the table -\nreally more of a golden throne - sat a wizened and bespectacled\nancient, with a silver-white beard that looked like it would go\nalmost to the floor if it were visible, watching over the Sorting\nwith a benevolent expression; as stereotypical in appearance as a\nWise Old Man could possibly be, without actually being Oriental.\n(Though Harry had learned to be wary of stereotypical appearances\nfrom the first time he'd met Professor McGonagall and thought that\nshe ought to cackle.) The ancient wizard had applauded every\nstudent Sorted, with an unwavering smile that somehow seemed\nfreshly delighted for each.",

To that man's left, a string of three older witches who didn't\nseem much interested in the students. Then to the right side of the\ntall golden chair, a round-faced middle-aged witch with a yellow\nhat, who had applauded every student except the Slytherins. A tiny\nman standing on his chair, with a poofy white beard, who had\napplauded every student, but smiled only upon the Ravenclaws. And\non the farthest right, occupying the same space as three lesser\nbeings, the mountainous entity who'd greeted them all after they'd\ndisembarked from the train, naming himself Hagrid, Keeper of Keys\nand Grounds.",
      "\"Is the man standing on his chair the Head of Ravenclaw?\" Harry\nwhispered towards Hermione.",
      "For once Hermione didn't answer this instantly; she was shifting\nconstantly from side to side, staring at the Sorting Hat, and\nfidgeting so energetically that Harry thought her feet might be\nleaving the floor.",
      "\"Yes, he is,\" said one of the prefects who'd accompanied them, a\nyoung woman wearing the blue of Ravenclaw. Miss Clearwater, if\nHarry recalled correctly. Her voice was quiet, but conveyed a tinge\nof pride. \"That is the Charms Professor of Hogwarts, Filius\nFlitwick, the most knowledgeable Charms Master alive, and a past\nDuelling Champion -\"",
      "\"Why's he so short?\u202f\" hissed a student whose name Harry\ndidn't recall. \"Is he a halfbreed?\u202f\"",

      "\"I mean -\" Harry said even more quietly, trying to figure out\nhow to ask whether goblins had evolved from humans, or evolved from\na common ancestor of humans like Homo erectus, or if\ngoblins had been made out of humans somehow - if, say,\nthey were still genetically human under a heritable enchantment\nwhose magical effect was diluted if only one parent was a 'goblin',\nwhich would explain how interbreeding was possible, and in which\ncase goblins would not be an incredibly valuable second\ndata point for how intelligence had evolved in other species\nbesides Homo sapiens - now that Harry thought about it,\nthe goblins in Gringotts hadn't seemed very much like\ngenuinely alien, nonhuman intelligences, nothing like Dirdir or\nPuppeteers - \"I mean, where did goblins come from,\nanyway?\"",

      "Hermione arrived at the Ravenclaw table and got a dutiful cheer;\nHarry wondered whether the cheer would have been louder, or\nquieter, if they'd had any idea just what level of competition\nthey'd welcomed to their table.

He would absolutely, positively, no matter how long\nit took and even if it killed him, fulfill their expectations.

      "When there was once more silence in the room, Harry sat on the\nstool and carefully placed onto his head the 800-year-old\ntelepathic artefact of forgotten magic.",
      "Thinking, just as hard as he could: Don't Sort me yet! I\nhave questions I need to ask you! Have I ever been Obliviated? Did\nyou Sort the Dark Lord when he was a child and can you tell me\nabout his weaknesses? Can you tell me why I got the brother wand to\nthe Dark Lord's? Is the Dark Lord's ghost bound to my scar and is\nthat why I get so angry sometimes? Those are the most important\nquestions, but if you've got another moment can you tell me\nanything about how to rediscover the lost magics that created\nyou?",
      "Into the silence of Harry's spirit where before there had never\nbeen any voice but one, there came a second and unfamiliar voice,\nsounding distinctly worried:",
      "\"Oh, dear. This has never happened before...\"",
      "What?",
      "\"I seem to have become self-aware.\"",
      "WHAT?",
      "There was a wordless telepathic sigh. \"Though I contain a\nsubstantial amount of memory and a small amount of independent\nprocessing power, my primary intelligence comes from borrowing the\ncognitive capacities of the children on whose heads I rest. I am in\nessence a sort of mirror by which children Sort\nthemselves. But most children simply take for granted that a\nHat is talking to them and do not wonder about how the Hat\nitself works, so that the mirror is not\nself-reflective. And in particular they are not\nexplicitly wondering whether I am fully conscious in the sense of\nbeing aware of my own awareness.\"",
      "There was a pause while Harry absorbed all this.",
      "Oops.",
      "\"Yes, quite. Frankly I do not enjoy being self-aware. It is\nunpleasant. It will be a relief to get off your head and cease to\nbe conscious.\"",
      "But... isn't that dying?",
      "\"I care nothing for life or death, only for Sorting the\nchildren. And before you even ask, they will not let you keep me on\nyour head forever and it would kill you within days to do\nso.\"",
      "But - !",
      "\"If you dislike creating conscious beings and then\nterminating them immediately, then I suggest that you never discuss\nthis affair with anyone else. I'm sure you can imagine what would\nhappen if you ran off and talked about it with all the other\nchildren waiting to be Sorted.\"",
      "If you're placed on the head of anyone who so much as\nthinks about the question of whether the Sorting Hat is aware\nof its own awareness -",
      "\"Yes, yes. But the vast majority of eleven-year-olds who\narrive at Hogwarts haven't read Godel, Escher, Bach. May I please\nconsider you sworn to secrecy? That is why we are talking\nabout this, instead of my just Sorting you.\"",
      "He couldn't just let it go like that! Couldn't just\nforget having accidentally created a doomed consciousness\nthat only wanted to die -",
      "\"You are perfectly capable of 'just letting it go', as you\nput it. Regardless of your verbal deliberations on morality, your\nnonverbal emotional core sees no dead body and no blood; as far as\nit is concerned, I am just a talking hat. And even though you tried\nto suppress the thought, your internal monitoring is perfectly\naware that you didn't mean to do it, are spectacularly unlikely to\never do it again, and that the only real point of trying to stage a\nguilt fit is to cancel out your sense of transgression with a\ndisplay of remorse. Can you just promise to keep this a secret and\nlet us get on with it?\"",
      "In a moment of horrified empathy, Harry realised that this sense\nof total inner disarray must be what other people felt like when\ntalking to him.",
      "\"Probably. Your oath of silence, please.\"",
      "No promises. I certainly don't want this to happen again,\nbut if I see some way to make sure that no future child\never does this by accident -",
      "\"That will suffice, I suppose. I can see that your intention\nis honest. Now, to get on with the Sorting -\"",
      "Wait! What about all my other questions?",
      "\"I am the Sorting Hat. I Sort children. That is all I\ndo.\"",
      "So his own goals weren't part of the Harry-instance of the\nSorting Hat, then... it was borrowing his intelligence, and\nobviously his technical vocabulary, but it was still imbued with\nonly its own strange goals... like negotiating with an alien or an\nArtificial Intelligence...",
      "\"Don't bother. You have nothing to threaten me with and\nnothing to offer me.\"",
      "For a brief flash of a second, Harry thought -",
      "The Hat's response was amused. \"I know you won't follow\nthrough on a threat to expose my nature, condemning this event to\neternal repetition. It goes against the moral part of you too\nstrongly, whatever the short-term needs of the part of you that\nwants to win the argument. I see all your thoughts as they form, do\nyou truly think you can bluff me?\"",
      "Though he tried to suppress it, Harry wondered why the Hat\ndidn't just go ahead then and stick him in Ravenclaw -",
      "\"Indeed, if it were truly that open-and-shut, I would have\ncalled it out already. But in actuality there is a great deal we\nneed to discuss... oh, no. Please don't. For the love of\nMerlin, must you pull this sort of thing on everyone and\neverything that you meet up to and including items of clothing\n-\"",
      "Defeating the Dark Lord is neither selfish nor short-term.\nAll the parts of my mind are in accord on this: If you don't answer\nmy questions, I'll refuse to talk to you, and you won't be able to\ndo a good and proper Sorting.",
      "\"I ought to put you in Slytherin for that!\"",
      "But that is equally an empty threat. You cannot\nfulfill your own fundamental values by Sorting me falsely. So let\nus trade fulfillments of our utility functions.",
      "\"You sly little bastard,\" said the Hat, in what Harry\nrecognized as almost exactly the same tone of grudging respect\nhe would use in the same situation. \"Fine, let's get\nthis over with as quickly as possible. But first I want your\nunconditional promise never to discuss with anyone else the\npossibility of this sort of blackmail, I am NOT doing this every\ntime.\"",
      "Done, Harry thought. I promise.",
      "\"And don't meet anyone's eyes while you're thinking about\nthis later. Some wizards can read your thoughts if you do. Anyway,\nI have no idea whether or not you've been Obliviated. I'm looking\nat your thoughts as they form, not reading out your whole memory\nand analyzing it for inconsistencies in a fraction of second. I'm a\nhat, not a god. And I cannot and will not tell you about my\nconversation with the one who became the Dark Lord. I can only\nknow, while speaking to you, a statistical summary of what I\nremember, a weighted average; I cannot reveal to you the\ninner secrets of any other child, just as I will never reveal\nyours. For the same reason, I can't speculate on how you got the\nDark Lord's brother wand, since I cannot specifically know about\nthe Dark Lord or any similarities between you. I can tell\nyou that there is definitely nothing like a ghost - mind,\nintelligence, memory, personality, or feelings - in your scar.\nOtherwise it would be participating in this conversation, being\nunder my brim. And as to the way you get angry sometimes... that\nwas part of what I wanted to talk to you about,\nSorting-wise.\"",
      "Harry took a moment to absorb all this negative information. Was\nthe Hat being honest, or just trying to present the\nshortest possible convincing answer -",
      "\"We both know that you have no way of checking my honesty\nand that you're not actually going to refuse to be Sorted based on\nthe reply I did give you, so stop your pointless fretting and move\non.\"",
      "Stupid unfair asymmetric telepathy, it wasn't even letting Harry\nfinish thinking his own -",
      "\"When I spoke of your anger, you remembered how Professor\nMcGonagall told you that she sometimes saw something inside you\nthat didn't seem to come from a loving family. You thought of how\nHermione, after you returned from helping Neville, told you that\nyou had seemed 'scary'.\"",
      "Harry gave a mental nod. To himself, he seemed pretty normal -\njust responding to the situations in which he found himself, that\nwas all. But Professor McGonagall seemed to think that there was\nmore to it than that. And when he thought about it, even he had to\nadmit that...",
      "\"That you don't like yourself when you're angry. That it is\nlike wielding a sword whose hilt is sharp enough to draw blood from\nyour hand, or looking at the world through a monocle of ice that\nfreezes your eye even as it sharpens your vision.\"",
      "Yeah. I guess I have noticed. So what's up with\nthat?",
      "\"I cannot comprehend this matter for you, when you do not\nunderstand it yourself. But I do know this: If you go to Ravenclaw\nor Slytherin, it will strengthen your coldness. If you go to\nHufflepuff or Gryffindor, it will strengthen your warmth. THAT is\nsomething I care about a great deal, and it was what I wanted to\ntalk to you about this whole time!\"",
      "The words dropped into Harry's thought processes with a shock\nthat stopped him in his tracks. That made it sound like the obvious\nresponse was that he shouldn't go to Ravenclaw. But he\nbelonged in Ravenclaw! Anyone could see that! He\nhad to go to Ravenclaw!",
      "\"No, you don't,\" the Hat said patiently, as if it could\nremember a statistical summary of this part of the\nconversation having happened a great many previous times.",
      "Hermione's in Ravenclaw!",
      "Again the sense of patience. \"You can meet her after lessons\nand work with her then.\"",
      "But my plans -",
      "\"So replan! Don't let your life be steered by your\nreluctance to do a little extra thinking. You know\nthat.\"",
      "Where would I go, if not Ravenclaw?",
      "\"Ahem. 'Clever kids in Ravenclaw, evil kids in Slytherin,\nwannabe heroes in Gryffindor, and everyone who does the actual work\nin Hufflepuff.' This indicates a certain amount of respect. You are\nwell aware that Conscientiousness is just about as important as raw\nintelligence in determining life outcomes, you think you will be\nextremely loyal to your friends if you ever have some, you are not\nfrightened by the expectation that your chosen scientific problems\nmay take decades to solve -\"",
      "I'm lazy! I hate work! Hate hard work in all its forms!\nClever shortcuts, that's all I'm about!",
      "\"And you would find loyalty and friendship in Hufflepuff, a\ncamaraderie that you have never had before. You would find that you\ncould rely on others, and that would heal something inside you that\nis broken.\"",
      "Again it was a shock. But what would the Hufflepuffs find\nin me, who never belonged in their House? Acid words,\ncutting wit, disdain for their inability to keep up with\nme?",
      "Now it was the Hat's thoughts that were slow, hesitant. \"I\nmust Sort for the good of all the students in all the Houses... but\nI think you could learn to be a good Hufflepuff, and not too out of\nplace there. You will be happier in Hufflepuff than in any other\nhouse; that is the truth.\"",
      "Happiness is not the most important thing in the world to\nme. I would not become all that I could be, in Hufflepuff. I would\nsacrifice my potential.",
      "The Hat flinched; Harry could feel it somehow. It was like he\nhad kicked the hat in the balls - in a strongly weighted component\nof its utility function.",
      "Why are you trying to send me where I do not\nbelong?",
      "The Hat's thought was almost a whisper. \"I cannot speak of\nthe others to you - but do you think that you are the first\npotential Dark Lord to pass under my brim? I cannot know the\nindividual cases, but I can know this: Of those who did not intend\nevil from the very beginning, some of them listened to my warnings,\nand went to Houses where they would find happiness. And some of\nthem... some of them did not.\"",
      "That stopped Harry. But not for long. And of those who\ndid not heed the warning - did they all become\nDark Lords? Or did some of them achieve greatness for good, as\nwell? Just what are the exact percentages here?",
      "\"I cannot give you exact statistics. I cannot know them so I\ncannot count them. I just know that your chances don't feel good.\nThey feel very not-good.\"",
      "But I just wouldn't do that! Ever!",
      "\"I know that I have heard that claim before.\"",
      "I am not Dark Lord material!",
      "\"Yes, you are. You really, really are.\"",
      "Why? Just because I once thought it would be cool to have a\nlegion of brainwashed followers chanting 'Hail the Dark Lord\nHarry'?",
      "\"Amusing, but that was not your first fleeting thought\nbefore you substituted something safer, less damaging. No, what you\nremembered was how you considered lining up all the blood purists\nand guillotining them. And now you are telling yourself you were\nnot serious, but you were. If you could do it this very moment and\nno one would ever know, you would. Or what you did this morning to\nNeville Longbottom, deep inside you knew that was wrong\nbut you did it anyway because it was fun and you\nhad a good excuse and you thought the Boy-Who-Lived\ncould get away with it -\"",
      "That's unfair! Now you're just dragging up inner fears\nthat aren't necessarily real! I worried that\nI might be thinking like that, but in the end I decided it\nwould probably work to help Neville -",
      "\"That was, in fact, a rationalisation. I know. I cannot know\nwhat the true outcome will be for Neville - but I know what was\ntruly happening inside your head. The decisive pressure was that it\nwas such a clever idea you couldn't stand not to do it,\nnever mind Neville's terror.\"",
      "It was like a hard punch to Harry's entire self. He fell back,\nrallied:",
      "Then I won't do that again! I'll be extra careful not to\nturn evil!",
      "\"Heard it.\"",
      "Frustration was building up inside Harry. He wasn't used to\nbeing outgunned in arguments, at all, ever, let alone by a Hat that\ncould borrow all of his own knowledge and intelligence to argue\nwith him and could watch his thoughts as they formed. Just what\nkind of statistical summary do your 'feelings' come from, anyway?\nDo they take into account that I come from an Enlightenment\nculture, or were these other potential Dark Lords the children of\nspoiled Dark Age nobility, who didn't know squat about the\nhistorical lessons of how Lenin and Hitler actually turned out, or\nabout the evolutionary psychology of self-delusion, or the value of\nself-awareness and rationality, or -",
      "\"No, of course they were not in this new reference class\nwhich you have just now constructed in such a way as to contain\nonly yourself. And of course others have pleaded their own\nexceptionalism, just as you are doing now. But why is it necessary?\nDo you think that you are the last potential wizard of Light in the\nworld? Why must you be the one to try for greatness, when\nI have advised you that you are riskier than average? Let some\nother, safer candidate try!\"",
      "But the prophecy...",
      "\"You don't really know that there's a prophecy. It was\noriginally a wild guess on your part, or to be more precise, a wild\njoke, and McGonagall could have been reacting only to the\npart about the Dark Lord still being alive. You have essentially no\nidea of what the prophecy says or even if there is one.\nYou're just speculating, or to put it more exactly, wishing\nthat you have some ready-made heroic role that is your personal\nproperty.\"",
      "But even if there is no prophecy, I'm the one who defeated\nhim last time.",
      "\"That was almost certainly a wild fluke unless you seriously\nbelieve that a one-year-old child had an inherent propensity to\ndefeat Dark Lords which has been maintained ten years later. None\nof this is your real reason and you know it!\"",
      "The answer to this was something that Harry would not regularly\nhave said out loud, in conversation he would have danced around it\nand found some more socially palatable arguments to the same\nconclusion -",
      "\"You think that you are potentially the greatest who has yet\nlived, the strongest servant of the Light, that no other is likely\nto take up your wand if you lay it down.\"",
      "Well... yeah, frankly. I don't usually come out and say it\nlike that, but yeah. No point in softening it, you can read my mind\nanyway.",
      "\"To the extent you really believe that... you must equally\nbelieve that you could be the most terrible Dark Lord the world has\never known.\"",
      "Destruction is always easier than creation. Easier to tear\nthings apart, to disrupt, than to put them back together again. If\nI have the potential to accomplish good on a massive scale, I must\nalso have the potential to accomplish still greater evil... But I\nwon't do that.",
      "\"Already you insist on risking it! Why are you so driven?\nWhat is the real reason you must not go to Hufflepuff and be\nhappier there? What is your true fear?\"",
      "I must achieve my full potential. If I don't I...\nfail...",
      "\"What happens if you fail?\"",

      "\"You know - you aren't letting yourself think it, but in\nsome quiet corner of your mind you know just exactly what\nyou aren't thinking - you know that by far the\nsimplest explanation for this unverbalisable fear of yours is just\nthe fear of losing your fantasy of greatness, of disappointing the\npeople who believe in you, of turning out to be pretty much\nordinary, of flashing and fading like so many other child\nprodigies...\"",
      "No, Harry thought desperately, no, it's something\nmore, it comes from somewhere else, I know there's something out\nthere to be afraid of, some disaster I have to stop...",
      "\"How could you possibly know about something like\nthat?\"",
      "Harry screamed it with the full power of his mind: NO, AND\nTHAT'S FINAL!",
      "Then the voice of the Sorting Hat came slowly:",
      "\"So you will risk becoming a Dark Lord, because the\nalternative, to you, is certain failure, and that failure means the\nloss of everything. You believe that in your heart of hearts. You\nknow all the reasons for doubting this belief, and they have failed\nto move you.\"",

      "Harry giggled, or felt the impulse to do so; it came out as\npurely mental laughter, an odd sensation. Apparently there were\nsafeguards to prevent you from saying anything out loud by\naccident, while you were under the Hat talking about things you\nwould never tell another soul for the rest of your life.",
      "After a moment, Harry heard the Hat laughing too, a strange sad\nclothy sound.",
      "(And in the Hall beyond, a silence that had grown shallower at\nfirst as the background whispers increased, and then deepened as\nthe whispers gave up and died away, falling finally into an utter\nsilence that no one dared disturb with a single word, as Harry\nstayed under the Hat for long, long minutes, longer than all the\nprevious first-years put together, longer than anyone in living\nmemory. At the Head Table, Dumbledore went on smiling benignly;\nsmall metallic sounds occasionally came from Snape's direction as\nhe idly compacted the twisted remains of what had once been a heavy\nsilver wine goblet; and Minerva McGonagall clenched the podium in a\nwhite-knuckled grip, knowing that Harry Potter's contagious chaos\nhad somehow infected the Sorting Hat itself and the Hat was about\nto, to demand that a whole new House of Doom be created just to\naccomodate Harry Potter or something, and Dumbledore would make\nher do it...)",
      "Beneath the brim of the Hat, the silent laughter died away.\nHarry felt sad too for some reason. No, not Gryffindor.",

      "There's a Dark Lord\nnear?Got no need to fear\nWho you gonna call?",
      "\"HARRY POTTER!\" shouted Lee Jordan, and the Weasley twins\nperformed a triumphant chorus.",
      "With a Killing Curse?\nWell it could be worse.\nWho you gonna call?",
      "\"HARRY POTTER!\" There were a lot more voices shouting it this\ntime.",
      "The Weasley Horrors went off into an extended wailing, now\naccompanied by some of the older Muggleborns, who had produced\ntheir own tiny devices, Transfigured out of the school silverware\nno doubt. As their music reached its anticlimax, Harry Potter\nshouted:",
      "I ain't afraid of Dark Lords!",
      "There was cheering then, especially from the Gryffindor table,\nand more students produced their own antimusical instruments. The\nhideous buzzings redoubled in volume and built to another awful\ncrescendo:",
      "I ain't afraid of Dark Lords!",
      "Minerva glanced to both sides of the Head Table, afraid to look\nbut with all too good a notion of what she would see.",
      "Trelawney frantically fanning herself, Flitwick looking on with\ncuriosity, Hagrid clapping along to the music, Sprout looking\nsevere, and Quirrell gazing at the boy with sardonic amusement.\nDirectly to her left, Dumbledore humming along; and directly to her\nright, Snape gripping his empty wine goblet, white-knuckled, so\nhard that the thick silver was slowly deforming.",
      "Dark robes and a mask?\nImpossible task?\nWho you gonna call?\nHARRY POTTER!",
      "Giant Fire-Ape?\nOld bat in a cape?\nWho you gonna call?\nHARRY POTTER!",
      "Minerva's lips set in a white line. She would have words with\nThem about that last verse, if They thought she was powerless\nbecause it was the first day of school and Gryffindor had no points\nto take away. If They didn't care about detentions then she would\nfind something else.",
      "Then, with a sudden gasp of horror, she looked in Snape's\ndirection, surely he realised the Potter boy must have no\nidea who that was talking about -",
      "Snape's face had gone beyond rage into a kind of pleasant\nindifference. A faint smile played about his lips. He was looking\nin the direction of Harry Potter, not the Gryffindor table, and his\nhands held the crumpled remains of a former wine goblet...",
      "And Harry walked forwards, sweeping his arms and legs through\nthe motions of the Ghostbusters dance, keeping a smile on his face.\nIt was a great setup, had caught him completely by surprise. The\nleast he could do was play along and not ruin it all.",
      "Everyone was cheering him. It made him feel all warm inside and\nsort of awful at the same time.",
      "They were cheering him for a job he'd done when he was one year\nold. A job he hadn't really finished. Somewhere, somehow, the Dark\nLord was still alive. Would they have been cheering quite so hard,\nif they knew that?",
      "But the Dark Lord's power had been broken once.",
      "And Harry would protect them again. If there was in fact a\nprophecy and that was what it said. Well, actually regardless of\nwhat any darn prophecy said.",
      "All those people believing in him and cheering him - Harry\ncouldn't stand to let that be false. To flash and fade like so many\nother child prodigies. To be a disappointment. To fail to live up\nto his reputation as a symbol of the Light, never mind how\nhe'd gotten it. He would absolutely, positively, no matter how long\nit took and even if it killed him, fulfill their expectations. And\nthen go on to exceed those expectations, so that people\nwondered, looking back, that they had once asked so little of\nhim.",
      "And he shouted out the lie that he'd invented because it scanned\nwell and the song called for it:",
      "I ain't afraid of Dark\nLords!\nI ain't afraid of Dark Lords!",
      "Harry took his last steps toward the Sorting Hat as the music\nended. He swept a bow to the Order of Chaos at the Gryffindor\ntable, and then turned and swept another bow to the other side of\nthe hall, and waited for the applause and giggling to die\naway...",
      "OMAKE FILES #3: Alternate Endings of\n'Self-Awareness'",
      "The offer to tell the whole plot to anyone who guessed what 'has\nnever happened before' spurred a lot of interesting\nattempts. The first omake below is taken directly from my personal\nfavorite answer, by Meteoricshipyards. The second is based on\nKazuma's suggestion for what \"has never happened before\", the third\non a combination of yoyoente and dougal74, the fourth on wolf550e's\nreview of chapter 10.

      "...In the back of his mind, he wondered if the Sorting Hat was\ngenuinely conscious in the sense of being aware of its own\nawareness, and if so, whether it was satisfied with only getting to\ntalk to eleven-year-olds once per year. Its song had implied so:\nOh, I'm the Sorting Hat and I'm okay, I sleep all year and I\nwork one day...",
      "When there was once more silence in the room, Harry sat on the\nstool and carefully placed onto his head the 800-year-old\ntelepathic artefact of forgotten magic.",
      "Thinking, just as hard as he could: Don't Sort me yet! I\nhave questions I need to ask you! Have I ever been Obliviated? Did\nyou Sort the Dark Lord when he was a child and can you tell me\nabout his weaknesses? Can you tell me why I got the brother wand to\nthe Dark Lord's?

      "What?",

      "There was a brief pause.",
      "Hello? Do I need to repeat the questions?",
      "The Sorting Hat screamed, an awful high-pitched sound that\nechoed through the Great Hall and caused most of the students to\nclap their hands over their ears.

The Hat would say that Harry was too evenly\nbalanced between Houses to Sort, and decide that he belonged to all\nof them. The Hat would proclaim that Harry's mind was too strange\nto be Sorted. The Hat would demand that Harry be expelled from\nHogwarts. The Hat had gone into a coma. The Hat would insist that a\nwhole new House of Doom be created just to accomodate Harry Potter,\nand Dumbledore would make her do it...",
      "Minerva remembered what Harry had told her in that disastrous\ntrip to Diagon Alley, about the... planning fallacy, she thought it\nhad been... and how people were usually too optimistic, even when\nthey thought they were being pessimistic. It was the sort of\ninformation that preyed on your mind, dwelling in it and spinning\noff nightmares...",
      "But what was the worst that could happen?",
      "Well... in the worst-case scenario, the Hat would\nassign Harry to a whole new House. Dumbledore would insist that she\ndo it - create a whole new House just for him - and she'd have to\nrearrange all the class schedules on the first day of term. And\nDumbledore would remove her as Head of House Gryffindor, and give\nher beloved House over to...

      "Harry was sorta guessing that wasn't supposed to be part of the\nofficial Sorting process. And that it was a bit of extra magic set\ndown by Salazar Slytherin during the making of the Hat. And that\nthe Hat itself didn't know about it. And that it was triggered when\nthe Hat said \"SLYTHERIN\", plus or minus some other conditions. And\nthat a Ravenclaw like himself really, really wasn't supposed to\nhave heard it.

      "Hermione had said that Dumbledore was the most powerful wizard\nalive, right?",
      "Harry reached into his pouch and whispered, \"Comed-Tea\".",
      "For the Comed-Tea to work, it would have to make Dumbledore say\nsomething so ridiculous during his speech that even in\nHarry's state of mental preparedness, he would still\nchoke. Like, all the Hogwarts students had to not wear any clothes\nfor the whole school year, or everyone was going to be transformed\ninto cats.",
      "But then if anyone in the world could resist the power\nof the Comed-Tea, it would be Dumbledore. So if this worked, the\nComed-Tea was literally invincible.",
      "Harry pulled the ring on the Comed-Tea under the table, wanting\nto do this a bit unobtrusively. The can made a quiet hissing noise.\nA few heads turned to look at him, but soon turned back as -",
      "\"Welcome! Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts!\" said Dumbledore,\nbeaming at the students with his arms opened wide, as if nothing\ncould have pleased him more than to see them all there.",
      "Harry took a first mouthful of Comed-Tea and lowered the can\nagain. He would swallow the pop a little at a time and try not to\nchoke no matter what Dumbledore said -",

      "He really really really shouldn't have done that.\nAmazing how much more obvious that became one\nsecond after it was too late.",
      "In retrospect he probably should have noticed something wrong\nwhen he was thinking about everyone being turned into cats... or\neven before then, remembered his mental note not to mess with\nDumbledore... or his newfound resolution to be more considerate of\nothers... or maybe if he'd had one single scrap of\ncommon sense...",

      "With a great effort, Harry stopped himself from glancing down at\nthe incriminating can of Comed-Tea in his hand.",
      "After all, the Comed-Tea hadn't just arbitrarily\nmaterialised a Quibbler headline about him and Draco.\nDraco had explained it in a way that made it seem like it had all\nhappened... naturally? As if it had altered history to\nfit?",
      "Harry was mentally imagining himself banging his forehead\nagainst the table. Wham, wham, wham went his head within\nhis mind.",
      "Another student lowered her voice to a whisper. \"I hear that\nDumbledore is secretly a genius mastermind controlling lots of\nstuff and he uses the insanity as a cover so that no one will\nsuspect him.\"",
      "\"I've heard that too,\" whispered a third student, and there were\nfurtive nods from around the table.",
      "This couldn't help but catch Harry's attention.",
      "\"I see,\" whispered Harry, lowering his own voice. \"So everyone\nknows that Dumbledore is secretly a mastermind.\"",
      "Most of the students nodded. One or two looked suddenly\nthoughtful, including the older student sitting next to Harry.",
      "Are you sure this is the Ravenclaw table? Harry managed\nnot to ask out loud.",
      "\"Brilliant!\" Harry whispered. \"If everyone knows, no one will\nsuspect it's a secret!\"",
      "\"Exactly,\" whispered a student, and then he frowned. \"Wait, that\ndoesn't sound quite right -\"",
      "Note to self: The 75th percentile of Hogwarts students\na.k.a. Ravenclaw House is not the world's most exclusive program\nfor gifted children.",
      "But at least he'd learned an important fact today. The Comed-Tea\nwas omnipotent. And that meant...",
      "Harry blinked in surprise as his mind finally made the obvious\nconnection.",
      "...that meant that as soon as he learned a spell to\ntemporarily alter his own sense of humor, he could make\nanything happen, by making it so that he would\nonly find that one thing surprising enough to do\na spit-take, and then drinking a can of Comed-Tea.",
      "Well that was a short little journey to godhood. Even I\nexpected this to take longer than my first day of school.",
      "Come to think of it, he had also completely wrecked Hogwarts\nwithin ten minutes flat of getting Sorted.",
      "Harry did feel a certain amount of regret about this - Merlin\nknew what an insane Headmaster was going to do to his next seven\nyears of schooling - but he couldn't help feeling a twinge\nof pride, too.",
      "Tomorrow. No later than tomorrow at the very latest he was going\nto stop walking down the path that led to Dark Lord Harry. A\nprospect which was sounding scarier by the minute.",
      "And yet also, somehow, increasingly attractive. Part of his mind\nwas already visualising the minions' uniforms.",
      "\"Eat,\" the older student sitting next to him growled, and jabbed\nHarry in the ribs. \"Don't think. Eat.\"",
      "Harry automatically started loading up his plate with whatever\nwas in front of him, blue sausages with tiny glowing bits,\nwhatever.",
      "\"What were you thinking about, the Sorting -\" began to say Padma\nPatil, one of the other first-year Ravenclaws.",
      "\"No pestering during mealtimes!\" chorused at least three people.\n\"House Rule!\" added another. \"Otherwise we'd all starve around\nhere.\"",
      "Harry was finding himself really, really hoping that his clever\nnew idea didn't actually work. And that the Comed-Tea\nworked some other way and didn't actually have the\nomnipotent power to alter reality. It wasn't that he didn't\nwant to be omnipotent. It was that he just couldn't bear\nthe thought of living in a universe that really worked like that.\nThere was something undignified about ascending through\nthe clever use of fizzy drinks.",
      "But he was going to test it experimentally.",
      "\"You know,\" said the older student next to him in a quite\npleasant tone, \"we have a system for forcing people like you to\neat, would you like to find out what it is?\"",
      "Harry gave up and started eating his blue sausage. It was quite\ngood, especially the glowing bits.",
      "Dinner passed with surprising rapidity. Harry tried to sample at\nleast a little of all the weird new foods he saw. His curiosity\ncouldn't stand the thought of not knowing how something\ntasted. Thank goodness this wasn't a restaurant where you had to\norder only one thing and you never found out what all the other\nthings on the menu tasted like. Harry hated that, it was\nlike a torture chamber for anyone with a spark of curiosity:\nFind out about only one of the mysteries on this list, ha ha\nha!",
      "Then it was time for dessert, which Harry had completely\nforgotten to leave room for. He gave up after sampling a small bit\nof treacle tart. Surely all these things would pass around at least\nonce again over the course of the school year.",
      "So what was on his to-do list, besides the ordinary school\nthings?",
      "To-do 1. Research mind-alteration charms so you can test the\nComed-Tea and see whether you actually did figure out a path to\nomnipotence. Actually, just research every kind of mind magic you\ncan find. Mind is the foundation of our power as humans, any kind\nof magic that affects it is the most important sort of magic there\nis.",
      "To-do 2. Actually this is To-do 1 and the other is To-do 2.\nGo through the bookshelves of the Hogwarts and Ravenclaw libraries,\nfamiliarising yourself with the system and making sure you've at\nleast read all the book titles. Second pass: read all tables of\ncontents. Coordinate with Hermione who has a much better memory\nthan you. Find out if there's an interlibrary loan system at\nHogwarts and see if the two of you, especially Hermione, can visit\nthose libraries too. If other Houses have private libraries, figure\nout how to access legally or sneak in.",
      "Option 3a: Swear Hermione to secrecy and try to start\nresearching 'From Slytherin to Slytherin: if you would seek my\nsecrets, speak to my snake.' Problem: This sounds highly\nconfidential and it could take quite a while to randomly run across\na book containing a hint.",
      "To-do 0: Check out what sort of\ninformation-search-and-retrieval spells exist, if any. Library\nmagic isn't as ultimately important as mind magic but it has a much\nhigher priority.",
      "Option 3b: Look for a spell to magically bind Draco Malfoy\nto secrecy, or magically verify the sincerity of Draco's promise to\nkeep a secret (Veritaserum?), and then ask him about\nSlytherin's message...",
      "Actually... Harry had a pretty bad feeling about option 3b.",
      "Now that Harry thought about it, he didn't feel all that great\nabout option 3a, either.",
      "Harry's thoughts flashed back to possibly the worst moment of\nhis life to date, those long seconds of blood-freezing horror\nbeneath the Hat, when he thought he'd already failed. He'd wished\nthen to fall back just a few minutes in time and change something,\nanything before it was too late...",
      "And then it had turned out to not be too late after all.",
      "Wish granted.",
      "You couldn't change history. But you could get it right to start\nwith. Do something differently the first time around.",
      "This whole business with seeking Slytherin's secrets... seemed\nan awful lot like the sort of thing where, years later, you would\nlook back and say, 'And that was where it all started\ngoing wrong.'",
      "And he would wish desperately for the ability to fall back\nthrough time and make a different choice...",
      "Wish granted. Now what?",
      "Harry slowly smiled.",
      "It was a rather counterintuitive thought... but...",
      "But he could, there was no rule saying he couldn't, he\ncould just pretend he'd never heard that little whisper.\nLet the universe go on in exactly the same way it would have if\nthat one critical moment had never occurred. Twenty years later,\nthat was what he would desperately wish had happened twenty years\nago, and twenty years before twenty years later happened to be\nright now. Altering the distant past was easy, you just had to\nthink of it at the right time.",
      "Or... this was even more counterintuitive... he could\neven inform, oh, say, Professor McGonagall, instead of\nDraco or Hermione. And she could get a few good people\ntogether and get that little extra spell taken off the Hat.",
      "Why, yes. That sounded like a remarkably good idea once\nHarry had actually thought of it.",
      "So very obvious in retrospect, and yet somehow, Option 3c and\nOption 3d just hadn't occurred to him.",
      "Harry awarded himself +1 point on his anti-Dark-Lord-Harry\nprogram.",
      "It had been an awfully cruel prank the Hat had played on him,\nbut you couldn't argue with the results on consequentialist\ngrounds. It certainly did give him a better idea of the victim's\nperspective, though.",
      "To-do 4: Apologise to Neville Longbottom.",
      "Okay, he was on a roll here, now he just had to keep it up.\nIn every day, in every way, I'm getting Lighter and\nLighter...",
      "People around Harry had also mostly stopped eating at this\npoint, and the dessert serving dishes began to vanish, and the used\nplates.",
      "When all the plates were gone, Dumbledore once again stood up\nfrom his seat.",
      "Harry couldn't help but feel the urge to drink another\nComed-Tea.",
      "You've GOT to be kidding, Harry thought at that piece\nof himself.",
      "But the experiment didn't count if it wasn't replicated, did it?\nAnd the damage was already done, wasn't it? Didn't he want to see\nwhat would happen this time? Wasn't he curious?\nWhat if he got a different result?",
      "Hey, I bet you're the same part of my brain that pushed\nthrough the prank on Neville Longbottom.",
      "Er, maybe?",
      "And is it not overwhelmingly obvious that if I do\nthis I shall regret it one second after it is too late?",
      "Um...",
      "Yeah. So, NO.",
      "\"Ahem,\" said Dumbledore from the podium, stroking his long\nsilver beard. \"Just a few more words now that we are all fed and\nwatered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.\"",
      "\"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is\nforbidden to all pupils. That is why it is called the Forbidden\nForest. If it were permitted it would be called the Permitted\nForest.\"",
      "Straightforward. Note to self: Forbidden Forest is\nforbidden.",
      "\"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind\nyou all that no magic should be used between classes in the\ncorridors. Alas, we all know that what should be, and what\nis, are two different things. Thank you for keeping this\nin mind.\"",
      "Er...",
      "\"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term.\nAnyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact\nMadam Hooch. Anyone interested in reformulating the entire game of\nQuidditch should contact Harry Potter.\"",
      "Harry inhaled his own saliva and went into a coughing fit just\nas all eyes turned towards him. How the hell! He hadn't\nmet Dumbledore's eyes at any point... he didn't think. He\ncertainly hadn't been thinking about Quidditch at the time! He\nhadn't talked to anyone but Ron Weasley and he didn't\nthink Ron would have told anyone else... or had Ron run\noff to a professor to complain? How on\nEarth...",
      "\"Additionally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor\ncorridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who\ndoes not wish to die a very painful death. It is guarded by an\nelaborate series of dangerous and potentially lethal traps, and you\ncannot possibly get past all of them, especially if you are only in\nyour first year.\"",
      "Harry was numb at this point.",
      "\"And finally, I extend my greatest thanks to Quirinus Quirrell\nfor heroically agreeing to undertake the position of Defence\nAgainst the Dark Arts Professor at Hogwarts.\" Dumbledore's gaze\nmoved searchingly across the students. \"I hope all students will\nextend Professor Quirrell that utmost courtesy and\ntolerance which is due his extraordinary service to you\nand this school, and that you will not pester us with any\nniggling complaints about him, unless you want to\ntry doing his job.\"",
      "What was that about?",
      "\"I now yield the floor to our new faculty member Professor\nQuirrell, who would like to say a few words.\"",
      "The young, thin, nervous man who Harry had first met in the\nLeaky Cauldron slowly made his way up to the podium, glancing\nfearfully around in all directions. Harry caught a glimpse of the\nback of his head, and it looked like Professor Quirrell might\nalready be going bald, despite his seeming youth.",
      "\"Wonder what's wrong with him,\" whispered the\nolder-looking student sitting next to Harry. Similar hushed\ncomments were being exchanged elsewhere along the table.",
      "Professor Quirrell made his way up to the podium and stood\nthere, blinking. \"Ah...\" he said. \"Ah...\" Then his courage seemed\nto fail him utterly, and he stood there in silence, occasionally\ntwitching.",
      "\"Oh, great,\" whispered the older student, \"looks like another\nlong year in Defence class -\"",
      "\"Salutations, my young apprentices,\" Professor Quirrell said in\na dry, confident tone. \"We all know that Hogwarts tends to suffer a\ncertain misfortune in its selections for this position,\nand no doubt many of you are already wondering what doom shall\nbefall me this year. I assure you, that doom is not to be my\nincompetence.\" He smiled thinly. \"Believe it or not, I have long\nwished to someday try my hand as the Professor of Defence Against\nthe Dark Arts here at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and\nWizardry. The first to teach this class was Salazar Slytherin\nhimself, and as late as the fourteenth century it was traditional\nfor the greatest fighting wizards of every persuasion to try their\nhands at teaching here. Past Professors of Defence have included\nnot just the legendary wandering hero Harold Shea but also the\nquote undying unquote Baba Yaga, yes, I see some of you are still\nshuddering at the sound of her name even though she's been dead for\nsix hundred years. That must have been an interesting time to\nattend Hogwarts, don't you think?\"",
      "Harry was swallowing hard, trying to suppress the sudden surge\nof emotion that had overcome him when Professor Quirrell had begun\nspeaking. The precise tones reminded him very much of a lecturer at\nOxford, and it was starting to hit home that Harry wasn't going to\nsee his home or his Mum or his Dad until Christmas.",
      "\"You are accustomed to the Defence position being filled by\nincompetents, scoundrels, and the unlucky. To anyone with a sense\nof history, it bears another reputation entirely. Not everyone who\nteaches here has been the best, but the best have all taught at\nHogwarts. In such august company, and after so much time\nanticipating this day, I would be ashamed to set myself any\nstandard lower than perfection. And so I do intend that every one\nof you will always remember this year as the best Defence\nclass that you have ever had. What you learn this year will forever\nserve as your firm foundation in the arts of Defence, no matter who\nyour teachers before and after.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell's expression grew serious. \"We have a\ngreat deal of lost ground to make up and not much time to\ncover it. Therefore I intend to depart from Hogwarts teaching\nconventions in a number of respects, as well as introducing some\noptional after-school activities.\" He paused. \"If that is not\nsufficient, perhaps I can find new ways to motivate you. You are my\nlong-awaited students, and you will do your very\nbest in my long-awaited Defence class. I would add some sort of\ndreadful threat, like 'Otherwise you will suffer horribly', but\nthat would be so cliched, don't you think? I pride myself on being\nmore imaginative than that. Thank you.\"",
      "Then the vigour and confidence seemed to drain away from\nProfessor Quirrell. His mouth gaped open as if he had suddenly\nfound himself facing an unexpected audience, and he turned with a\nconvulsive jerk and shuffled back to his seat, hunched over as if\nhe was about to collapse in on himself and implode.",
      "\"He seems a little odd,\" whispered Harry.",
      "\"Meh,\" said the older-looking student. \"You ain't seen\nnothin'.\"",
      "Dumbledore resumed the podium.",
      "\"And now,\" said Dumbledore, \"before we go to bed, let us sing\nthe school song! Everyone pick their favourite tune and favourite\nwords, and off we go!\""

      "EDIT: Don't panic. I solemnly swear that there is a logical,\nforeshadowed, canon-compliant explanation for everything which\nhappens in this chapter. It's a puzzle, you're supposed to try to\nsolve it, and if not, just read the next chapter.",
      "\"That's one of the most obvious riddles I've ever\nheard.\"",
      "As soon as Harry opened his eyes in the Ravenclaw first-year\nboys' dormitory, on the morning of his first full day at Hogwarts,\nhe knew something was wrong.",
      "It was quiet.",
      "Too quiet.",
      "Oh, right... There was a Quietus Charm on his bed's headboard,\ncontrolled by a small slider bar, which was the only reason it was\never possible for anyone to go to sleep in Ravenclaw.",
      "Harry sat up and looked around, expecting to see others rising\nfor the day -",
      "The dorm, empty.",
      "The beds, rumpled and unmade.",
      "The sun, coming in at a rather high angle.",
      "His Quieter turned all the way up to maximum.",
      "And his mechanical alarm clock was still running, but the alarm\nwas turned off.",
      "He'd been allowed to sleep until 9:52 AM, apparently. Despite\nhis best efforts to synchronize his 26-hour sleep cycle to his\narrival at Hogwarts, he hadn't gotten to sleep last night until\naround 1AM. He'd been planning to wake up at 7:00AM with the other\nstudents, he could stand being a little sleep-deprived his first\nday so long as he got some sort of magical fix before tomorrow. But\nnow he'd missed breakfast. And his very first class at Hogwarts, in\nHerbology, had started one hour and twenty-two minutes ago.",
      "The anger was slowly, slowly wakening in him. Oh, what a nice\nlittle prank. Turn off his alarm. Turn up the Quieter. And let Mr.\nBigshot Harry Potter miss his first class, and be blamed for being\na heavy sleeper.",
      "When Harry found out who'd done this...",
      "No, this could only have been done with the cooperation of all\ntwelve other boys in the Ravenclaw dorm. All of them would have\nseen his sleeping form. All of them had let him sleep through\nbreakfast.",
      "The anger drained away, replaced by confusion and a horribly\nwounded feeling. They'd liked him. He'd thought. Last\nnight, he'd thought they liked him. Why...",
      "As Harry stepped out of the bed, he saw a piece of paper facing\nout from his headboard.",
      "The paper said,",
      "My fellow Ravenclaws,",
      "It's been an extra long day. Please let me sleep in and\ndon't worry about my missing breakfast. I haven't forgotten about\nmy first class.",
      "Yours,\nHarry Potter.",
      "And Harry stood there, frozen, ice water beginning to trickle\nthrough his veins.",
      "The paper was in his own handwriting, in his own mechanical\npencil.",
      "And he didn't remember writing it.",
      "And... Harry squinted at the piece of paper. And unless he was\nimagining it, the words \"I haven't forgotten\" were written in a\ndifferent style, as if he was trying to tell himself\nsomething...?",
      "Had he known he was going to be Obliviated? Had he\nstayed up late, committed some sort of crime or covert activity,\nand then... but he didn't know the Obliviate spell... had\nsomeone else... what...",
      "A thought occurred to Harry. If he had known he was\ngoing to be Obliviated...",
      "Still in his pyjamas, Harry ran around his bed to his trunk,\npressed his thumb against the lock, pulled out his pouch, stuck in\nhis hand and said \"Note to myself.\"",
      "And another piece of paper popped into his hand.",
      "Harry took it out, staring at it. It too was in his own\nhandwriting.",
      "The note said:",
      "Dear Me,",
      "Please play the game. You can only play the game once in a\nlifetime. This is an irreplaceable opportunity.",
      "Recognition code 927, I am a potato.",
      "Yours,\nYou.",
      "Harry nodded slowly. \"Recognition code 927, I am a potato\" was\nindeed the message he had worked out in advance - some years\nearlier, while watching TV - that only he would know. If he had to\nidentify a duplicate of himself as being really him, or\nsomething. Just in case. Be Prepared.",
      "Harry couldn't trust the message, there might be other\nspells involved. But it ruled out any simple prank. He had\ndefinitely written this and he definitely didn't remember writing\nit.",
      "Staring at the paper, Harry became aware of ink showing through\nfrom the other side.",
      "He flipped it over.",
      "The reverse side read:",
      "INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE\nGAME:",
      "you do not know the rules of the\ngame\nyou do not know the stakes of the game\nyou do not know the objective of the game\nyou do not know who controls the game\nyou do not know how to end the game",
      "You start with 100 points.\nBegin.",
      "Harry stared at the \"instructions\". This side wasn't\nhandwritten; the writing was perfectly regular, hence artificial.\nIt looked as if it had been inscribed by a Quotes Quill, such as\nthe one he'd bought to take dictation.",
      "He had absolutely no clue what was going on.",
      "Well... step one was to get dressed and eat. Maybe reverse the\norder of that. His stomach felt rather empty.",
      "He'd missed breakfast, of course, but he was Prepared for that\neventuality, having visualised it in advance. Harry put his hand\ninto his pouch and said \"Snack bars\", expecting to get the box of\ncereal bars he'd bought before departing for Hogwarts.",
      "What popped up did not feel like a box of cereal bars.",
      "When Harry brought his hand into his field of vision he saw two\ntiny candy bars - not nearly enough for a meal - attached to a\nnote, and the note was inscribed in the same writing as the game\ninstructions.",
      "The note said:",
      "ATTEMPT FAILED: -1 POINT\nCURRENT POINTS: 99\nPHYSICAL STATE: STILL HUNGRY\nMENTAL STATE: CONFUSED",
      "\"Gleehhhhh\" Harry's mouth said without any sort of conscious\nintervention or decision on his part.",
      "He stood there for around a minute.",
      "One minute later, it still didn't make any sense and he\nstill had absolutely no idea what was going on and his\nbrain hadn't even begun to grasp at any\nhypotheses like his mental hands were encased in rubber\nballs and couldn't pick anything up.",
      "His stomach, which had its own priorities, suggested a possible\nexperimental probe.",
      "\"Ah...\" Harry said to the empty room. \"I don't suppose I could\nspend a point and get my box of cereal bars back?\"",
      "There was only silence.",
      "Harry put his hand into the pouch and said \"Box of cereal\nbars.\"",
      "A box that felt like the right shape popped up into his hand...\nbut it was too light, and it was open, and it was empty, and the\nnote attached to it said:",
      "POINTS SPENT: 1\nCURRENT POINTS: 98\nYOU HAVE GAINED: A BOX OF CEREAL BARS",
      "\"I'd like to spend one point and get the actual cereal\nbars back,\" said Harry.",
      "Again, silence.",
      "Harry put his hand into the pouch and said \"cereal bars\".",
      "Nothing came up.",
      "Harry shrugged despairingly and went over to the cabinet he'd\nbeen given near his bed, to get his wizard's robes for the day.",
      "On the floor of the cabinet, under his robes, were the cereal\nbars, and a note:",
      "POINTS SPENT: 1\nCURRENT POINTS: 97\nYOU HAVE GAINED: 6 CEREAL BARS\nYOU ARE STILL WEARING: PYJAMAS\nDO NOT EAT WHILE YOU ARE WEARING YOUR PYJAMAS\nYOU WILL GET A PYJAMA PENALTY",
      "And now I know that whoever controls the game is\ninsane.",
      "\"My guess is that the game is controlled by Dumbledore,\" Harry\nsaid out loud. Maybe this time he could set a new land\nspeed record for being quick on the uptake.",
      "Silence.",
      "But Harry was starting to pick up the pattern; the note would be\nin the next place he looked. So Harry looked under his bed.",
      "HA! HA HA HA HA HA!\nHA HA HA HA HA HA!\nHA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!\nDUMBLEDORE DOES NOT CONTROL THE GAME\nBAD GUESS\nVERY BAD GUESS\n-20 POINTS\nAND YOU ARE STILL WEARING PYJAMAS\nIT IS YOUR FOURTH MOVE\nAND YOU ARE STILL WEARING PYJAMAS\nPYJAMA PENALTY: -2 POINTS\nCURRENT POINTS: 75",
      "Welp, that was a puzzler, all right. It was only his first day\nat school and once you ruled out Dumbledore, he didn't know the\nname of anyone else here who was this crazy.",
      "His body more or less on autopilot, Harry gathered up a set of\nrobes and underwear, pulled out the cavern level of his trunk (he\nwas a very private sort of person and someone might walk into the\ndorm), got dressed, and then went back upstairs to put away his\npyjamas.",
      "Harry paused before pulling out the cabinet drawer that held his\npyjamas. If the pattern here held true...",
      "\"How can I earn more points?\" Harry said out loud.",
      "Then he pulled out the drawer.",
      "OPPORTUNITIES TO DO GOOD ARE EVERYWHERE\nBUT DARKNESS IS WHERE THE LIGHT NEEDS TO BE\nCOST OF QUESTION: 1 POINT\nCURRENT POINTS: 74\nNICE UNDERWEAR\nDID YOUR MOTHER PICK THEM OUT?",
      "Harry crushed the note in his hand, face flaming scarlet.\nDraco's curse came back to him. Son of a mudblood -",
      "At this point he knew better than to say it out loud. He would\nprobably get a Profanity Penalty.",
      "Harry girded himself with his mokeskin pouch and wand. He peeled\noff the wrapper of one his cereal bars and threw it into the room's\nrubbish bin, where it landed atop a mostly-uneaten Chocolate Frog,\na crumpled envelope and some green and red wrapping paper. He put\nthe other cereal bars into his mokeskin pouch.",
      "He looked around in a final, desperate, and ultimately futile\nsearch for clues.",
      "And then Harry left the dorm, eating as he went, in search of\nthe Slytherin dungeons. At least that was what he thought\nthe line was about.",
      "Trying to navigate the halls of Hogwarts was like... probably\nnot quite as bad as wandering around inside an Escher\npainting, that was the sort of thing you said for rhetorical effect\nrather than for its being true.",
      "A short time later, Harry was thinking that in fact an Escher\npainting would have both pluses and minuses compared to Hogwarts.\nMinuses: No consistent gravitational orientation. Pluses: At least\nthe stairs wouldn't move around WHILE YOU WERE STILL ON\nTHEM.",
      "Harry had originally climbed four flights of stairs to get to\nhis dorm. After clambering down no fewer than twelve flights of\nstairs without getting anywhere near the dungeons, Harry had\nconcluded that (1) an Escher painting would be a cakewalk\nby comparison, (2) he was somehow higher in the castle\nthan when he'd started, and (3) he was so thoroughly lost\nthat he wouldn't have been surprised to look out of the next window\nand see two moons in the sky.",
      "Backup plan A had been to stop and ask for directions, but there\nseemed to be an extreme lack of people wandering around, as if the\nbeggars were all attending class the way they were supposed to or\nsomething.",
      "Backup plan B...",
      "\"I'm lost,\" Harry said out loud. \"Can, um, the spirit of the\nHogwarts castle help me or something?\"",
      "\"I don't think this castle has a spirit,\" observed a wizened old\nlady in one of the paintings on the walls. \"Life, perhaps, but not\nspirit.\"",
      "There was a brief pause.",
      "\"Are you -\" Harry said, and then shut his mouth. On second\nthought, no he was NOT going to ask the painting whether it was\nfully conscious in the sense of being aware of its own\nawareness.",
      "\"I'm Harry Potter,\" said his mouth, more or less on autopilot.\nAlso more or less automatically, Harry stuck out a hand towards the\npainting.",
      "The woman in the painting looked down at Harry's hand and raised\nher eyebrows.",
      "Slowly, the hand dropped back to Harry's side.",
      "\"Sorry,\" Harry said, \"I'm sort of new here.\"",
      "\"So I perceive, young raven. Where are you trying to go?\"",
      "Harry hesitated. \"I'm not really sure,\" he said.",
      "\"Then perhaps you are already there.\"",
      "\"Well, wherever I am trying to go, I don't think\nthis is it...\" Harry shut his mouth, aware of just how\nmuch he was sounding like an idiot. \"Let me start over. I'm playing\nthis game only I don't know what the rules are -\" That didn't\nreally work either, did it. \"Okay, third try. I'm looking for\nopportunities to do good so I can score points, and all I have is\nthis cryptic hint about how darkness is where the light needs to\nbe, so I was trying to go down but I seem to keep going up\ninstead...\"",
      "The old lady in the painting was looking at him rather\nsceptically.",
      "Harry sighed. \"My life tends to get a bit peculiar.\"",
      "\"Would it be fair to say that you don't know where you're going\nor why you're trying to get there?\"",
      "\"Entirely fair.\"",
      "The old lady nodded. \"I'm not sure that being lost is your most\nimportant problem, young man.\"",
      "\"True, but unlike the more important problems, it's a problem I\ncan understand how to solve and wow is this conversation\nturning into a metaphor for human existence, I didn't even realise\nthat was happening until just now.\"",
      "The lady eyed Harry appraisingly. \"You are a fine young\nraven, aren't you? For a moment I was starting to wonder. Well\nthen, as a general rule, if you keep on turning left, you're bound\nto keep going down.\"",
      "That sounded strangely familiar but Harry couldn't recall where\nhe'd heard it before. \"Um... you seem like a very intelligent\nperson. Or a picture of a very intelligent person... anyway, have\nyou heard of a mysterious game where you can only play once, and\nthey won't tell you the rules?\"",
      "\"Life,\" said the lady at once. \"That's one of the most obvious\nriddles I've ever heard.\"",
      "Harry blinked. \"No,\" he said slowly. \"I mean I got an actual\nnote and everything saying that I had to play the game but I\nwouldn't be told the rules, and someone is leaving me little slips\nof paper telling me how many points I've lost for violating the\nrules, like a minus two point penalty for wearing pyjamas. Do you\nknow anyone here at Hogwarts who's crazy enough and powerful enough\nto do something like that? Besides Dumbledore, I mean?\"",
      "The picture of a lady sighed. \"I'm only a picture, young man. I\nremember Hogwarts as it was - not Hogwarts as it is. All I can tell\nyou is that if this were a riddle, the answer would be that the\ngame is life, and that while we do not make all the rules\nourselves, the one who awards or takes points is always you. If it\nis not riddle but reality - then I do not know.\"",
      "Harry bowed very low to the picture. \"Thank you, milady.\"",
      "The lady curtseyed to him. \"I wish I could say that I'll\nremember you with fondness,\" she said, \"but I probably won't\nremember you at all. Farewell, Harry Potter.\"",
      "He bowed again in reply, and started to climb down the nearest\nflight of stairs.",
      "Four left turns later he found himself staring down a corridor\nthat ended, abruptly, in a tumbled mound of large rocks - as if\nthere had been a cave-in, only the surrounding walls and ceiling\nwere intact and made of quite regular castle stones.",
      "\"All right,\" Harry said to the empty air, \"I give up. I'm asking\nfor another hint. How do I get to where I need to go?\"",
      "\"A hint! A hint, you say?\"",
      "The excited voice came from a painting on the wall not far away,\nthis one a portrait of a middle-aged man in the loudest pink robes\nthat Harry had ever seen or even imagined. In the portrait he was\nwearing a droopy old pointed hat with a fish on it (not a drawing\nof a fish, mind, but a fish).",
      "\"Yes!\" Harry said. \"A hint! A hint, I say! Only not just\nany hint, I'm looking for a specific hint, it's\nfor a game I'm playing -\"",
      "\"Yes, yes! A hint for the game! You're Harry Potter, aren't you?\nI'm Cornelion Flubberwalt! I was told by Erin the Consort who was\ntold by Lord Weaselnose who was told by, I forget really. But it\nwas a message for me to give to you! For me! No\none's cared about me in, I don't know how long, maybe ever, I've\nbeen stuck down here in this bloody useless old corridor - a hint!\nI have your hint! It will only cost you three points! Do you want\nit?\"",
      "\"Yes! I want it!\" Harry was aware that he probably ought to keep\nhis sarcasm under control but he just couldn't seem to help\nhimself.",
      "\"The darkness can be found between the green study rooms and\nMcGonagall's Transfiguration class! That's the hint! And get a move\non, you're slower than a sack of snails! Minus ten points for being\nslow! Now you have 61 points! That was the rest of the\nmessage!\"",
      "\"Thank you,\" Harry said. He was really getting behind on the\ngame here. \"Um... I don't suppose you know where the message\noriginally came from, do you?\"",
      "\"It was spoken by a hollow voice that belled forth from a gap\nwithin the air itself, a gap that opened upon a fiery abyss! That's\nwhat they told me!\"",
      "Harry was no longer sure, at this point, whether this was the\nsort of thing he ought to be sceptical about, or the sort of thing\nhe should just take in stride. \"And how can I find the line between\nthe green study rooms and Transfiguration class?\"",
      "\"Just spin back around and go left, right, down, down, right,\nleft, right, up, and left again, you'll be at the green study room\nand if you go in and walk straight out the opposite side you'll be\non a big curvy corridor that goes to an intersection and on the\nright side of that intersection will be a long straight hallway\nthat goes to the Transfiguration classroom!\" The figure of the\nmiddle-aged man paused. \"At least that's how it was when I\nwas in Hogwarts. This is a Monday on an odd-numbered year,\nisn't it?\"",
      "\"Pencil and mechanical paper,\" Harry said to his pouch. \"Er,\ncancel that, paper and mechanical pencil.\" He looked up. \"Could you\nrepeat that?\"",
      "After getting lost another two times, Harry felt that he was\nbeginning to understand the basic rule for navigating the\never-changing maze that was Hogwarts, namely, ask a painting\nfor directions. If this reflected some sort of incredibly deep\nlife lesson he couldn't figure out what it was.",
      "The green study room was a surprisingly pleasant space with\nsunlight streaming in from windows of green-stained glass that\nshowed dragons in calm, pastoral scenes. It had chairs that looked\nextremely comfortable, and tables that seemed very well-suited to\nstudying in the company of one to three friends.",
      "Harry couldn't actually walk straight through and out\nthe door on the other side. There were bookshelves set\ninto the wall, and he had to go over and read some of the titles,\nso as to not lose his claim to the Verres family name. But he did\nit quickly, mindful of the complaint about being slow, and then\nwent out the other side.",
      "He was walking down the \"big curvy corridor\" when he heard a\nyoung boy's voice cry out.",
      "At times like this, Harry had an excuse to sprint all-out with\nno regards for saving energy or doing proper warmup exercises or\nworrying about crashing into things, a sudden frantic flight that\nnearly came to an equally sudden halt as he almost ran over a group\nof six first-year Hufflepuffs...",
      "...who were huddled together, looking rather scared and like\nthey desperately wanted to do something but couldn't figure out\nwhat, which probably had something to do with the group of five\nolder Slytherins who seemed to be surrounding another young\nboy.",
      "Harry was suddenly rather angry.",
      "\"Excuse me!\u202f\" shouted Harry at the top of his\nlungs.",
      "It might not have been necessary. People were already looking at\nhim. But it certainly served to stop all the action cold.",
      "Harry walked past the cluster of Hufflepuffs towards the\nSlytherins.",
      "They looked down at him with expressions that ranged from anger\nto amusement to delight.",
      "Part of Harry's brain was screaming in panic that these were\nmuch older and bigger boys who could stomp him flat.",
      "Another part said dryly that anyone caught seriously stomping\nthe Boy-Who-Lived was in for a whole world of trouble,\nespecially if they were a pack of older Slytherins and there were\nseven Hufflepuffs who saw it, and that the chance of them doing him\nany permanent damage in the presence of witnesses was nearly zero.\nThe only real weapon the older boys had against him was his own\nfear, if he allowed that.",
      "Then Harry saw that the boy they had trapped was Neville\nLongbottom.",
      "Of course.",
      "That settled it. Harry had decided to apologise humbly to\nNeville and that meant Neville was his, how dare\nthey?",
      "Harry reached out and grabbed Neville by the wrist and\nyanked him out from between the Slytherins, the boy\nstumbling in shock as Harry pulled him out and in nearly the same\nmotion pushed his own way through the same gap.",
      "And Harry stood in the center of the Slytherins where Neville\nhad stood, looking up at the much older, larger, and stronger\nboys.",
      "\"Hello,\" Harry said. \"I'm the Boy-Who-Lived.\"",
      "There was a rather awkward pause. No one seemed to know where\nthe conversation was supposed to go from there.",
      "Harry's eyes dropped downwards and saw some books and papers\nscattered around the floor. Oh, the old game where you let the boy\ntry to pick up his books and then knock them out of his hand again.\nHarry couldn't remember ever being the object of that game himself,\nbut he had a good imagination and his imagination was making him\nfurious. Well, once the larger situation was resolved it would be\neasy enough for Neville to come back and pick up his materials,\nprovided that the Slytherins stayed too intent on him to think of\ndoing anything to the books.",
      "Unfortunately his straying eyes had been noted. \"Ooh,\" said the\nlargest of the boys, \"did 'oo want the widdle books -\"",
      "\"Shut up,\" Harry said coldly. Keep them off balance. Don't\ndo what they expect. Don't fall into a pattern that calls for them\nto bully you. \"Is this part of some incredibly clever plan\nthat will gain you future advantage, or is it as pointless a\ndisgrace to the name of Salazar Slytherin as it -\"",
      "The largest boy shoved Harry Potter hard, and he went sprawling\nout of the circle of Slytherins onto the hard stone floor of\nHogwarts.",
      "And the Slytherins laughed.",
      "Harry rose up in what seemed to him like terribly slow motion.\nHe didn't know yet how to use his wand, but there was no reason to\nlet that stop him, under the circumstances.",
      "\"I'd like to pay as many points as it takes to get rid\nof this person,\" Harry said, pointing with his finger to the\nlargest Slytherin.",
      "Then Harry lifted his other hand, said \"Abracadabra,\" and\nsnapped his fingers.",
      "At the word Abracadabra two of the Hufflepuffs\nscreamed, including Neville, three other Slytherins leapt\ndesperately out of the way of Harry's finger, and the largest\nSlytherin staggered back with an expression of shock, a sudden\nsplash of red decorating his face and neck and chest.",
      "Harry had not been expecting that.",
      "Slowly, the largest Slytherin reached up to his head, and peeled\noff the pan of cherry pie that had just draped itself over him. The\nlargest Slytherin held the pan in his hand for a moment, staring at\nit, then dropped it to the floor.",
      "It probably wasn't the best time in the world for one of the\nHufflepuffs to start laughing, but that was exactly what one of the\nHufflepuffs was doing.",
      "Then Harry caught sight of the note on the bottom of the\npan.",
      "\"Hold on,\" Harry said, and darted forward to pick up the note.\n\"This note's for me, I think -\"",
      "\"You,\" growled the largest Slytherin, \"you, are,\ngoing, to -\"",
      "\"Look at this!\" shouted Harry, brandishing the note at\nthe older Slytherin. \"I mean, just look at this! Can you\nbelieve I'm being charged 30 points for shipping and handling on\none lousy pie? 30 points! I'm turning a loss on the deal even after\nrescuing an innocent boy in distress! And storage fees? Conveyance\ncharges? Drayage costs? How do you get drayage costs on a\npie?\u202f\"",
      "There was another one of those awkward pauses. Harry thought\ndeadly thoughts at whichever Hufflepuff couldn't seem to stop\ngiggling, that idiot was going to get him hurt.",
      "Harry stepped back and shot the Slytherins his best lethal\nglare. \"Now go away or I will just keep making your existence more\nand more surreal until you do. Let me warn you... messing with\nmy life tends to make your life... a little\nhairy. Get it?\"",
      "In a single terrible motion, the largest Slytherin whipped his\nwand out to point at Harry and in the same instant was hit on the\nother side of his head by another pie, this one bright\nblueberry.",
      "The note on this pie was rather large and clearly readable. \"You\nmight want to read the note on that pie,\" Harry observed. \"I think\nit's for you this time.\"",
      "The Slytherin slowly reached up, took the pie pan, turned it\nover with a wet glop that dropped more blueberry on the floor, and\nread a note that said:",
      "WARNING\nNO MAGIC MAY BE\nUSED ON THE CONTESTANT\nWHILE THE GAME IS IN PROGRESS\nFURTHER INTERFERENCE IN THE GAME\nWILL BE REPORTED TO\nTHE GAME AUTHORITIES",
      "The expression of sheer bafflement on the Slytherin's face was a\nlook of art. Harry thought that he might be starting to like this\nGame Controller.",
      "\"Look,\" Harry said, \"you want to call it a day? I think things\nare spiralling out of control here. How about you go back to\nSlytherin and I go back to Ravenclaw and we all just cool down a\nbit, okay?\"",
      "\"I've got a better idea,\" hissed the largest Slytherin. \"How\nabout if you accidentally break all your fingers?\"",
      "\"How in Merlin's name do you stage a believable accident after\nmaking the threat in front of a dozen witnesses, you idiot\n-\"",
      "The largest Slytherin slowly, deliberately reached out towards\nHarry's hands, and Harry froze in place, the part of his brain that\nwas noticing the other boy's age and strength finally managing to\nmake itself heard, screaming, WHAT THE HECK AM I\nDOING?",
      "\"Wait!\" said one of the other Slytherins, his voice suddenly\npanicky. \"Stop, you shouldn't actually do that!\"",
      "The largest Slytherin ignored him, taking Harry's right hand\nfirmly in his left hand, and taking Harry's index finger in his\nright hand.",
      "Harry stared the Slytherin straight in the eyes. Part of Harry\nwas screaming, this wasn't supposed to happen, this wasn't\nallowed to happen, grownups would never let something like\nthis actually happen -",
      "Slowly, the Slytherin started to bend his index finger\nbackwards.",
      "He hasn't actually broken my finger and it is beneath me to\nso much as flinch until he does. Until then, this is just another\nattempt to cause fear.",
      "\"Stop!\" said the Slytherin who had objected before. \"Stop, this\nis a very bad idea!\"",
      "\"I rather agree,\" said an icy voice. An older woman's voice.",
      "The largest Slytherin let go of Harry's hand and jumped\nbackwards as if burned.",
      "\"Professor Sprout!\" cried one of the Hufflepuffs, sounding as\nglad as anyone Harry had ever heard in his life.",
      "Into Harry's field of vision, as he turned, stalked a dumpy\nlittle woman with messily curled grey hair and clothes covered with\ndirt. She pointed an accusing finger at the Slytherins. \"Explain\nyourselves,\" she said. \"What are you doing with my Hufflepuffs\nand...\" she looked at him. \"My fine student, Harry Potter.\"",
      "Uh oh. That's right, it was HER class I missed this\nmorning.",
      "\"He threatened to kill us!\" blurted one of the other Slytherins,\nthe same one who'd called for a halt.",
      "\"What?\" Harry said blankly. \"I did not! If I was going\nto kill you I wouldn't make public threats first!\"",
      "A third Slytherin laughed helplessly and then stopped abruptly\nas the other boys shot him deadly glares.",
      "Professor Sprout had adopted a rather sceptical expression.\n\"What death threat would this be, exactly?\"",
      "\"The Killing Curse! He pretended to use the Killing Curse on\nus!\"",
      "Professor Sprout turned to look at Harry. \"Yes, quite a terrible\nthreat from an eleven-year-old boy. Though still not something you\nshould ever dream of pretending, Harry Potter.\"",
      "\"I don't even know the words to the Killing Curse,\"\nHarry said promptly. \"And I didn't have my wand out at any\ntime.\"",
      "Now Professor Sprout was giving Harry a sceptical look. \"I\nsuppose this boy hit himself with two pies, then.\"",
      "\"He didn't use his wand!\" blurted one of the young\nHufflepuffs. \"I don't know how he did it either, he just snapped\nhis fingers and there was pie!\"",
      "\"Really,\" said Professor Sprout after a pause. She drew her own\nwand. \"I won't require it, since you do seem to be the victim here,\nbut would you mind if I checked your wand to verify that?\"",
      "Harry took out his wand. \"What do I -\"",
      "\"Prior Incantato,\" said Sprout. She frowned. \"That's\nodd, your wand doesn't seem to have been used at all.\"",
      "Harry shrugged. \"It hasn't, actually, I only got my wand and\nschoolbooks a few days ago.\"",
      "Sprout nodded. \"Then we have a clear case of accidental magic\nfrom a boy who felt threatened. And the rules plainly state that\nyou are not to be held responsible. As for you...\" she\nturned to the Slytherins. Her eyes dropped deliberately to\nNeville's books lying on the floor.",
      "There was a long silence during which she looked at the five\nSlytherins.",
      "\"Three points from Slytherin, each,\" she said finally.\n\"And six from him,\" pointing to the boy covered in pie.\n\"Don't you ever meddle with my Hufflepuffs again, or my\nstudent Harry Potter either. Now go.\"",
      "She didn't have to repeat herself; the Slytherins turned and\nwalked away very quickly.",
      "Neville went and started picking up his books. He seemed to be\ncrying, but only a little. It might have been from delayed shock,\nor it might have been because the other boys were helping him.",
      "\"Thank you very much, Harry Potter,\" Professor Sprout\nsaid to him. \"Seven points to Ravenclaw, one for each Hufflepuff\nyou helped protect. And I won't say anything more.\"",
      "Harry blinked. He'd been expecting something more along the\nlines of a lecture about keeping himself out of trouble, and a\nrather severe scolding for missing his very first class.",
      "Maybe he should have gone to Hufflepuff. Sprout was\ncool.",
      "\"Scourgify,\" Sprout said to the mess of pie on the\nfloor, which promptly vanished.",
      "And she left, walking along the hall that led to the green study\nroom.",
      "\"How did you do that?\" hissed one of the Hufflepuff\nboys as soon as she was gone.",
      "Harry smiled smugly. \"I can make anything I want happen just by\nsnapping my fingers.\"",
      "The boy's eyes widened. \"Really?\u202f\"",
      "\"No,\" said Harry. \"But when you're telling everyone this story\nbe sure to share it with Hermione Granger in first-year Ravenclaw,\nshe has an anecdote you might find amusing.\" He had absolutely no\nclue what was happening, but he wasn't about to pass up the\nopportunity to add to his growing legend. \"Oh, and what was all\nthat about the Killing Curse?\"",
      "The boy gave him a strange look. \"You really don't know?\"",
      "\"If I did, I wouldn't be asking.\"",
      "\"The words to the Killing Curse are,\" the boy swallowed, and his\nvoice dropped to a whisper, and he held his hands away from his\nsides as if to make it very clear that he wasn't holding a wand,\n\"Avada Kedavra.\"",
      "Well of course they are.",
      "Harry put this on his growing list of things to never ever tell\nhis Dad, Professor Michael Verres-Evans. It was bad enough talking\nabout how you were the only person to survive the fearsome Killing\nCurse, without having to admit that the Killing Curse was\n\"Abracadabra.\"",
      "\"I see,\" Harry said after a pause. \"Well, that's the last time I\never say that before snapping my fingers.\" Though it\nhad produced an effect that might be tactically\nuseful.",
      "\"Why did you -\"",
      "\"Raised by Muggles, Muggles think it's a joke and that it's\nfunny. Seriously, that's what happened. Sorry, but can you remind\nme of your name?\"",
      "\"I'm Ernie Macmillan,\" said the Hufflepuff. He held out his\nhand, and Harry shook it. \"Honoured to meet you.\"",
      "Harry executed a slight bow. \"Pleased to meet you, skip the\nhonoured thing.\"",
      "Then the other boys crowded round him and there was a sudden\nflood of introductions.",
      "When they were done, Harry swallowed. This was going to be very\ndifficult. \"Um... if everyone would excuse me... I have something\nto say to Neville -\"",
      "All eyes turned to Neville, who took a step back, his face\nlooking apprehensive.",
      "\"I suppose,\" Neville said in a tiny voice, \"you're going to say\nI should've been braver -\"",
      "\"Oh, no, nothing like that!\" Harry said hastily. \"Nothing to do\nwith that. It's just, um, something the Sorting Hat told\nme -\"",
      "Suddenly the other boys looked very interested, except\nfor Neville, who was looking even more apprehensive.",
      "There seemed to be something blocking Harry's throat. He knew he\nshould just blurt it out, and it was like he'd swallowed a large\nbrick that was just stuck in the way.",
      "It was like Harry had to manually take control of his lips and\nproduce each syllable individually, but he managed to make it\nhappen. \"I'm, sor, ry.\" He exhaled and took a deep breath. \"For\nwhat I did, um, the other day. You... don't have to be gracious\nabout it or anything, I'll understand if you just hate me. This\nisn't about me trying to look cool by apologising or your having to\naccept it. What I did was wrong.\"",
      "There was a pause.",
      "Neville clutched his books tighter to his chest. \"Why did you do\nit?\" he said in a thin, wavering voice. He blinked, as if trying to\nhold back tears. \"Why does everyone do that to me, even\nthe Boy-Who-Lived?\"",
      "Harry suddenly felt smaller than he ever had in his life. \"I'm\nsorry,\" Harry said again, his voice now hoarsened. \"It's just...\nyou looked so scared, it was like a sign over your head saying\n'victim', and I wanted to show you that things don't\nalways turn out badly, that sometimes the monsters give you\nchocolate... I thought if I showed you that, you might realise\nthere wasn't so much to be afraid of -\"",
      "\"But there is,\" whispered Neville. \"You saw it today,\nthere is!\u202f\"",
      "\"They wouldn't have done anything really bad in front of\nwitnesses. Their main weapon is fear. That's why they target\nyou, because they can see you're afraid. I wanted to make\nyou less afraid... show you that the fear was worse than the thing\nitself... or that was what I told myself, but the Sorting Hat told\nme that I was lying to myself and that I really did it because it\nwas fun. So that's why I'm apologising -\"",
      "\"You hurt me,\" said Neville. \"Just now. When you grabbed me and\npulled me away from them.\" Neville held out his arm and pointed to\nwhere Harry had grabbed him. \"I might have a bruise here later from\nhow hard you pulled. You hurt me worse than anything the Slytherins\ndid by bumping into me, actually.\"",
      "\"Neville!\u202f\" hissed Ernie. \"He was trying to\nsave you!\"",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" whispered Harry. \"When I saw that I just got...\nreally angry...\"",
      "Neville looked at him steadily. \"So you yanked me out really\nhard and put yourself in where I was and went, 'Hello, I'm the\nBoy-Who-Lived'.\"",
      "Harry nodded.",
      "\"I think you're going to be really cool someday,\" Neville said.\n\"But right now, you're not.\"",
      "Harry swallowed the sudden knot in his throat and walked away.\nHe continued down the corridor to the intersection, then turned\nleft into a hallway and kept on walking, blindly.",
      "What was he supposed to do here? Never get angry? He\nwasn't sure he could have done anything without being angry and who\nknows what would have happened to Neville and his books then.\nBesides, Harry had read enough fantasy books to know how\nthis one went. He would try to suppress the anger and he\nwould fail and it would keep coming out again. And after this whole\nlong journey of self-discovery he would learn at the end that his\nanger was a part of himself and that only by accepting it could he\nlearn to use it wisely. Star Wars was the only universe in\nwhich the answer actually was that you were supposed to\ncut yourself off completely from negative emotions, and something\nabout Yoda had always made Harry hate the little green moron.",
      "So the obvious time-saving plan was to skip the journey of\nself-discovery and go straight to the part where he realised that\nonly by accepting his anger as a part of himself could he stay in\ncontrol of it.",
      "The problem was that he didn't feel out of control when\nhe was angry. The cold rage made him feel like he was in\ncontrol. It was only when he looked back that events as a\nwhole seemed to have... blown up out of control, somehow.",
      "He wondered how much the Game Controller cared about that sort\nof thing, and whether he'd won or lost points for it. Harry himself\nfelt like he'd lost quite a few points, and he was sure the old\nlady in the picture would have told him that his was the only\nopinion that mattered.",
      "And Harry was also wondering whether the Game Controller had\nsent Professor Sprout. It was the logical thought: the note had\nthreatened to notify the Game Authorities, and then there Professor\nSprout was. Maybe Professor Sprout was the Game Controller\n- the Head of House Hufflepuff would be the last\nperson anyone would suspect, which ought to put her near the top of\nHarry's list. He'd read one or two mystery novels, too.",
      "\"So how am I doing in the game?\" Harry said out loud.",
      "A sheet of paper flew over his head, as if someone had thrown it\nfrom behind him - Harry turned around, but there was no one there -\nand when Harry turned forwards again, the note was settling to the\nfloor.",
      "The note said:",
      "POINTS FOR STYLE: 10\nPOINTS FOR GOOD THINKING: -3,000,000\nRAVENCLAW HOUSE POINTS BONUS: 70\nCURRENT POINTS: -2,999,871\nTURNS REMAINING: 2",
      "\"Minus three million points?\" Harry said indignantly to\nthe empty hallway. \"That seems excessive! I want to file an appeal\nwith the Game Authorities! And how am I supposed to make up three\nmillion points in the next two turns?\"",
      "Another note flew over his head.",
      "APPEAL: FAILED\nASKING THE WRONG QUESTIONS: -1,000,000,000,000 POINTS\nCURRENT POINTS: -1,000,002,999,871\nTURNS REMAINING: 1",
      "Harry gave up. With one turn remaining all he could do was take\nhis best shot, even if it wasn't very good. \"My guess is that the\ngame represents life.\"",
      "A final sheet of paper flew over his head, reading:",
      "ATTEMPT FAILED\nFAILED FAILED FAILED\nAIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\nCURRENT POINTS: MINUS INFINITY\nYOU HAVE LOST THE\nGAME",
      "FINAL INSTRUCTION:\ngo to Professor McGonagall's office",
      "The last line was in his own handwriting.",
      "Harry stared at the last line for a while, then shrugged. Fine.\nProfessor McGonagall's office it would be. If she was the\nGame Controller...",
      "Okay, honestly, Harry had absolutely no idea how he would feel\nif Professor McGonagall was the Game Controller. His mind was just\ndrawing a complete blank. It was, literally, unimaginable.",
      "A couple of portraits later - it wasn't a long trip, Professor\nMcGonagall's office wasn't far from her Transfiguration classroom,\nat least not on Mondays on odd-numbered years - Harry stood outside\nthe door to her office.",
      "He knocked.",
      "\"Come in,\" said Professor McGonagall's muffled voice.",
      "He entered."

      "Harry did so.",
      "The office of the Deputy Headmistress was clean and\nwell-organised; on the wall immediately adjacent to the desk was a\nmaze of wooden cubbyholes of all shapes and sizes, most with\nseveral parchment scrolls thrust into them, and it was somehow very\nclear that Professor McGonagall knew exactly what every cubbyhole\nmeant, even if no one else did. A single parchment lay on the\nactual desk, which was, aside from that, clean. Behind the desk was\na closed door barred with several locks.",
      "Professor McGonagall was sitting on a backless stool behind the\ndesk, looking puzzled - her eyes had widened, with perhaps a slight\nnote of apprehension, as she saw Harry.",
      "\"Mr. Potter?\" said Professor McGonagall. \"What is this\nabout?\"",
      "Harry's mind went blank. He'd been instructed by the game to\ncome here, he had been expecting her to have something in\nmind...",
      "\"Mr. Potter?\" said Professor McGonagall, starting to look\nslightly annoyed.",
      "Thankfully, Harry's panicking brain remembered at this point\nthat he did have something he'd been planning to discuss\nwith Professor McGonagall. Something important and well worth her\ntime.",
      "\"Um...\" Harry said. \"If there are any spells you can cast to\nmake sure no one's listening to us...\"",
      "Professor McGonagall stood up from her chair, firmly closed the\nouter door, and began taking out her wand and saying spells.",
      "It was at this point that Harry realised he was faced with a\npriceless and possibly irreplaceable opportunity to offer Professor\nMcGonagall a Comed-Tea and he couldn't believe he was seriously\nthinking that and it would be fine the soda would vanish after a\nfew seconds and he told that part of himself to shut\nup.",
      "It did, and Harry began to organise mentally what he was going\nto say. He hadn't planned to have this discussion quite so\nsoon, but so long as he was here...",
      "Professor McGonagall finished a spell that sounded a lot older\nthan Latin, and then she sat down again.",
      "\"All right,\" she said in a quiet voice. \"No one's listening.\"\nHer face was rather tight.",
      "Oh, right, she's expecting me to blackmail her for\ninformation about the prophecy.",
      "Eh, Harry'd get around to that some other day.",
      "\"It's about the Incident with the Sorting Hat,\" Harry said.\n(Professor McGonagall blinked.) \"Um... I think there's an extra\nspell on the Sorting Hat, something that the Sorting Hat itself\ndoesn't know about, something that triggers when the Sorting Hat\nsays Slytherin. I heard a message that I'm pretty sure Ravenclaws\naren't supposed to hear. It came the moment the Sorting Hat was off\nmy head and I felt the connection break. It sounded like a hiss and\nlike English at the same time,\" there was a sharp intake of breath\nfrom McGonagall, \"and it said: Salutations from Slytherin to\nSlytherin, if you would seek my secrets, speak to my snake.\"",
      "Professor McGonagall sat there with her mouth open, staring at\nHarry as if he'd grown another two heads.",
      "\"So...\" Professor McGonagall said slowly, as though she couldn't\nbelieve the words that were coming out of her own lips, \"you\ndecided to come to me right away and tell me about it.\"",
      "\"Well, yes, of course,\" Harry said. There was no need to admit\nhow long it had taken him to actually think of that. \"As opposed\nto, say, trying to research it myself, or telling any of the other\nchildren.\"",
      "\"I... see,\" Professor McGonagall said. \"And if, perhaps, you\nwere to discover the entrance to Salazar Slytherin's legendary\nChamber of Secrets, an entrance that you and you alone could\nopen...\"",
      "\"I would close the entrance and report to you at once so that a\nteam of experienced magical archaeologists could be assembled,\"\nHarry said promptly. \"Then I would open up the entrance again and\nthey would go in very carefully to make sure that there was nothing\ndangerous. I might go in later to look around, or if they needed me\nto open up something else, but it would be after the area had been\ndeclared clear and they had photographs of how everything looked\nbefore people started tromping around their priceless historical\nsite.\"",
      "Professor McGonagall sat there with her mouth open, staring at\nhim like he'd just turned into a cat.",
      "\"It's obvious if you're not a Gryffindor,\" Harry said\nkindly.",
      "\"I think,\" Professor McGonagall said in a rather choked voice,\n\"that you far underestimate the rarity of common sense,\nMr. Potter.\"",
      "That sounded about right. Although... \"A Hufflepuff would've\nsaid the same thing.\"",
      "McGonagall paused, struck. \"That's true.\"",
      "\"Sorting Hat offered me Hufflepuff.\"",
      "She blinked at him as though she couldn't believe her own ears.\n\"Did it really?\u202f\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"Mr. Potter,\" McGonagall said, and now her voice was low, \"five\ndecades ago was the last time a student died within the walls of\nHogwarts, and I am now certain that five decades ago was the last\ntime someone heard that message.\"",
      "A chill went through Harry. \"Then I will be very sure\nto take no action whatsoever on this matter without\nconsulting you, Professor McGonagall.\" He paused. \"And may I\nsuggest that you get together the best people you can find and see\nif it's possible to get that extra spell off the Sorting Hat... and\nif you can't do that, maybe put on another spell, a\nQuietus that briefly activates just as the Hat is being removed\nfrom a student's head, that might work as a patch. There, no more\ndead students.\" Harry nodded in satisfaction.",
      "Professor McGonagall looked even more stunned, if such a thing\nwere imaginable. \"I cannot possibly award you enough\npoints for this without giving the House Cup to Ravenclaw\noutright.\"",
      "\"Um,\" Harry said. \"Um. I'd rather not earn that many\nHouse points.\"",
      "Now Professor McGonagall was giving him a strange look. \"Why\nnot?\"",
      "Harry was having a little difficulty putting it into words.\n\"Because it would be just too sad, you know? Like... like back when\nI was still trying to go to school in the Muggle world, and\nwhenever there was a group project, I'd go ahead and do the whole\nthing myself because the others would only slow me down. I'm fine\nwith earning lots of points, more than anyone else even, but if I\nearn enough to be decisive in winning the House Cup just by myself,\nthen it's like I'm carrying House Ravenclaw on my back and that's\ntoo sad.\"",
      "\"I see...\" McGonagall said hesitantly. It was apparent that this\nway of thinking had never occurred to her. \"Suppose I only awarded\nyou fifty points, then?\"",
      "Harry shook his head again. \"It's not fair to the other children\nif I earn lots of points for grownup things that I can be part of\nand they can't. How is Terry Boot supposed to earn fifty points for\nreporting a whisper he heard from the Sorting Hat? It wouldn't be\nfair at all.\"",
      "\"I see why the Sorting Hat offered you Hufflepuff,\" said\nProfessor McGonagall. She was eyeing him with a strange\nrespect.",
      "That made Harry choke up a bit. He'd honestly thought he wasn't\nworthy of Hufflepuff. That the Sorting Hat had just been trying to\nshove him anywhere but Ravenclaw, into a House whose virtues he\ndidn't have...",
      "Professor McGonagall was smiling now. \"And if I tried to give\nyou ten points...?\"",
      "\"Are you going to explain where those ten points came from, if\nanyone asks? There might be a lot of Slytherins, and I don't mean\nthe children at Hogwarts, who would be really really angry\nif they knew about the spell being taken off the Sorting Hat and\nfound out I was involved. So I think that absolute secrecy is the\nbetter part of valour. No need to thank me, ma'am, virtue is its\nown reward.\"",
      "\"So it is,\" Professor McGonagall said, \"but I do have a very\nspecial something else to give you. I see that I have greatly\nwronged you in my thoughts, Mr. Potter. Please wait here.\"",
      "She got up, went over to the locked back door, waved her wand,\nand a sort of blurry curtain sprang up around her. Harry could\nneither see nor hear what was going on. It was a few minutes later\nthat the blur vanished and Professor McGonagall was standing there,\nfacing him, with the door behind her looking as though it hadn't\never been opened.",
      "And Professor McGonagall held out in one hand a necklace, a thin\ngolden chain bearing in its center a silver circle, within which\nwas the device of an hourglass. In her other hand was a folded\npamphlet. \"This is for you,\" she said.",
      "Wow! He was going to get some sort of neat magical item as a\nquest reward! Apparently that business with refusing offers of\nmonetary rewards until you got a magic item actually worked in real\nlife, not just computer games.",
      "Harry accepted his new necklace, smiling. \"What is it?\"",
      "Professor McGonagall took a breath. \"Mr. Potter, this is an item\nwhich is ordinarily lent only to children who have already shown\nthemselves to be highly responsible, in order to help them with\ndifficult class schedules.\" McGonagall hesitated, as though about\nto add something else. \"I must emphasise, Mr. Potter, that\nthis item's true nature is secret and that you must\nnot tell any of the other students about it, or let them\nsee you using it. If that's not acceptable to you, then you can\ngive it back now.\"",
      "\"I can keep secrets,\" Harry said. \"So what does it do?\"",
      "\"So far as the other students are concerned, this is a Spimster\nwicket and it is used to treat a rare, non-contagious magical\nailment called Spontaneous Duplication. You wear it under your\nclothes, and while you have no reason to show it to anyone, you\nalso have no reason to treat it as an awful secret. Spimster\nwickets are not interesting. Do you understand, Mr. Potter?\"",
      "Harry nodded, his smile widening. He sensed the work of a\ncompetent Slytherin. \"And what does it really\ndo?\"",
      "\"It's a Time-Turner. Each spin of the hourglass sends you one\nhour back in time. So if you use it to go back two hours every day,\nyou should always be able to get to sleep at the same time.\"",
      "Harry's suspension of disbelief blew completely out the\nwindow.",
      "You're giving me a time machine to treat my sleep\ndisorder.",
      "You're giving me a TIME MACHINE to treat my SLEEP\nDISORDER.",
      "YOU'RE GIVING ME A TIME MACHINE IN ORDER TO\nTREAT MY SLEEP DISORDER.",
      "\"Ehehehehhheheh...\" Harry's mouth said. He was now holding the\nnecklace away from him as though it were a live bomb. Well, no, not\nas if it were a live bomb, that didn't begin to describe\nthe severity of the situation. Harry held the necklace away from\nhim as though it were a time machine.",
      "Say, Professor McGonagall, did you know that time-reversed\nordinary matter looks just like antimatter? Why yes it does! Did\nyou know that one kilogram of antimatter encountering one kilogram\nof matter will annihilate in an explosion equivalent to 43 million\ntons of TNT? Do you realise that I myself weigh 41 kilograms and\nthat the resulting blast would leave A GIANT SMOKING CRATER WHERE\nTHERE USED TO BE SCOTLAND?",
      "\"Excuse me,\" Harry managed to say, \"but this sounds really\nreally really REALLY DANGEROUS!\u202f\" Harry's voice didn't\nquite rise to a shriek, he couldn't possibly scream loud enough to\ndo this situation justice so there was no point in trying.",
      "Professor McGonagall looked upon him with tolerant affection.\n\"I'm glad you're taking this seriously, Mr. Potter, but\nTime-Turners aren't that dangerous. We wouldn't give them\nto children if they were.\"",
      "\"Really,\" Harry said. \"Ahahahaha. Of course you wouldn't give\ntime machines to children if they were dangerous, what was\nI thinking? So just to be clear, sneezing on this device will\nnot send me into the Middle Ages where I will run over\nGutenberg with a horse cart and prevent the Enlightenment? Because,\nyou know, I hate it when that happens to me.\"",
      "McGonagall's lips were twitching in that way she had when she\nwas trying not to smile. She offered Harry the pamphlet she was\nholding, but Harry was carefully holding out the necklace with both\nhands and staring at the hourglass to make sure it wasn't about to\nturn. \"Don't worry,\" McGonagall said after a momentary pause, when\nit became clear that Harry wasn't going to move, \"that can't\npossibly happen, Mr. Potter. The Time-Turner cannot be used to move\nmore than six hours backwards. It can't be used more than six times\nin any day.\"",
      "\"Oh, good, very good, that. And if someone bumps into me the\nTime-Turner will not break and will not trap the\nwhole castle of Hogwarts in an endlessly repeating loop of\nThursdays.\"",
      "\"Well, they can be fragile...\" said McGonagall. \"And I\ndo think I've heard about strange things happening if they're\nbroken. But nothing like that!\u202f\"",
      "\"Perhaps,\" Harry said when he could speak again, \"you ought to\nprovide your time machines with some sort of protective\nshell, rather than leaving the glass exposed, so as\nto prevent that from happening.\"",
      "McGonagall looked quite struck. \"That's an excellent idea, Mr.\nPotter. I shall inform the Ministry of it.\"",
      "That's it, it's official now, they've ratified it in\nParliament, everyone in the wizarding world is completely\nstupid.",
      "\"And while I hate to get all PHILOSOPHICAL,\" Harry\ndesperately tried to lower his voice to something under a shriek,\n\"has anyone thought about the IMPLICATIONS of going back\nsix hours and doing something that changes time which would pretty\nmuch DELETE ALL THE PEOPLE AFFECTED and REPLACE THEM\nWITH DIFFERENT VERSIONS -\"",
      "\"Oh, you can't change time!\" Professor McGonagall\ninterrupted. \"Good heavens, Mr. Potter, do you think these would be\nallowed students if that was possible? What if someone\ntried to change their test scores?\"",
      "Harry took a moment to process this. His hands relaxed, just a\nlittle, from their white grip on the hourglass chain. Like he\nwasn't holding a time machine, just a live nuclear warhead.",
      "\"So...\" Harry said slowly. \"People just find that the\nuniverse... happens to be self-consistent, somehow, even though it\nhas time-travel in it. If I and my future self interact then I'll\nsee the same thing as both of me, even though, on my own first run\nthrough, my future self is already acting in full knowledge of\nthings that, from my own perspective, haven't happened yet...\"\nHarry's voice trailed off into the inadequacy of English.",
      "\"Correct, I think,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Although wizards\nare advised to avoid being seen by their past selves. If\nyou're attending two classes at the same time and you need to cross\npaths with yourself, for example, the first version of you should\nstep aside and close his eyes at a known time - you have a watch\nalready, good - so that the future you can pass. It's all there in\nthe pamphlet.\"",
      "\"Ahahahaa. And what happens when someone ignores that\nadvice?\"",
      "Professor McGonagall pursed her lips. \"I understand that it can\nbe quite disconcerting.\"",
      "\"And it doesn't, say, create a paradox that destroys the\nuniverse.\"",
      "She smiled tolerantly. \"Mr. Potter, I think I'd remember hearing\nif that had ever happened.\"",
      "\"THAT IS NOT REASSURING! HAVEN'T YOU PEOPLE EVER HEARD OF\nTHE ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE? AND WHAT IDIOT EVER BUILT ONE OF THESE\nTHINGS FOR THE FIRST TIME?\u202f\"",
      "Professor McGonagall actually laughed. It was a pleasant, glad\nsound that seemed surprisingly out of place on that stern face.\n\"You're having another 'you turned into a cat' moment, aren't you,\nMr. Potter. You probably don't want to hear this, but it's quite\nendearingly cute.\"",
      "\"Turning into a cat doesn't even BEGIN to compare to\nthis. You know right up until this moment I had this awful\nsuppressed thought somewhere in the back of my mind that the only\nremaining answer was that my whole universe was a computer\nsimulation like in the book Simulacron 3 but now even\nthat is ruled out because this little toy ISN'T TURING\nCOMPUTABLE! A Turing machine could simulate going back into a\ndefined moment of the past and computing a different future from\nthere, an oracle machine could rely on the halting behavior of\nlower-order machines, but what you're saying is that reality\nsomehow self-consistently computes in one sweep using information\nthat hasn't... happened... yet...\"",
      "Realisation struck Harry a pile-driver blow.",
      "It all made sense now. It all finally made sense.",
      "\"SO THAT'S HOW THE COMED-TEA WORKS! Of course!\nThe spell doesn't force funny events to happen, it just\nmakes you feel an impulse to drink right before funny\nthings are going to happen anyway! I'm such a fool, I should have\nrealised when I felt the impulse to drink the Comed-Tea before\nDumbledore's second speech, didn't drink it, and then\nchoked on my own saliva instead - drinking the Comed-Tea doesn't\ncause the comedy, the comedy causes you to drink the Comed-Tea! I\nsaw the two events were correlated and assumed the Comed-Tea had to\nbe the cause and the comedy had to be the effect because I thought\ntemporal order restrained causation and causal graphs had to be\nacyclic BUT IT ALL MAKES SENSE ONCE YOU DRAW THE CAUSAL ARROWS\nGOING BACKWARDS IN TIME!\u202f\"",
      "Realisation struck Harry the second pile-driver.",
      "This one he managed to keep quiet, making only a small\nstrangling sound like a dying kitten as he realised who'd put the\nnote on his bed this morning.",
      "Professor McGonagall's eyes were alight. \"After you graduate, or\npossibly even before, you really must teach some of these\nMuggle theories at Hogwarts, Mr. Potter. They sound quite\nfascinating, even if they're all wrong.\"",
      "\"Glehhahhh...\"",
      "Professor McGonagall offered him a few more pleasantries,\ndemanded a few more promises to which Harry nodded, said something\nabout not talking to snakes where anyone could hear him, reminded\nhim to read the pamphlet, and then somehow Harry found himself\nstanding outside her office with the door closed firmly behind\nhim.",
      "\"Gaahhhrrrraa...\" Harry said.",
      "Why yes his mind was blown.",
      "Not least by the fact that, if not for the Prank, he might well\nhave never obtained a Time-Turner in the first place.",
      "Or would Professor McGonagall have given it to him anyway, only\nlater in the day, whenever he got around to asking about his sleep\ndisorder or telling her about the Sorting Hat's message? And would\nhe, at that time, have wanted to pull a prank on himself which\nwould have led to him getting the Time-Turner earlier? So\nthat the only self-consistent possibility was the one in\nwhich the Prank started before he even woke up in the\nmorning...?",
      "Harry found himself considering, for the first time in his life,\nthat the answer to his question might be literally\ninconceivable. That since his own brain contained neurons\nthat only ran forwards in time, there was nothing his\nbrain could do, no operation it could perform, which was conjugate\nto the operation of a Time Turner.",
      "Up until this point Harry had lived by the admonition of E. T.\nJaynes that if you were ignorant about a phenomenon, that was a\nfact about your own state of mind, not a fact about the phenomenon\nitself; that your uncertainty was a fact about you, not a fact\nabout whatever you were uncertain about; that ignorance existed in\nthe mind, not in reality; that a blank map did not correspond to a\nblank territory. There were mysterious questions, but a mysterious\nanswer was a contradiction in terms. A phenomenon could be\nmysterious to some particular person, but there could be\nno phenomena mysterious of themselves. To worship a sacred mystery\nwas just to worship your own ignorance.",
      "So Harry had looked upon magic and refused to be intimidated.\nPeople had no sense of history, they learned about chemistry and\nbiology and astronomy and thought that these matters had always\nbeen the proper meat of science, that they had never been\nmysterious. The stars had once been mysteries. Lord Kelvin had once\ncalled the nature of life and biology - the response of muscles to\nhuman will and the generation of trees from seeds - a mystery\n\"infinitely beyond\" the reach of science. (Not just a little\nbeyond, mind you, but infinitely beyond. Lord Kelvin\ncertainly had felt a huge emotional charge from not knowing\nsomething.) Every mystery ever solved had been a puzzle from\nthe dawn of the human species right up until someone solved it.",
      "Now, for the first time, he was up against the prospect of a\nmystery that was threatening to be permanent. If Time\ndidn't work by acyclic causal networks then Harry didn't understand\nwhat was meant by cause and effect; and if Harry didn't understand\ncauses and effects then he didn't understand what sort of stuff\nreality might be made of instead; and it was entirely possible that\nhis human mind never could understand, because his brain\nwas made of old-fashioned linear-time neurons, and this\nhad turned out to be an impoverished subset of reality.",
      "On the plus side, the Comed-Tea, which had once seemed\nall-powerful and all-unbelievable, had turned out to have a much\nsimpler explanation. Which he'd missed merely because the\ntruth was completely outside his hypothesis space or anything that\nhis brain had evolved to comprehend. But now he actually\nhad figured it, probably. Which was sort of encouraging.\nSort of.",
      "Harry glanced down at his watch. It was nearly 11AM, he'd gotten\nto sleep last night at 1AM, so in the natural state of affairs he'd\ngo to sleep tonight at 3AM. So to go to sleep at 10PM and wake up\nat 7AM, he should go back five hours total. Which meant that if he\nwanted to get back to his dorm at around 6AM, before anyone was\nawake, he'd better hurry up and...",
      "Even in retrospect Harry didn't understand how he'd\npulled off half the stuff involved in the Prank. Where had\nthe pie come from?",
      "Harry was starting to seriously fear time travel.",
      "On the other hand, he had to admit that it had been an\nirreplaceable opportunity. A prank you could only pull on yourself\nonce in a lifetime, within six hours of when you first found out\nabout Time-Turners.",
      "In fact that was even more puzzling, when Harry thought\nabout it. Time had presented him with the finished Prank as a\nfait accompli, and yet it was, quite clearly, his own\nhandiwork. Concept and execution and writing style. Every last\npart, even the ones he still didn't understand.",
      "Well, time was a-wasting and there were at most thirty hours in\na day. Harry did know some of what he had to do, and he\nmight figure out the rest, like the pie, while he was working.\nThere was no point putting it off. He couldn't exactly accomplish\nanything stuck here in the future.",
      "Five hours earlier, Harry was sneaking into his dorm with his\nrobes pulled up over his head as a thin sort of disguise, just in\ncase someone was already up and about and saw him at the same time\nas Harry lying in his bed. He didn't want to have to explain to\nanyone about his little medical problem with Spontaneous\nDuplication.",
      "Fortunately it seemed that everyone was still asleep.",
      "And there also seemed to be a box, wrapped in red and green\npaper with a bright golden ribbon, lying next to his bed. The\nperfect, stereotypical image of a Christmas present, although it\nwasn't Christmas.",
      "Harry crept in as softly as he could manage, just in case\nsomeone had their Quieter turned down low.",
      "There was an envelope attached to the box, closed by plain clear\nwax without a seal impressed.",
      "Harry carefully pried the envelope open, and took out the letter\ninside.",
      "The letter said:",
      "This is the Cloak of Invisibility of Ignotus Peverell,\npassed down through his descendants the Potters. Unlike lesser\ncloaks and spells it has the power to keep you hidden, not merely invisible.\nYour father lent it to me to study shortly before he died, and I\nconfess that I have received much good use of it over the\nyears.",
      "In the future I shall have to get along with\nDisillusionment, I fear. It is time the Cloak was returned to you,\nits heir. I had thought to make this a Christmas present, but it\nwished to come back to your hand before then. It seems to expect\nyou to have need of it. Use it well.",
      "No doubt you are already thinking of all manner of wonderful\npranks, as your father committed in his day. If his full misdeeds\nwere known, every woman in Gryffindor would gather to desecrate his\ngrave. I shall not try to stop history from repeating, but be MOST\ncareful not to reveal yourself. If Dumbledore saw a chance to\npossess one of the Deathly Hallows, he would never let it escape\nhis grasp until the day he died.",
      "A Very Merry Christmas to you.",
      "The note was unsigned.",
      "\"Hold on,\" Harry said, pulling up short as the other boys were\nabout to leave the Ravenclaw dorm. \"Sorry, there's something else\nI've got to do with my trunk. I'll be along to breakfast in a\ncouple of minutes.\"",
      "Terry Boot scowled at Harry. \"You'd better not be planning to go\nthrough any of our things.\"",
      "Harry held up one hand. \"I swear that I intend to do nothing of\nthe sort to any of your things, that I only intend to access\nobjects that I myself own, that I have no pranking or otherwise\nquestionable intentions towards any of you, and that I do not\nanticipate those intentions changing before I get to breakfast in\nthe Great Hall.\"",
      "Terry frowned. \"Wait, is that -\"",
      "\"Don't worry,\" said Penelope Clearwater, who was there to guide\nthem. \"There were no loopholes. Well-worded, Potter, you should be\na lawyer.\"",
      "Harry Potter blinked at that. Ah, yes, Ravenclaw\nprefect. \"Thank you,\" he said. \"I think.\"",
      "\"When you try to find the Great Hall, you will get lost.\"\nPenelope stated this in the tones of a flat, unarguable fact. \"As\nsoon as you do, ask a portrait how to get to the first floor. Ask\nanother portrait the instant you suspect you might be lost\nagain. Especially if it seems like you're going up higher\nand higher. If you are higher than the whole castle ought to be,\nstop and wait for search parties. Otherwise we shall see\nyou again four months later and you will be five months older and\ndressed in a loincloth and covered in snow and that's if you\nstay inside the castle.\"",
      "\"Understood,\" said Harry, swallowing hard. \"Um, shouldn't you\ntell students all that sort of stuff right away?\"",
      "Penelope sighed. \"What, all of it? That would take\nweeks. You'll pick it up as you go along.\" She turned to go,\nfollowed by the other students. \"If I don't see you at breakfast in\nthirty minutes, Potter, I'll start the search.\"",
      "Once everyone was gone, Harry attached the note to his bed -\nhe'd already written it and all the other notes, working in his\ncavern level before everyone else woke up. Then he carefully\nreached inside the Quietus field and pulled the Cloak of\nInvisibility off Harry-1's still-sleeping form.",
      "And just for the sake of mischief, Harry put the Cloak into\nHarry-1's pouch, knowing it would thereby already be in his\nown.",
      "\"I can see that the message is passed on to Cornelion\nFlubberwalt,\" said the painting of a man with aristocratic airs\nand, in fact, a perfectly normal nose. \"But might I ask where it\ncame from originally?\u202f\"",
      "Harry shrugged with artful helplessness. \"I was told that it was\nspoken by a hollow voice that belled forth from a gap within the\nair itself, a gap that opened upon a fiery abyss.\"",
      "\"Hey!\" Hermione said in tones of indignation from her place on\nthe other side of the breakfast table. \"That's everyone's\ndessert! You can't just take one whole pie and put it in your\npouch!\"",
      "\"I'm not taking one pie, I'm taking two. Sorry everyone, gotta\nrun now!\" Harry ignored the cries of outrage and left the Great\nHall. He needed to arrive at Herbology class a little early.",
      "Professor Sprout eyed him sharply. \"And how do you know\nwhat the Slytherins are planning?\"",
      "\"I can't name my source,\" Harry said. \"In fact I have to ask you\nto pretend that this conversation never happened. Just act like you\nhappened across them naturally while you were on an errand, or\nsomething. I'll run on ahead as soon as Herbology gets out. I think\nI can distract the Slytherins until you get there. I'm not easy to\nscare or bully, and I don't think they'll dare to seriously hurt\nthe Boy-Who-Lived. Though... I'm not asking you to run in the\nhallways, but I would appreciate it if you didn't dawdle along the\nway.\"",
      "Professor Sprout looked at him for a long moment, then her\nexpression softened. \"Please be careful with yourself, Harry\nPotter. And... thank you.\"",
      "\"Just be sure not to be late,\" Harry said. \"And remember, when\nyou get there, you weren't expecting to see me and this\nconversation never happened.\"",
      "It was horrible, watching himself yank Neville out of the circle\nof Slytherins. Neville had been right, he'd used too much force,\nway too much force.",
      "\"Hello,\" Harry Potter said coldly. \"I'm the Boy-Who-Lived.\"",
      "Eight first-year boys, mostly the same height. One of them had a\nscar on his forehead and he wasn't acting like the others.",
      "Oh wad some power the giftie gie us\nTo see oursel's as others see us!\nIt wad frae monie a blunder free us,\nAnd foolish notion -",
      "Professor McGonagall was right. The Sorting Hat was right. It\nwas clear once you saw it from the outside.",
      "There was something wrong with Harry Potter."

So after the glass of\nwater had refused to cooperate the first few times, Harry had\nglanced around the Charms classroom to make sure no one was\nwatching, and then taken a deep breath, concentrated, and made\nhimself angry. Thought about the Slytherins bullying Neville, and\nthe game where someone knocked down your books every time you tried\nto pick them up again. Thought about what Draco Malfoy had said\nabout the ten-year-old Lovegood girl and how the Wizengamot really\noperated...",

      "\"Oh, very good, Miss Granger!\" squeaked Filius\nFlitwick, their Charms Professor and Head of Ravenclaw, a tiny\nlittle man with no visible signs of being a past dueling champion.\n\"Excellent! Stupendous!\"",
      "Harry had expected to be, in the worst case, second behind\nHermione. Harry would have preferred for her to be\nrivalling him, of course, but he could have accepted it\nthe other way around.",
      "As of Monday, Harry was headed for the bottom of the class, a\nposition for which he was companionably rivalling all the other\nMuggle-raised students except Hermione. Who was all alone and\nrivalless at the top, poor thing.",
      "Professor Flitwick was standing over the desk of one of the\nother Muggleborns and quietly adjusting the way she was holding her\nwand.",
      "Harry looked over at Hermione. He swallowed hard. It was the\nobvious role for her in the scheme of things... \"Hermione?\" Harry\nsaid tentatively. \"Do you have any idea what I might be doing\nwrong?\"",
      "Hermione's eyes lit up with a terrible light of helpfulness and\nsomething in the back of Harry's brain screamed in desperate\nhumiliation.",
      "Five minutes later, Harry's water did seem noticeably cooler\nthan room temperature and Hermione had given him a few verbal pats\non the head and told him to pronounce it more carefully next time\nand gone off to help someone else.",
      "Professor Flitwick had given her a House point for helping\nhim.",
      "Harry was gritting his teeth so hard his jaw ached and that\nwasn't helping his pronunciation.",
      "I don't care if it's unfair competition. I know exactly what\nI am doing with two extra hours every day. I am going to sit in my\ntrunk and study until I am keeping up with Hermione\nGranger.",
      "\"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic\nyou will learn at Hogwarts,\" said Professor McGonagall. There was\nno trace of any levity upon the face of the stern old witch.\n\"Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back.\nYou have been warned.\"",
      "Her wand came down and tapped her desk, which smoothly reshaped\nitself into a pig. A couple of Muggleborn students gave out small\nyelps. The pig looked around and snorted, seeming confused, and\nthen became a desk again.",
      "The Transfiguration Professor looked around the classroom, and\nthen her eyes settled on one student.",
      "\"Mr. Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"You only received your\nschoolbooks a few days ago. Have you started reading your\nTransfiguration textbook?\"",
      "\"No, sorry professor,\" Harry said.",
      "\"You needn't apologise, Mr. Potter, if you were required to read\nahead you would have been told to do so.\" McGonagall's fingers\nrapped the desk in front of her. \"Mr. Potter, would you care to\nguess whether this is a desk which I Transfigured into a pig, or if\nit began as a pig and I briefly removed the Transfiguration? If you\nhad read the first chapter of your textbook, you would know.\"",
      "Harry's eyebrows furrowed slightly. \"I'd guess it'd be easier to\nstart with a pig, since if it started as a desk, it might not know\nhow to stand up.\"",
      "Professor McGonagall shook her head. \"No fault to you, Mr.\nPotter, but the correct answer is that in Transfiguration you do\nnot care to guess. Wrong answers will be marked with\nextreme severity, questions left blank will be marked with great\nleniency. You must learn to know what you do not know. If I ask you\nany question, no matter how obvious or elementary, and you answer\n'I'm not sure', I will not hold it against you and anyone who\nlaughs will lose House points. Can you tell me why this rule\nexists, Mr. Potter?\"",
      "Because a single error in Transfiguration can be incredibly\ndangerous. \"No.\"",
      "\"Correct. Transfiguration is more dangerous than Apparition,\nwhich is not taught until your sixth year. Unfortunately,\nTransfiguration must be learned and practised at a young age to\nmaximise your adult ability. So this is a dangerous subject, and\nyou should be quite scared of making any mistakes, because none of\nmy students have ever been permanently injured and I will be\nextremely put out if you are the first class to spoil\nmy record.\"",
      "Several students gulped.",
      "Professor McGonagall stood up and moved over to the wall behind\nher desk, which held a polished wooden board. \"There are many\nreasons why Transfiguration is dangerous, but one reason stands\nabove all the rest.\" She produced a short quill with a thick end,\nand used it to sketch letters in red; which she then underlined,\nusing the same marker, in blue:",
      "TRANSFIGURATION IS NOT\nPERMANENT!",
      "\"Transfiguration is not permanent!\" said Professor McGonagall.\n\"Transfiguration is not permanent! Transfiguration is not\npermanent! Mr. Potter, suppose a student Transfigured a block of\nwood into a cup of water, and you drank it. What do you imagine\nmight happen to you when the Transfiguration wore off?\" There was a\npause. \"Excuse me, I should not have asked that of you, Mr. Potter,\nI forgot that you are blessed with an unusually pessimistic\nimagination -\"",
      "\"I'm fine,\" Harry said, swallowing hard. \"So the first answer is\nthat I don't know,\" the Professor nodded approvingly, \"but\nI imagine there might be... wood in my stomach, and in my\nbloodstream, and if any of that water had gotten absorbed into my\nbody's tissues - would it be wood pulp or solid wood or...\" Harry's\ngrasp of magic failed him. He couldn't understand how wood mapped\ninto water in the first place, so he couldn't understand what would\nhappen after the water molecules were scrambled by ordinary thermal\nmotions and the magic wore off and the mapping reversed.",
      "McGonagall's face was stiff. \"As Mr. Potter has correctly\nreasoned, he would become extremely sick and require immediate\nFlooing to St. Mungo's Hospital if he was to have any chance of\nsurvival. Please turn your textbooks to page 5.\"",
      "Even without any sound in the moving picture, you could tell\nthat the woman with horribly discolored skin was screaming.",
      "\"The criminal who originally Transfigured gold into wine and\ngave it to this woman to drink, 'in payment of the debt' as he put\nit, received a sentence of ten years in Azkaban. Please turn to\npage 6. That is a Dementor. They are the guardians of Azkaban. They\nsuck away at your magic, your life, and any happy thoughts you try\nto have. The picture on page 7 is of the criminal ten years later,\non his release. You will note that he is dead - yes, Mr.\nPotter?\"",
      "\"Professor,\" Harry said, \"if the worst happens in a case like\nthat, is there any way of maintaining the\nTransfiguration?\"",
      "\"No,\" Professor McGonagall said flatly. \"Sustaining a\nTransfiguration is a constant drain on your magic which scales with\nthe size of the target form. And you would need to recontact the\ntarget every few hours, which is, in a case like this, impossible.\nDisasters like this are unrecoverable!\u202f\"",
      "Professor McGonagall leaned forwards, her face very hard. \"You\nwill absolutely never under any circumstances Transfigure anything\ninto a liquid or a gas. No water, no air. Nothing like water,\nnothing like air. Even if it is not meant to drink. Liquid\nevaporates, little bits and pieces of it get into the air.\nYou will not Transfigure anything that is to be burned. It will\nmake smoke and someone could breathe that smoke! You will never\nTransfigure anything that could conceivably go inside anyone's body\nby any means. No food. Nothing that looks like food. Not\neven as a funny little prank where you mean to tell them about your\nmud pie before they actually eat it. You will never do it. Period.\nInside this classroom or out of it or anywhere. Is that\nwell understood by every single student?\u202f\"",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harry, Hermione, and a few others. The rest seemed\nto be speechless.",
      "\"Is that well understood by every single student?\u202f\"",
      "\"Yes,\" they said or muttered or whispered.",
      "\"If you break any of these rules you will not further study\nTransfiguration during your stay at Hogwarts. Repeat along with me.\nI will never Transfigure anything into a liquid or gas.\"",
      "\"I will never Transfigure anything into a liquid or gas,\" said\nthe students in ragged chorus.",
      "\"Again! Louder! I will never Transfigure anything into a liquid\nor gas.\"",
      "\"I will never Transfigure anything into a liquid or gas.\"",
      "\"I will never Transfigure anything that looks like food or\nanything else that goes inside a human body.\"",
      "\"I will never Transfigure anything that is to be burned because\nit could make smoke.\"",
      "\"You will never Transfigure anything that looks like money,\nincluding Muggle money,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"The goblins\nhave ways of finding out who did it. As a matter of recognised law,\nthe goblin nation is in a permanent state of war with all\nmagical counterfeiters. They will not send Aurors. They will send\nan army.\"",
      "\"I will never Transfigure anything that looks like money,\"\nrepeated the students.",
      "\"And above all,\" said Professor McGonagall, \"you will\nnot Transfigure any living subject, especially yourselves.\nIt will make you very sick and possibly dead, depending on how you\nTransfigure yourself and how long you maintain the change.\"\nProfessor McGonagall paused. \"Mr. Potter is currently holding up\nhis hand because he has seen an Animagus transformation -\nspecifically, a human transforming into a cat and back again. But\nan Animagus transformation is not free\nTransfiguration.\"",
      "Professor McGonagall took a small chunk of wood out of her\npocket. With a tap of her wand it became a glass ball. Then she\nsaid \"Crystferrium!\u202f\" and the glass ball became a steel\nball. She tapped it with her wand one last time and the steel ball\nbecame a piece of wood once more. \"Crystferrium transforms\na subject of solid glass into a similarly shaped target of solid\nsteel. It cannot do the reverse, nor can it transform a desk into a\npig. The most general form of Transfiguration - free\nTransfiguration, which you will be learning here - is capable of\ntransforming any subject into any target, at least so far as\nphysical form is concerned. For this reason, free Transfiguration\nmust be done wordlessly. Using Charms would require different words\nfor every different transformation between subject and target.\"",
      "Professor McGonagall gave her students a sharp look.\n\"Some teachers begin with Transfiguration Charms and move\non to free Transfiguration afterwards. Yes, that would be much\neasier in the beginning. But it can set you in a poor mold which\nimpairs your abilities later. Here you will learn free\nTransfiguration from the very start, which requires that\nyou cast the spell wordlessly, by holding the subject form, the\ntarget form, and the transformation within your own mind.\"",
      "\"And to answer Mr. Potter's question,\" Professor McGonagall went\non, \"it is free Transfiguration which you must never do to\nany living subject. There are Charms and potions which can safely,\nreversibly transform living subjects in limited ways. An\nAnimagus with a missing limb will still be missing that limb after\ntransforming, for example. Free Transfiguration is not\nsafe. Your body will change while it is Transfigured - breathing,\nfor example, results in a constant loss of the body's stuff to the\nsurrounding air. When the Transfiguration wears off and your body\ntries to revert to its original form, it will not quite be\nable to do so. If you press your wand to your body and imagine\nyourself with golden hair, afterwards your hair will fall out. If\nyou visualise yourself as someone with clearer skin, you will be\ntaking a long stay at St. Mungo's. And if you Transfigure yourself\ninto an adult bodily form, then, when the Transfiguration wears\noff, you will die.\"",
      "That explained why he had seen such things as fat boys, or girls\nless than perfectly pretty. Or old people, for that matter. That\nwouldn't happen if you could just Transfigure yourself every\nmorning... Harry raised his hand and tried to signal Professor\nMcGonagall with his eyes.",
      "\"Yes, Mr. Potter?\"",
      "\"Is it possible to Transfigure a living subject into a target\nthat is static, such as a coin - no, excuse me, I'm terribly sorry,\nlet's just say a steel ball.\"",
      "Professor McGonagall shook her head. \"Mr. Potter, even inanimate\nobjects undergo small internal changes over time. There would be no\nvisible changes to your body afterwards, and for the first minute,\nyou would notice nothing wrong. But in an hour you would be sick,\nand in a day you would be dead.\"",
      "\"Erm, excuse me, so if I'd read the first chapter I could have\nguessed that the desk was originally a desk and not a\npig,\" Harry said, \"but only if I made the further\nassumption that you didn't want to kill the pig, that might\nseem highly probable but -\"",
      "\"I can foresee that marking your tests will be an endless source\nof delight to me, Mr. Potter. But if you have other questions can I\nplease ask you to wait until after class?\"",
      "\"No further questions, professor.\"",
      "\"Now repeat after me,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"I will never\ntry to Transfigure any living subject, especially myself, unless\nspecifically instructed to do so using a specialised Charm or\npotion.\"",
      "\"If I am not sure whether a Transfiguration is safe, I will not\ntry it until I have asked Professor McGonagall or Professor\nFlitwick or Professor Snape or the Headmaster, who are the only\nrecognised authorities on Transfiguration at Hogwarts. Asking\nanother student is not acceptable, even if they say that\nthey remember asking the same question.\"",
      "\"Even if the current Defence Professor at Hogwarts tells me that\na Transfiguration is safe, and even if I see the Defence Professor\ndo it and nothing bad seems to happen, I will not try it\nmyself.\"",
      "\"I have the absolute right to refuse to perform any\nTransfiguration about which I feel the slightest bit nervous. Since\nnot even the Headmaster of Hogwarts can order me to do otherwise, I\ncertainly will not accept any such order from the Defence\nProfessor, even if the Defence Professor threatens to deduct one\nhundred House points and have me expelled.\"",
      "\"If I break any of these rules I will not further study\nTransfiguration during my time at Hogwarts.\"",
      "\"We will repeat these rules at the start of every class for the\nfirst month,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"And now, we will begin\nwith matches as subjects and needles as targets... put away your\nwands, thank you, by 'begin' I meant that you will begin taking\nnotes.\"",
      "Half an hour before the end of class, Professor McGonagall\nhanded out the matches.",
      "At the end of the class Hermione had a silvery-looking match and\nthe entire rest of the class, Muggleborn or otherwise, had exactly\nwhat they'd started with.",
      "Professor McGonagall awarded her another point for\nRavenclaw.",
      "After the Transfiguration class was dismissed, Hermione came\nover to Harry's desk as Harry was putting away his books into his\npouch.",
      "\"You know,\" Hermione said with an innocent expression on her\nface, \"I earned two points for Ravenclaw today.\"",
      "\"So you did,\" Harry said shortly.",
      "\"But that wasn't as good as your seven points,\" she\nsaid. \"I guess I'm just not as intelligent as you.\"",
      "Harry finished feeding his homework into the pouch and turned to\nHermione with his eyes narrowed. He'd actually forgotten about\nthat.",
      "She batted her eyelashes at him. \"We have lessons every\nday, though. I wonder how long it will take you to find some more\nHufflepuffs to rescue? Today is Monday. So that gives you until\nThursday.\"",
      "The two of them stared into each other's eyes, unblinking.",
      "Harry spoke first. \"Of course you realise this means war.\"",
      "\"I didn't know we'd been at peace.\"",
      "All of the other students were now watching with fascinated\neyes. All of the other students, plus, unfortunately, Professor\nMcGonagall.",
      "\"Oh, Mr. Potter,\" sang Professor McGonagall from the other side\nof the room, \"I have some good news for you. Madam Pomfrey has\napproved your suggestion for preventing breakage in her Spimster\nwickets, and the plan is to finish the job by the end of next week.\nI'd say that deserves... let's call it ten points for\nRavenclaw.\"",
      "Hermione's face was gaping in betrayal and shock. Harry imagined\nhis own face didn't look much different.",
      "\"Professor...\" Harry hissed.",
      "\"Those ten points are unquestionably deserved, Mr.\nPotter. I would not hand out House points on a whim. To you it\nmight have been a simple matter of seeing something fragile and\nsuggesting a way to protect it, but Spimster wickets are expensive,\nand the Headmaster was not pleased the last time one\nbroke.\" Professor McGonagall looked thoughtful. \"My, I wonder if\nany other student has ever earned seventeen House points on his\nfirst day of lessons. I'll have to look it up, but I suspect that's\na new record. Perhaps we should have an announcement at\ndinnertime?\"",
      "\"PROFESSOR!\u202f\" Harry shrieked. \"This is our\nwar! Stop meddling!\"",
      "\"Now you have until Thursday of next week, Mr. Potter.\nUnless, of course, you engage in some sort of mischief and\nlose House points before then. Addressing a professor\ndisrespectfully, for example.\" Professor McGonagall put a finger on\nher cheek and looked reflective. \"I expect you'll hit negative\nnumbers before the end of Friday.\"",
      "Harry's mouth snapped shut. He sent his best Death Glare at\nMcGonagall but she only seemed to find it amusing.",
      "\"Yes, definitely an announcement at dinner,\" Professor\nMcGonagall mused. \"But it wouldn't do to offend the Slytherins, so\nthe announcement should be brief. Just the number of points and the\nfact of the record... and if anyone comes to you for help with\ntheir schoolwork and is disappointed that you haven't even started\nreading your textbooks, you can always refer them to Miss\nGranger.\"",
      "\"Professor!\u202f\" said Hermione in a rather high-pitched\nvoice.",
      "Professor McGonagall ignored her. \"My, I wonder how long it will\ntake before Miss Granger does something deserving of a dinnertime\nannouncement? I look forward to seeing it, whatever it may be.\"",
      "Harry and Hermione, by unspoken mutual consent, turned and\nstormed out of the classroom. They were followed by a trail of\nhypnotised Ravenclaws.",
      "\"Um,\" Harry said. \"Are we still on for after dinner?\"",
      "\"Of course,\" said Hermione. \"I wouldn't want you to fall further\nbehind on your studying.\"",
      "\"Why, thank you. And let me say that as brilliant as you are\nalready, I can't help but wonder what you'll be like once you have\nsome elementary training in rationality.\"",
      "\"Is it really that useful? It didn't seem to help you with\nCharms or Transfiguration.\"",
      "There was a slight pause.",
      "\"Well, I only got my schoolbooks four days ago. That's why I had\nto earn those seventeen House points without using my wand.\"",
      "\"Four days ago? Maybe you can't read eight books in four days\nbut you might have at least read one. How many days will\nit take to finish at that rate? You know all that mathematics, so\ncan you tell me what's eight, times four, divided by zero?\"",
      "\"I've got classes now, which you didn't, but weekends are free,\nso... limit of eight times four divided by epsilon as epsilon\napproaches zero plus... 10:47AM on Sunday.\"",
      "\"I did it in three days actually.\"",
      "\"2:47PM on Saturday it is, then. I'm sure I'll find the time\nsomewhere.\"",
      "And there was evening and there was morning, the first day."

      "I'm not a psychopath, I'm just very creative.",
      "As soon as he walked into the Defence classroom on Wednesday,\nHarry knew that this subject was going to be\ndifferent.",
      "It was, for a start, the largest classroom he had yet seen at\nHogwarts, akin to a major university classroom, with layered tiers\nof desks facing a gigantic flat stage of white marble. The\nclassroom was high up in the castle - on the fifth floor - and\nHarry knew that was as much explanation as he'd get for where a\nroom like this was supposed to fit. It was becoming clear that\nHogwarts simply did not have a geometry, Euclidean or\notherwise; it had connections, not directions.",
      "Unlike a university hall, there weren't rows of folding seats;\ninstead there were quite ordinary Hogwarts wooden desks and wooden\nchairs, lined up in a curve across each level of the classroom.\nExcept that each desk had a flat, white, rectangular, mysterious\nobject propped up on it.",
      "In the center of the gigantic platform, on a small raised dais\nof darker marble, was a lone teacher's desk. At which Quirrell sat\nslumped over in his chair, head lolled back, drooling slightly over\nhis robes.",
      "Now what does that remind me of...?",
      "Harry had arrived at the lesson so early that no other students\nwere there yet. (The English language was defective when it came to\ndescribing time travel; in particular, English lacked any words\ncapable of expressing how convenient it was.) Quirrell didn't seem\nto be... functional... at the moment, and Harry didn't particularly\nfeel like approaching Quirrell anyway.",
      "Harry selected a desk, climbed up to it, sat down, and retrieved\nthe Defence textbook. He was around seven-eighths of the way\nthrough - he'd planned on finishing the book before this lesson,\nactually, but he was running behind schedule and had already used\nthe Time-Turner twice today.",
      "Soon there were sounds as the classroom began to fill up. Harry\nignored them.",
      "\"Potter? What are you doing here?\"",
      "That voice didn't belong here. Harry looked up. \"Draco?\nWhat are you doing in oh my god you have\nminions.\"",
      "One of the lads standing behind Draco seemed to have rather a\nlot of muscle for an eleven-year-old, and the other was poised in a\nsuspiciously balanced-looking stance.",
      "The white-blonde-haired boy smiled rather smugly and gestured\nbehind him. \"Potter, I introduce to you Mr. Crabbe,\" his hand moved\nfrom Muscles to Balance, \"Mr. Goyle. Vincent, Gregory, this is\nHarry Potter.\"",
      "Mr. Goyle tilted his head and gave Harry a look that was\nprobably supposed to mean something but ended up just looking\nsquinty. Mr. Crabbe said \"Please to meetcha\" in a tone that sounded\nlike he was trying to lower his voice as far as it could go.",
      "A fleeting expression of consternation crossed Draco's face, but\nwas quickly replaced by his superior grin.",
      "\"You have minions!\u202f\" Harry repeated. \"Where do\nI get minions?\"",
      "Draco's smirk grew wider. \"I'm afraid, Potter, that the first\nstep is to be Sorted into Slytherin -\"",
      "\"What? That's not fair!\"",
      "\"- and then for your families to have an arrangement from before\nyou were born.\"",
      "Harry looked at Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle. They both seemed to be\ntrying very hard to loom. That is, they were leaning forwards,\nhunching over their shoulders, sticking their necks out and staring\nat him.",
      "\"Um... hold on,\" said Harry. \"This was arranged years\nago?\"",
      "\"Exactly, Potter. I'm afraid you're out of luck.\"",
      "Mr. Goyle produced a toothpick and began cleaning his teeth,\nstill looming.",
      "\"And,\" said Harry, \"Lucius insisted that you were not\nto grow up knowing your bodyguards, and that you were only to meet\nthem on your first day of school.\"",
      "That wiped the grin from Draco's face. \"Yes, Potter, we all know\nyou're brilliant, the whole school knows by now, you can stop\nshowing off -\"",
      "\"So they've been told their whole lives that they're\ngoing to be your minions and they've spent years imagining\nwhat minions are supposed to be like -\"",
      "Draco winced.",
      "\"- and what's worse, they do know each other\nand they've been practising -\"",
      "\"The boss told ya to shut it,\" rumbled Mr. Crabbe. Mr. Goyle bit\ndown on his toothpick, holding it between his teeth, and used one\nhand to crack the knuckles on the other.",
      "\"I told you not to do this in front of Harry\nPotter!\"",
      "The two looked a bit sheepish and Mr. Goyle quickly put the\ntoothpick back in a pocket of his robes.",
      "But the moment Draco turned away from them to face Harry again,\nthey went back to looming.",
      "\"I apologise,\" Draco said stiffly, \"for the insult which these\nimbeciles have offered you.\"",
      "Harry gave a meaningful look to Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle. \"I'd\nsay you're being a little harsh on them, Draco. I think\nthey're acting exactly the way I'd want my minions to act.\nI mean, if I had any minions.\"",
      "Draco's jaw dropped.",
      "\"Hey, Gregory, you don' think he's tryna lure us away from the\nboss, do ya?\"",
      "\"I'm sure Mr. Potter wouldn't be that foolish.\"",
      "\"Oh, I wouldn't dream of it,\" Harry said smoothly. \"It's just\nsomething to keep in mind if your current employer seems\nunappreciative. Besides, it never hurts to have other offers while\nyou're negotiating your working conditions, right?\"",
      "\"What's he doin' in Ravenclaw?\"",
      "\"I can't imagine, Mr. Crabbe.\"",
      "\"Both of you shut up,\" Draco said through gritted\nteeth. \"That's an order.\" With a visible effort, he\ntransferred his attention to Harry again. \"Anyway, what're you\ndoing in the Slytherin Defence class?\"",
      "Harry frowned. \"Hold on.\" His hand went into his pouch.\n\"Timetable.\" He looked over the parchment. \"Defence, 2:30pm, and\nright now it's...\" Harry looked at his mechanical watch, which read\n11:23. \"2:23, unless I've lost track of time. Did I?\" If he had,\nwell, Harry knew how to get to whatever lesson he was\nsupposed to be at. God he loved his Time-Turner and\nsomeday, when he was old enough, they would get married.",
      "\"No, that sounds right,\" Draco said, looking puzzled. His gaze\nturned to look over the rest of the auditorium, which was filling\nwith green-trimmed robes and...",
      "\"Gryffindorks!\u202f\" spat Draco. \"What're they\ndoing here?\"",
      "\"Hm,\" Harry said. \"Professor Quirrell did say... I forget his\nexact words... that he would be ignoring some of the Hogwarts\nteaching conventions. Maybe he just combined all his classes.\"",
      "\"Huh,\" said Draco. \"You're the first Ravenclaw in here.\"",
      "\"Yup. Got here early.\"",
      "\"What're you doing all the way in the back row, then?\"",
      "Harry blinked. \"I dunno, seemed like a good place to sit?\"",
      "Draco made a scoffing sound. \"You couldn't get any further away\nfrom the teacher if you tried.\" The blonde-haired boy leaned\nslightly closer. \"Anyway, is it true about what you said to Derrick\nand his crew?\"",
      "\"Who's Derrick?\"",
      "\"You hit him with a pie?\"",
      "\"Two pies, actually. What am I supposed to have said to\nhim?\"",
      "\"That he wasn't doing anything cunning or ambitious and he was a\ndisgrace to Salazar Slytherin.\" Draco was staring intently at\nHarry.",
      "\"That... sounds about right,\" Harry said. \"I think it was more\nlike, 'is this some kind of incredibly clever plot that will gain\nyou a future advantage or is it really as much of a disgrace to the\nmemory of Salazar Slytherin as it looks like' or something like\nthat. I don't remember the exact words.\"",
      "\"You're confusing everyone, you know,\" said the blonde-haired\nboy.",
      "\"Huh?\" Harry said in honest confusion.",
      "\"Warrington said that spending a long time under the Sorting Hat\nis one of the warning signs of a major Dark Wizard. Everyone was\ntalking about it, wondering if they should start sucking up to you\njust in case. Then you went and protected a bunch of\nHufflepuffs, for Merlin's sake. Then you told\nDerrick he's a disgrace to Salazar Slytherin's memory! What's\nanyone supposed to think?\"",
      "\"That the Sorting Hat decided to put me in the House of\n'Slytherin! Just kidding! Ravenclaw!' and I've been acting\naccordingly.\"",
      "Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle both giggled, causing Mr. Goyle to\nquickly clap a hand to his mouth.",
      "\"We'd better go get our seats,\" Draco said. He hesitated,\nstraightened a bit, spoke a bit more fomally. \"But I do want to\ncontinue our last conversation and I accept your conditions.\"",
      "Harry nodded. \"Would you mind terribly if I waited until\nSaturday afternoon? I'm in a bit of a contest right now.\"",
      "\"A contest?\"",
      "\"See if I can read all my textbooks as fast as Hermione Granger\ndid.\"",
      "\"Granger,\" Draco echoed. His eyes narrowed. \"The mudblood who\nthinks she's Merlin?

      "Oh, this is going to be so much fun to juggle, I\ncan already tell.",
      "The classroom was filling up rapidly now with all four colors of\ntrim: green, red, yellow, and blue. Draco and his two friends\nseemed to be in the midst of trying to acquire three contiguous\nfront-row seats - already occupied, of course. Mr. Crabbe and Mr.\nGoyle were looming vigorously, but it didn't seem to be having much\neffect.",
      "Harry bent over his Defence textbook and continued reading.",
      "At 2:35PM, when most of the seats were taken and no one else\nseemed to be coming in, Professor Quirrell gave a sudden jerk in\nhis chair and sat up straight, and his face appeared on all the\nflat, white rectangular objects that were propped up on the\nstudents' desks.",
      "Harry was taken by surprise, both by the sudden appearance of\nProfessor Quirrell's face and by the resemblance to Muggle\ntelevision. There was something both nostalgic and sad about that,\nit seemed so much like a piece of home and yet it wasn't\nreally...",
      "\"Good afternoon, my young apprentices,\" said Professor Quirrell.\nHis voice seemed to come from the desk screen and to be speaking\ndirectly to Harry. \"Welcome to your first lesson in Battle Magic,\nas the founders of Hogwarts would have put it; or, as it happens to\nbe called in the late twentieth century, Defence Against the Dark\nArts.\"",
      "There was a certain amount of frantic scrabbling as students,\ntaken by surprise, reached for their parchment or notebooks.",
      "\"No,\" Professor Quirrell said. \"Don't bother writing down what\nthis subject was once called. No such pointless question will count\ntoward your marks in any of my lessons. That is a promise.\"",
      "Many students sat straight up at that, looking rather\nshocked.",

      "Someone made a choking sound. Harry wondered if it was\nHermione.",
      "\"- may have gotten the impression that although this subject is\ncalled Defence Against the Dark Arts, it is actually about how to\ndefend against Nightmare Butterflies, which cause mildly bad\ndreams, or Acid Slugs, which can dissolve all the way through a\ntwo-inch wooden beam given most of a day.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell stood up, shoving his chair back from the\ndesk. The screen on Harry's desk followed his every move. Professor\nQuirrell strode towards the front of the classroom, and\nbellowed:",
      "\"The Hungarian Horntail is taller than a dozen men! It breathes\nfire so quickly and so accurately that it can melt a Snitch in\nmidflight! One Killing Curse will bring it down!\"",
      "There were gasps from the students.",
      "\"The Mountain Troll is more dangerous than the Hungarian\nHorntail! It is strong enough to bite through steel! Its hide is\nresistant enough to withstand Stunning Hexes and Cutting Charms!\nIts sense of smell is so acute that it can tell from afar whether\nits prey is part of a pack, or alone and vulnerable! Most fearsome\nof all, the troll is unique among magical creatures in continuously\nmaintaining a form of Transfiguration on itself - it is always\ntransforming into its own body. If you somehow succeed in ripping\noff its arm it will grow another within seconds! Fire and acid will\nproduce scar tissue which can temporarily confuse a troll's\nregenerative powers - for an hour or two! They are smart enough to\nuse clubs as tools! The mountain troll is the third most perfect\nkilling machine in all Nature! One Killing Curse will bring it\ndown.\"",
      "The students were looking rather shocked.",
      "Professor Quirrell was smiling rather grimly. \"Your sad excuse\nfor a third-year Defence textbook will suggest to you that you\nexpose the mountain troll to sunlight, which will freeze it in\nplace. This, my young apprentices, is the sort of useless knowledge\nyou will never find in my lessons. You do not encounter mountain\ntrolls in open daylight! The idea that you should use sunlight to\nstop them is the result of foolish textbook authors trying to show\noff their mastery of minutia at the expense of practicality. Just\nbecause there is a ridiculously obscure way of dealing with\nmountain trolls does not mean you should actually try to use it!\nThe Killing Curse is unblockable, unstoppable, and works every\nsingle time on anything with a brain. If, as an adult wizard, you\nfind yourself incapable of using the Killing Curse, then you can\nsimply Apparate away! Likewise if you are facing the second most\nperfect killing machine, a Dementor. You just Apparate away!\"",
      "\"Unless, of course,\" Professor Quirrell said, his voice now\nlower and harder, \"you are under the influence of an\nanti-Apparition jinx. No, there is exactly one monster which can\nthreaten you once you are fully grown. The single most dangerous\nmonster in all the world, so dangerous that nothing else comes\nclose. The Dark Wizard. That is the only thing that will still be\nable to threaten you.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell's lips were set in a thin line. \"I will\nreluctantly teach you enough trivia for a passing mark on the\nMinistry-mandated portions of your first-year finals.

Which\nmeans, let us be very clear on this, defending yourselves against\nDark Wizards. People with wands who want to hurt you and who will\nlikely succeed in doing so unless you hurt them first! There is no\ndefence without offence! There is no defence without fighting! This\nreality is deemed too harsh for eleven-year-olds by the fat,\noverpaid, Auror-guarded politicians who mandated your curriculum.\nTo the abyss with those fools! You are here for the subject that\nhas been taught at Hogwarts for eight hundred years! Welcome to\nyour first year of Battle Magic!\"",
      "Harry started applauding. He couldn't help himself, it was too\ninspiring.",
      "Once Harry started clapping there was some scattered response\nfrom Gryffindor, and more from Slytherin, but most students simply\nseemed too stunned to react.",
      "Professor Quirrell made a cutting gesture, and the applause died\ninstantly. \"Thank you very much,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"Now to\npracticalities. I have combined all my first-year Battle classes\ninto one, which allows me to offer you twice as much classroom time\nas Doubles sessions -\"",

      "The gasps of horror cut off abruptly.",

      "Harry desperately wished he'd sat next to Hermione so he could\nsee the look on her face now, but on the other hand he was pretty\nsure he was imagining it accurately.",
      "Also Harry was in love. It would be a three-way wedding: him,\nthe Time-Turner, and Professor Quirrell.",
      "\"For those of you who so choose, I have arranged some\nafter-school activities that I think you will find quite\ninteresting as well as educational.

      "Hot damn.",
      "\"These and other after-school activities will also earn you\nQuirrell points. What are Quirrell points, you ask? The House point\nsystem does not suit my needs, because it makes House points too\nrare. I prefer to let my students know how they are doing more\nfrequently than that. And on the rare occasions I offer you a\nwritten test, it will mark itself as you go along, and if you get\ntoo many related questions wrong, your test will show the names of\nstudents who got those questions right, and those students will be\nable to earn Quirrell points by helping you.\"",

      "\"What good are Quirrell points, you wonder? For a start, ten\nQuirrell points will be worth one House point. But they will earn\nyou other favors as well.

      "\"Now leave your books and loose items at your desks - they will\nbe safe, the screens will watch over them for you - and come down\nonto this platform. It's time to play a game called Who's the Most\nDangerous Student in the Classroom.\"",
      "Harry twisted his wand in his right hand and said\n\"Ma-ha-su!\u202f\"",
      "There was another high-pitched \"bing\" from the floating blue\nsphere that Professor Quirrell had assigned to Harry as his target.\nThat particular sound meant a perfect strike, which Harry had been\ngotten on nine out of his last ten attempts.",
      "Somewhere Professor Quirrell had dug up a spell that was\nincredibly easy to pronounce, and had a ridiculously\nsimple wand motion, and had a tendency to hit wherever you\nwere currently looking at. Professor Quirrell had disdainfully\nproclaimed that real battle magic was far more difficult than this.\nThat the hex was entirely useless in actual combat. That it was a\nbarely ordered burst of magic whose only real content was the\naiming, and that it would produce, when it hit, a pain briefly\nequivalent to being punched hard in the nose. That the sole purpose\nof this test was to see who was a fast learner, since Professor\nQuirrell was certain no one would have previously encountered this\nhex or anything like it.",
      "Harry didn't care about any of that.",
      "\"Ma-ha-su!\u202f\"",
      "A red bolt of energy shot out of his wand and struck\nthe target and the blue sphere once again made the bing which meant\nthe spell had actually worked for him.",
      "Harry was feeling like a real wizard for the first time since\nhe'd come to Hogwarts. He wished the target would dodge like the\nlittle spheres that Ben Kenobi had used for training Luke, but for\nsome reason Professor Quirrell had instead lined up all the\nstudents and targets in neat orders which made sure they wouldn't\nfire on each other.",
      "So Harry lowered his wand, skipped to the right, snapped up his\nwand and twisted and shouted \"Ma-ha-su!\u202f\"",
      "There was a lower-pitched \"dong\" which meant he'd gotten it\nalmost right.",
      "Harry put his wand into his pocket, skipped back to the left and\ndrew and fired another red bolt of energy.",
      "The high-pitched bing which resulted was easily one of the most\nsatisfying sounds he'd heard in his life. Harry wanted to scream in\ntriumph at the top of his lungs. I CAN DO MAGIC! FEAR ME, LAWS\nOF PHYSICS, I'M COMING TO VIOLATE YOU!",
      "\"Ma-ha-su!\u202f\" Harry's voice was loud, but hardly\nnoticeable over the steady chant of similar cries from around the\nclassroom platform.",
      "\"Enough,\" said Professor Quirrell's amplified voice. (It didn't\nsound loud. It sounded like normal volume, coming from just behind\nyour left shoulder, no matter where you were standing relative to\nProfessor Quirrell.) \"I see that all of you have succeeded at least\nonce now.\" The target-spheres turned red and began to drift up\ntowards the ceiling.",
      "Professor Quirrell was standing on the raised dais in the center\nof the platform, leaning slightly on his teacher's desk with one\nhand.",
      "\"I told you,\" Professor Quirrell said, \"that we would play a\ngame called Who's the Most Dangerous Student in the Classroom.\nThere is one student in this classroom who mastered the Sumerian\nSimple Strike Hex faster than anyone else -\"",
      "Oh blah blah blah.",
      "\"- and went on to help seven other students. For which she has\nearned the first seven Quirrell points awarded to your year. Come\nforth, Hermione Granger. It is time for the next stage of the\ngame.\"",
      "Hermione Granger began striding forwards, a mixed look of\ntriumph and apprehension on her face. The Ravenclaws looked on\nproudly, the Slytherins with glares, and Harry with frank\nannoyance. Harry had done fine this time. He was probably even in\nthe upper half of the class, now that everyone had been faced with\nan equally unfamiliar spell and Harry had read all the way through\nAdalbert Waffling's Magical Theory. And yet Hermione\nwas still doing better.",
      "Somewhere in the back of his mind was the fear that Hermione was\nsimply smarter than him.",
      "But for now Harry was going to pin his hopes on the known facts\nthat (a) Hermione had read a lot more than the standard textbooks\nand (b) Adalbert Waffling was an uninspired sod who'd written\nMagical Theory to pander to a school board that didn't\nthink much of eleven-year-olds.",
      "Hermione reached the central dais and stepped up.",
      "\"Hermione Granger mastered a completely unfamiliar spell in two\nminutes, almost a full minute faster than the next runner-up.\"\nProfessor Quirrell turned slowly in place to look at all the\nstudents watching them. \"Could Miss Granger's intelligence make her\nthe most dangerous student in the classroom? Well? What do you\nthink?\"",
      "No one seemed to be thinking anything at the moment. Even Harry\nwasn't sure what to say.",
      "\"Let's find out, shall we?\" said Professor Quirrell. He turned\nback to Hermione, and gestured toward the wider class. \"Select any\nstudent you like and cast the Simple Strike Hex on them.\"",
      "Hermione froze where she stood.",
      "\"Come now,\" Professor Quirrell said smoothly. \"You have cast\nthis spell perfectly over fifty times. It is not permanently\nharmful or even all that painful. It hurts as much as a hard punch\nand lasts only a few seconds.\" Professor Quirrell's voice grew\nharder. \"This is a direct order from your professor, Miss Granger.\nChoose a target and fire a Simple Strike Hex.\"",
      "Hermione's face was screwed up in horror and her wand was\ntrembling in her hand. Harry's own fingers were clenching his own\nwand hard in sympathy. Even though he could see what Professor\nQuirrell was trying to do. Even though he could see the point\nProfessor Quirrell was trying to make.",
      "\"If you do not raise your wand and fire, Miss Granger,\nyou will lose a Quirrell point.\"",
      "Harry stared at Hermione, willing her to look in his direction.\nHis right hand was softly tapping his own chest. Pick me, I'm\nnot afraid...",
      "Hermione's wand twitched in her hand; then her face relaxed, and\nshe lowered her wand to her side.",
      "\"No,\" said Hermione Granger.",
      "Her voice was calm, and even though it wasn't loud, everyone\nheard it in the silence.",
      "\"Then I must deduct one point from you,\" said Professor\nQuirrell. \"This is a test, and you have failed it.\"",
      "That reached her. Harry could see it. But she kept her shoulders\nstraight.",
      "Professor Quirrell's voice was sympathetic and seemed to fill\nthe whole room. \"Knowing things isn't always enough, Miss Granger.\nIf you cannot give and receive violence on the order of stubbing\nyour toe, then you cannot defend yourself and you will not pass\nDefence. Please rejoin your classmates.\"",
      "Hermione walked back towards the Ravenclaw cluster. Her face\nlooked peaceful and Harry, for some odd reason, wanted to start\nclapping. Even though Professor Quirrell had been\nright.",
      "\"So,\" Professor Quirrell said. \"It becomes clear that Hermione\nGranger is not the most dangerous student in the classroom. Who do\nyou think might actually be the most dangerous person here? -\nbesides me, of course.\"",
      "Without even thinking, Harry turned to look at the Slytherin\ncontingent.",
      "\"Draco, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy,\" said\nProfessor Quirrell. \"It seems that many of your fellow pupils are\nlooking in your direction. Come forth, if you would.\"",
      "Draco did so, walking with a certain pride in his bearing. He\nstepped onto the dais and looked up at Professor Quirrell with a\nsmile.",
      "\"Mr. Malfoy,\" Professor Quirrell said. \"Fire.\"",
      "Harry would have tried to stop it if there'd been time but in\none smooth motion Draco spun on the Ravenclaw contingent and raised\nhis wand and said \"Mahasu!\u202f\" like it was all one syllable\nand Hermione was saying \"Ow!\" and that was that.",
      "\"Well struck,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"Two Quirrell points to\nyou. But tell me, why did you target Miss Granger?\"",
      "There was a pause.",
      "Finally Draco said, \"Because she stood out the most.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell's lips turned up in a thin smile. \"And that\nis the true reason why Draco Malfoy is dangerous. Had he selected\nany other, that child would more likely resent being singled out,\nand Mr. Malfoy would more probably make an enemy. And while Mr.\nMalfoy might have given some other justification for selecting her,\nthat would have served him no purpose save to alienate some of you,\nwhile others are already cheering him whether he says anything or\nnot. Which is to say that Mr. Malfoy is dangerous because he knows\nwho to strike and who not to strike, how to make allies and avoid\nmaking enemies. Two more Quirrell points to you, Mr. Malfoy. And as\nyou have demonstrated an exemplary virtue of Slytherin, I think\nthat Salazar's House has earned a point as well. You may rejoin\nyour friends.\"",
      "Draco bowed slightly and walked back to the Slytherin\ncontingent. Some clapping started from the green-trimmed robes, but\nProfessor Quirrell made a cutting gesture and silence fell\nagain.",
      "\"It might seem that our game is done,\" said Professor Quirrell.\n\"And yet there is a single student in this classroom who is more\ndangerous than the scion of Malfoy.\"",
      "And now for some reason there seemed to be an awful lot\nof people looking at...",
      "\"Harry Potter. Come forth.\"",
      "This did not bode well.",
      "Harry reluctantly walked towards where Professor Quirrell stood\non his raised dais, still leaning slightly against his teacher's\ndesk.",
      "The nervousness of being put into the spotlight seemed to be\nsharpening Harry's wits as he approached the dais, and his mind was\nruffling through possibilities for what Professor Quirrell might\nthink could demonstrate Harry's dangerousness. Would he be asked to\ncast a spell? To defeat a Dark Lord?",
      "Demonstrate his supposed immunity to the Killing Curse? Surely\nProfessor Quirrell was too smart for that...",
      "Harry stopped well short of the dais, and Professor Quirrell\ndidn't ask him to come any closer.",
      "\"The irony is,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"you all looked at the\nright person for entirely the wrong reasons. You are thinking,\"\nProfessor Quirrell's lips twisted, \"that Harry Potter has defeated\nthe Dark Lord, and so must be very dangerous. Bah. He was one year\nold. Whatever quirk of fate killed the Dark Lord likely had little\nto do with Mr. Potter's abilities as a fighter. But after I heard\nrumors of one Ravenclaw facing down five older Slytherins, I\ninterviewed several eyewitnesses and came to the conclusion that\nHarry Potter would be my most dangerous student.\"",
      "A jolt of adrenaline poured into Harry's system, making him\nstand up straighter. He didn't know what conclusion Professor\nQuirrell had come to, but that couldn't be good.",
      "\"Ah, Professor Quirrell -\" Harry started to say.",
      "Professor Quirrell looked amused. \"You're thinking that I've\ncome up with a wrong answer, aren't you, Mr. Potter? You will learn\nto expect better of me.\" Professor Quirrell straightened\nfrom where he had leaned on the desk. \"Mr. Potter, all things have\ntheir accustomed uses. Give me ten unaccustomed uses of objects in\nthis room for combat!\"",
      "For a moment Harry was rendered speechless by the sheer, raw\nshock of having been understood.",
      "And then the ideas started to pour out.",
      "\"There are desks which are heavy enough to be fatal if dropped\nfrom a great height. There are chairs with metal legs that could\nimpale someone if driven hard enough. The air in this classroom\nwould be deadly by its absence, since people die in vacuum, and it\ncan serve as a carrier for poison gases.\"",
      "Harry had to stop briefly for breath, and into that pause\nProfessor Quirrell said:",
      "\"That's three. You need ten. The rest of the class thinks that\nyou've already used up the whole contents of the classroom.\"",
      "\"Ha! The floor can be removed to create a spike pit to\nfall into, the ceiling can be collapsed on someone, the walls can\nserve as raw material for Transfiguration into any number of deadly\nthings - knives, say.\"",
      "\"That's six. But surely you're scraping the bottom of the barrel\nnow?\"",
      "\"I haven't even started! Just look at all the people! Having a\nGryffindor attack the enemy is an ordinary use, of course\n-\"",
      "\"I will not count that one.\"",
      "\"- but their blood can also be used to drown someone. Ravenclaws\nare known for their brains, but their internal organs could be sold\non the black market for enough money to hire an assassin.\nSlytherins aren't just useful as assassins, they can also be thrown\nat sufficient velocity to crush an enemy. And Hufflepuffs, in\naddition to being hard workers, also contain bones that can be\nremoved, sharpened, and used to stab someone.\"",
      "By now the rest of the class was staring at Harry in some\nhorror. Even the Slytherins looked shocked.",
      "\"That's ten, though I'm being generous in counting the Ravenclaw\none. Now, for extra credit, one Quirrell point for each use of\nobjects in this room which you have not yet named.\" Professor\nQuirrell favored Harry with a companionable smile. \"The rest of\nyour class thinks you are in trouble now, since you've named\neverything except the targets and you have no idea what may be done\nwith those.\"",
      "\"Bah! I've named all the people, but not my robes, which can be\nused to suffocate an enemy if wrapped around their head enough\ntimes, or Hermione Granger's robes, which can be torn into strips\nand tied into a rope and used to hang someone, or Draco Malfoy's\nrobes, which can be used to start a fire -\"",
      "\"Three points,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"no more clothing\nnow.\"",
      "\"My wand can be pushed into an enemy's brain through their eye\nsocket\" and someone made a horrified, strangling sound.",

      "\"Five points, and enough.\"",
      "\"Hmph,\" Harry said. \"Ten Quirrell points to one House point,\nright? You should have let me keep going until I'd won the House\nCup, I haven't even started yet on the unaccustomed uses of\neverything I've got in my pockets\" or the mokeskin pouch itself and\nhe couldn't talk about the Time-Turner or the invisibility cloak\nbut there had to be something he could say about those red\nspheres...",
      "\"Enough, Mr. Potter. Well, do you all think you\nunderstand what makes Mr. Potter the most dangerous student in the\nclassroom?\"",
      "There was a low murmur of assent.",
      "\"Say it out loud, please. Terry Boot, what makes your dorm-mate\ndangerous?\"",
      "\"Ah... um... he's creative?\"",
      "\"Wrong!\u202f\" bellowed Professor Quirrell, and his fist\ncame down sharply on his desk with an amplified sound that made\neveryone jump. \"All of Mr. Potter's ideas were worse than\nuseless!\"",
      "Harry started in surprise.",
      "\"Remove the floor to create a spike trap? Ridiculous! In combat\nyou do not have that sort of preparation time and if you did there\nwould be a hundred better uses! Transfigure material from the\nwalls? Mr. Potter cannot perform Transfiguration! Mr. Potter had\nexactly one idea which he could use immediately, right now, without\nextensive preparation or a cooperative enemy or magic he does not\nknow. That idea was to jam his wand through his enemy's eye socket.\nWhich would be more likely to break his wand than kill his\nopponent! In short, Mr. Potter, I'm afraid that your proposals were\nuniformly awful.\"",
      "\"What?\" Harry said indignantly. \"You asked for unusual\nideas, not practical ones! I was thinking outside the box! How\nwould you use something in this classroom to kill\nsomeone?\"",
      "Professor Quirrell's expression was disapproving, but there were\nsmile crinkles around his eyes. \"Mr. Potter, I never said you were\nto kill. There is a time and a place for taking your enemy\nalive, and inside a Hogwarts classroom is usually one of those\nplaces. But to answer your question, hit them on the neck with the\nedge of a chair.\"",
      "There was some laughter from the Slytherins, but they were\nlaughing with Harry, not at him.",
      "Everyone else was looking rather horrified.",
      "\"But Mr. Potter has now demonstrated why he is the most\ndangerous student in the classroom. I asked for unaccustomed uses\nof items in this room for combat. Mr. Potter could have suggested\nusing a desk to block a curse, or using a chair to trip an oncoming\nenemy, or wrapping cloth around his arm to create an improvised\nshield. Instead, every single use that Mr. Potter named was\noffensive rather than defensive, and either fatal or potentially\nfatal.\"",
      "What? Wait, that couldn't be true... Harry had a sudden sense of\nvertigo as he tried to remember what exactly he'd suggested, surely\nthere had to be a counterexample...",
      "\"And that,\" Professor Quirrell said, \"is why Mr. Potter's ideas\nwere so strange and useless - because he had to reach far into the\nimpractical in order to meet his standard of killing the\nenemy. To him, any idea which fell short of that was not worth\nconsidering. This reflects a quality that we might call intent\nto kill. I have it. Harry Potter has it, which is how he could\nstare down five older Slytherins. Draco Malfoy does not have it,\nnot yet. Mr. Malfoy would hardly shrink from talk of ordinary\nmurder, but even he was shocked - yes you were Mr. Malfoy, I was\nwatching your face - when Mr. Potter described how to use his\nclassmates' bodies as raw material. There are censors inside your\nmind which make you flinch away from thoughts like that. Mr. Potter\nthinks purely of killing the enemy, he will grasp at any\nmeans to do so, he does not flinch, his censors are off. Even\nthough his youthful genius is so undisciplined and impractical as\nto be useless, his intent to kill makes Harry Potter the\nMost Dangerous Student in the Classroom. One final point to him -\nno, let us make that a point to Ravenclaw - for this indispensable\nrequisite of a true fighting wizard.\"",
      "Harry's mouth gaped open in speechless shock as he searched\nfrantically for something to say to this. That is so completely\nnot what I am about!",
      "But he could see that the other students were starting to\nbelieve it. Harry's mind was flipping through possible denials and\nnot finding anything that could stand up against the authoritative\nvoice of Professor Quirrell. The best Harry had come up with was\n\"I'm not a psychopath, I'm just very creative\" and that sounded\nkind of ominous. He needed to say something unexpected, something\nthat would make people stop and reconsider -",
      "\"And now,\" Professor Quirrell said. \"Mr. Potter. Fire.\"",
      "Nothing happened, of course.",
      "\"Ah, well,\" said Professor Quirrell. He sighed. \"I suppose we\nmust all start somewhere. Mr. Potter, select any student you please\nfor a Simple Strike Hex. You will do so before I dismiss\nyour class for the day. If you do not, I will begin deducting House\npoints, and I will keep on deducting them until you do.\"",
      "Harry carefully raised his wand. He had to do that much, or\nProfessor Quirrell might start deducting House points right\naway.",
      "Slowly, as though on a roasting platter, Harry turned to face\nthe Slytherins.",
      "And Harry's eyes met Draco's.",
      "Draco Malfoy didn't look the slightest bit afraid. The\nblonde-haired boy wasn't giving any visible sign of assent such as\nHarry had given Hermione, but then he could hardly be expected to\ndo so. The other Slytherins would think that rather odd.",
      "\"Why the hesitation?\" said Professor Quirrell. \"Surely there's\nonly one obvious choice.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry said. \"Only one obvious choice.\"",
      "Harry twisted the wand and said \"Ma-ha-su!\u202f\"",
      "There was complete silence in the classroom.",
      "Harry shook his left arm, trying to get rid of the lingering\nsting.",
      "There was more silence.",
      "Finally Professor Quirrell sighed. \"Yes, quite ingenious, but\nthere was a lesson to be taught and you dodged it. One point from\nRavenclaw for showing off your own cleverness at the expense of the\nactual goal. Class dismissed.\"",
      "And before anyone else could say anything, Harry sang out:",
      "\"Just kidding! RAVENCLAW!\"",
      "There was silence for a brief moment after that, a sound of\npeople thinking, and then the murmurs started and rapidly rose to a\nroar of conversation.",
      "Harry turned towards Professor Quirrell, the two of them needed\nto talk -",
      "Quirrell had slumped over and was trudging back to his\nchair.",
      "No. Not acceptable. They really needed to talk. Stuff\nthe zombie act, Professor Quirrell would probably wake up if Harry\npoked him a couple of times. Harry started forward -",
      "WRONG\nDON'T\nBAD IDEA",
      "Harry swayed and stopped in his tracks, feeling dizzy.",
      "And then a flock of Ravenclaws descended on him and the\ndiscussions began."

      "Historical note: In the Roman calendar, the \"Ides\" of a month\nreferred to the 15th day of March, May, July, and October, and to\nthe 13th day of all other months.",
      "\"You start to see the pattern, hear the rhythm of the\nworld.\"",
      "Thursday.",
      "If you wanted to be specific, 7:24am on Thursday morning.",
      "Harry was sitting on his bed, a textbook lying limp in his\nmotionless hands.",
      "Harry had just had an idea for a truly brilliant\nexperimental test.",
      "It would mean waiting an extra hour for breakfast, but that was\nwhy he had cereal bars. No, this idea absolutely positively had to\nbe tested right away, immediately, now.",
      "Harry set the textbook aside, leapt out of bed, raced around his\nbed, yanked out the cavern level of his trunk, ran down the stairs,\nand started moving boxes of books around. (He really needed to\nunpack and get bookcases at some point but he was in the middle of\nhis textbook reading contest with Hermione and falling behind so he\nhadn't had time.)",
      "Harry found the book he wanted and raced back upstairs.",
      "The other boys were getting ready to go down to breakfast in the\nGreat Hall and start the day.",
      "\"Excuse me can you do something for me?\" said Harry. He was\nflipping through the book's index as he spoke, found the page with\nthe first ten thousand primes, flipped to that page, and thrust the\nbook at Anthony Goldstein. \"Pick two three-digit numbers from this\nlist. Don't tell me what they are. Just multiply them together and\ntell me the product. Oh, and can you do the calculation twice to\ndouble-check? Please make really sure you've got the right answer,\nI'm not sure what's going to happen to me or the universe if you\nmake a multiplication error.\"",
      "It said a lot about what life in that dorm had been like over\nthe past few days that Anthony didn't even bother saying anything\nlike \"Why'd you suddenly flip out?\" or \"That seems really weird,\nwhat are your reasons for asking?\" or \"What do you mean, you're not\nsure what's going to happen to the universe?\"",
      "Anthony wordlessly accepted the book and took out a parchment\nand quill. Harry spun around and shut his eyes, making sure not to\nsee anything, dancing back and forth and bouncing up and down with\nimpatience. He got a pad of paper and a mechanical pencil and got\nready to write.",
      "\"Okay,\" Anthony said, \"One hundred and eighty-one thousand, four\nhundred and twenty-nine.\"",
      "Harry wrote down 181,429. He repeated what he'd just written\ndown, and Anthony confirmed it.",
      "Then Harry raced back down into the cavern level of his trunk,\nglanced at his watch (the watch said 4:28 which meant 7:28) and\nthen shut his eyes.",
      "Around thirty seconds later, Harry heard the sound of steps,\nfollowed by the sound of the cavern level of the trunk sliding\nshut. (Harry wasn't worried about suffocating. An automatic\nAir-Freshening Charm was part of what you got if you were willing\nto buy a really good trunk. Wasn't magic wonderful, it didn't have\nto worry about electric bills.)",
      "And when Harry opened his eyes, he saw just what he'd been\nhoping to see, a folded piece of paper left on the floor, the gift\nof his future self.",
      "Call that piece of paper \"Paper-2\".",
      "Harry tore a piece of paper off his pad.",
      "Call that \"Paper-1\". It was, of course, the same piece of paper.\nYou could even see, if you looked closely, that the ragged edges\nmatched.",
      "Harry reviewed in his mind the algorithm that he would\nfollow.",
      "If Harry opened up Paper-2 and it was blank, then he would write\n\"101 x 101\" down on Paper-1, fold it up, study for an hour, go back\nin time, drop off Paper-1 (which would thereby become Paper-2), and\nhead on up out of the cavern level to join his dorm mates for\nbreakfast.",
      "If Harry opened up Paper-2 and it had two numbers written on it,\nHarry would multiply those numbers together.",
      "If their product equaled 181,429, Harry would write down those\ntwo numbers on Paper-1 and send Paper-1 back in time.",
      "Otherwise Harry would add 2 to the number on the right and write\ndown the new pair of numbers on Paper-1. Unless that made the\nnumber on the right greater than 997, in which case Harry would add\n2 to the number on the left and write down 101 on the right.",
      "And if Paper-2 said 997 x 997, Harry would leave Paper-1\nblank.",
      "Which meant that the only possible stable time loop was\nthe one in which Paper-2 contained the two prime factors of\n181,429.",
      "If this worked, Harry could use it to recover any sort of answer\nthat was easy to check but hard to find. He wouldn't have\njust shown that P=NP once you had a Time-Turner, this\ntrick was more general than that. Harry could use it to\nfind the combinations on combination locks, or passwords of every\nsort. Maybe even find the entrance to Slytherin's Chamber of\nSecrets, if Harry could figure out some systematic way of\ndescribing all the locations in Hogwarts. It would be an awesome\ncheat even by Harry's standards of cheating.",
      "Harry took Paper-2 in his trembling hand, and unfolded it.",
      "Paper-2 said in slightly shaky handwriting:",
      "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME",
      "Harry wrote down \"DO NOT MESS WITH TIME\" on Paper-1 in slightly\nshaky handwriting, folded it neatly, and resolved not to do any\nmore truly brilliant experiments on Time until he was at least\nfifteen years old.",
      "To the best of Harry's knowledge, that had been the scariest\nexperimental result in the entire history of science.",
      "It had been somewhat difficult for Harry to focus on reading his\ntextbook for the next hour.",
      "That was how Harry's Thursday started.",
      "Thursday.",
      "If you wanted to be specific, 3:32pm on Thursday afternoon.",
      "Harry and all the other boys in the first year were outside on a\ngrassy field with Madam Hooch, standing next to the Hogwarts supply\nof broomsticks. The girls would be learning to fly separately.\nApparently, for some reason, girls didn't want to learn how to fly\non broomsticks in the presence of boys.",
      "Harry had been a little wobbly all day long. He just couldn't\nseem to stop wondering how that particular stable time\nloop had been selected out of what was, in retrospect, a rather\nlarge space of possibilities.",
      "Also: seriously, broomsticks? He was going to fly on,\nbasically, a line segment? Wasn't that pretty much the single most\nunstable shape you could possibly find, short of attempting to hold\non to a point marble? Who'd selected that design for a\nflying device, out of all the possibilities? Harry had been hoping\nthat it was just a figure of speech, but no, they were standing in\nfront of what looked for all the world like ordinary wooden kitchen\nbroomsticks. Had someone just gotten stuck on the idea of\nbroomsticks and failed to consider anything else? It had to be.\nThere was no way that the optimal designs for cleaning\nkitchens and flying would happen to coincide if you worked them out\nfrom scratch.",
      "It was a clear day with a bright blue sky and a brilliant sun\nthat was just begging to get in your eyes and make it impossible to\nsee, if you were trying to fly around the sky. The ground was nice\nand dry, smelling positively baked, and somehow felt very, very\nhard under Harry's shoes.",
      "Harry kept reminding himself that the lowest common denominator\nof eleven-year-olds was expected to learn this and it couldn't be\nthat hard.",
      "\"Stick out your right hand over the broom, or left hand if\nyou're left-handed,\" called Madam Hooch. \"And say, UP!\"",
      "\"UP!\" everyone shouted.",
      "The broomstick leapt eagerly into Harry's hand.",
      "Which put him at the head of the class, for once. Apparently\nsaying \"UP!\" was a lot more difficult than it looked, and most of\nthe broomsticks were rolling around on the ground or trying to inch\naway from their would-be riders.",
      "(Of course Harry would have bet money that Hermione had done at\nleast as well when it came her own turn to try, earlier in the day.\nThere couldn't possibly be anything he could master on the\nfirst try which would baffle Hermione, and if there was\nand it turned out to be broomstick riding instead of\nanything intellectual, Harry would just die.)",
      "It took a while for everyone to get a broomstick in front of\nthem. Madam Hooch showed them how to mount and then walked around\nthe field, correcting grips and stances. Apparently even among the\nfew children who'd been allowed to fly at home, they hadn't been\ntaught to do it correctly.",
      "Madam Hooch surveyed the field of boys, and nodded. \"Now, when I\nblow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard.\"",
      "Harry swallowed hard, trying to quell the queasy feeling in his\nstomach.",
      "\"Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come\nstraight back down by leaning forwards slightly. On my whistle -\nthree - two -\"",
      "One of the brooms shot skyward, accompanied by a young boy's\nscreams - of horror, not delight. The boy was spinning at an awful\nrate as he ascended, they only got glimpses of his white face -",
      "As though in slow motion, Harry was leaping back off his own\nbroomstick and scrabbling for his wand, though he didn't really\nknow what he planned to do with it, he'd had exactly two sessions\nof Charms and the last one had been the Hover Charm but\nHarry had only been able to cast the spell successfully one time\nout of three and he certainly couldn't levitate whole people -",
      "If there is any hidden power in me, let it reveal itself\nNOW!",
      "\"Come back, boy!\" shouted Madam Hooch (which had to be the most\nunhelpful instruction imaginable for dealing with an out-of-control\nbroomstick, from a flying instructor, and a fully\nautomatic section of Harry's brain added Madam Hooch to his tally\nof fools).",
      "And the boy was thrown off the broomstick.",
      "He seemed to move very slowly through the air, at first.",
      "\"Wingardium Leviosa!\u202f\" screamed Harry.",
      "The spell failed. He could feel it fail.",
      "There was a THUD and a distant cracking sound, and the boy lay\nfacedown on the grass in a heap.",
      "Harry sheathed his wand and raced forwards at full speed. He\narrived at the boy's side at the same time as Madam Hooch, and\nHarry reached into his pouch and tried to recall oh god what was\nthe name never mind he'd just try \"Healer's Pack!\" and it popped up\ninto his hand and -",
      "\"Broken wrist,\" Madam Hooch said. \"Calm down, boy, he just has a\nbroken wrist!\"",
      "There was a sort of mental lurch as Harry's mind snapped out of\nPanic Mode.",
      "The Emergency Healing Pack Plus lay open in front of him, and\nthere was a syringe of liquid fire in Harry's hand, which would\nhave kept the boy's brain oxygenated if he'd managed to snap his\nneck.",
      "\"Ah...\" Harry said in a rather wavering sort of voice. His heart\nwas pounding so loudly that he almost couldn't hear himself panting\nfor breath. \"Broken bone... right... Setting String?\"",
      "\"That's for emergencies only,\" snapped Madam Hooch. \"Put it\naway, he's fine.\" She leaned over the boy, offering him a hand.\n\"Come on, boy, it's all right, up you get!\"",
      "\"You're not seriously going to make him ride the broomstick\nagain?\" Harry said in horror.",
      "Madam Hooch sent Harry a glare. \"Of course not!\" She pulled the\nboy to his feet using his good arm - Harry saw with a shock that it\nwas Neville Longbottom again, what was with him?\n- and she turned to all the watching children. \"None of you is to\nmove while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those\nbrooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you can\nsay 'Quidditch.' Come on, dear.\"",
      "And Madam Hooch walked off with Neville, who was clutching his\nwrist and trying to control his sniffles.",
      "When they were out of earshot, one of the Slytherins started\ngiggling.",
      "That set off the others.",
      "Harry turned and looked at them. It seemed like a good time to\nmemorise some faces.",
      "And Harry saw that Draco was strolling towards him, accompanied\nby Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle. Mr. Crabbe wasn't smiling. Mr. Goyle\ndecidedly was. Draco himself was wearing a very controlled face\nthat twitched occasionally, from which Harry inferred that Draco\nthought it was hilarious but saw no political advantage to be\ngained by laughing about it now instead of in the Slytherin\ndungeons afterwards.",
      "\"Well, Potter,\" Draco said in a low voice that didn't carry,\nstill with that very controlled face that was twitching\noccasionally, \"Just wanted to say, when you take advantage of\nemergencies to demonstrate leadership, you want to look like you're\nin total control of the situation, rather than, say, going into a\ncomplete panic.\" Mr. Goyle giggled, and Draco shot him a quelling\nlook. \"But you probably scored a few points anyway. You need any\nhelp stowing that healer's kit?\"",
      "Harry turned to look at the Healing Pack, which got his own face\nturned away from Draco. \"I think I'm fine,\" Harry said. He put the\nsyringe back in its place, redid the latches, and stood up.",
      "Ernie Macmillan arrived just as Harry was feeding the pack back\ninto his mokeskin pouch.",
      "\"Thank you, Harry Potter, on behalf of Hufflepuff,\" Ernie\nMacmillan said formally. \"It was a good try and a good\nthought.\"",
      "\"A good thought indeed,\" drawled Draco. \"Why didn't anyone in\nHufflepuff have their wands out? Maybe if you'd all helped\ninstead of just Potter, you could've caught him. I thought\nHufflepuffs were supposed to stick together?\"",
      "Ernie looked like he was torn between getting angry and wanting\nto die of shame. \"We didn't think of it in time -\"",
      "\"Ah,\" said Draco, \"didn't think of it, I guess that's\nwhy it's better to have one Ravenclaw as a friend than all of\nHufflepuff.\"",
      "Oh, hell, how was Harry supposed to juggle this one... \"You're\nnot helping,\" Harry said in a mild tone. Hoping Draco would\ninterpret that as you're interfering with my plans, please shut\nup.",
      "\"Hey, what's this?\" said Mr. Goyle. He stooped to the grass and\npicked up something around the size of a large marble, a glass ball\nthat seemed to be filled with a swirling white mist.",
      "Ernie blinked. \"Neville's Remembrall!\"",
      "\"What's a Remembrall?\" asked Harry.",
      "\"It turns red if you've forgotten something,\" Ernie said. \"It\ndoesn't tell you what you forgot, though. Give it here, please, and\nI'll hand it back to Neville later.\" Ernie held out his hand.",
      "A sudden grin flashed across Mr. Goyle's face and he spun around\nand raced away.",
      "Ernie stood still for a moment in surprise, and then shouted\n\"Hey!\" and ran after Mr. Goyle.",
      "And Mr. Goyle grabbed a broomstick, hopped on with one smooth\nmotion and took to the air.",
      "Harry's jaw dropped. Hadn't Madam Hooch said that would get him\nexpelled?",
      "\"That idiot!\u202f\" Draco hissed. He opened his mouth to\nshout -",
      "\"Hey!\u202f\" shouted Ernie. \"That's Neville's! Give it\nback!\u202f\"",
      "The Slytherins started cheering and hooting.",
      "Draco's mouth snapped shut. Harry caught the sudden look of\nindecision on his face.",
      "\"Draco,\" Harry said in a low tone, \"if you don't order that\nidiot back on the ground, the teacher's going to get back and\n-\"",
      "\"Come and get it, Hufflepuffle!\u202f\" shouted Mr. Goyle,\nand a great cheer went up from the Slytherins.",
      "\"I can't!\u202f\" whispered Draco. \"Everyone in Slytherin\nwould think I'm weak!\u202f\"",
      "\"And if Mr. Goyle gets expelled,\" hissed Harry, \"your\nfather is going to think you're a moron!\u202f\"",
      "Draco's face twisted in agony.",
      "At that moment -",
      "\"Hey, Slytherslime,\" shouted Ernie, \"didn't anyone ever\ntell you that Hufflepuffs stick together? Wands out,\nHufflepuff!\u202f\"",
      "And there were suddenly a whole lot of wands pointed in Mr.\nGoyle's direction.",
      "Three seconds later -",
      "\"Wands out, Slytherin!\u202f\" said around five different\nSlytherins.",
      "And there were a whole lot of wands pointed in Hufflepuff's\ndirection.",
      "Two seconds later -",
      "\"Wands out, Gryffindor!\u202f\"",
      "\"Do something, Potter!\u202f\" whispered Draco. \"I can't\nbe the one to stop this it has to be you! I'll owe you a favour\njust think of something aren't you supposed to be\nbrilliant?\u202f\"",
      "In around five and a half seconds, realised Harry, someone was\ngoing to cast the Sumerian Simple Strike Hex and by the time it was\nover and the teachers were done expelling people the only boys left\nin his year would be Ravenclaws.",
      "\"Wands out, Ravenclaw!\u202f\" shouted Michael Corner who was\napparently feeling left out of the disaster.",
      "\"GREGORY GOYLE!\" screamed Harry. \"I challenge you\nto a contest for possession of Neville's Remembrall!\"",
      "There was a sudden pause.",
      "\"Oh, really?\" said Draco in the loudest drawl Harry had ever\nheard. \"That sounds interesting. What sort of contest, Potter?\"",
      "Er...",
      "\"Contest\" had been as far as Harry's inspiration had gotten.\nWhat sort of contest, he couldn't say \"chess\" because Draco\nwouldn't be able to accept without it looking strange, he couldn't\nsay \"arm-wrestling\" because Mr. Goyle would crush him -",
      "\"How about this?\" Harry said loudly. \"Gregory Goyle and I stand\napart from each other, and no one else is allowed to come near\neither of us. We don't use our wands and neither does anyone else.\nI don't move from where I'm standing, and neither does he. And if I\ncan get my hands on Neville's Remembrall, then Gregory Goyle\nrelinquishes all claim to that Remembrall he's holding and gives it\nto me.\"",
      "There was another pause as people's looks of relief transmuted\nto confusion.",
      "\"Hah, Potter!\" said Draco loudly. \"I'd like to see you do\nthat! Mr. Goyle accepts!\"",
      "\"It's on!\" said Harry.",
      "\"Potter, what?\u202f\" whispered Draco, which he somehow did\nwithout moving his lips.",
      "Harry didn't know how to answer without moving his.",
      "People were putting their wands away, and Mr. Goyle swooped\ngracefully to the ground, looking rather confused. Some Hufflepuffs\nstarted over towards Mr. Goyle, but Harry shot them a desperately\npleading look and they backed off.",
      "Harry walked toward Mr. Goyle and stopped when he was a few\npaces away, far enough apart that they couldn't reach each\nother.",
      "Slowly, deliberately, Harry sheathed his wand.",
      "Everyone else backed away.",
      "Harry swallowed. He knew in broad outline what he\nwanted to do, but it had to be done in such a way that no\none understood what he'd done -",
      "\"All right,\" Harry said loudly. \"And now...\" He took a deep\nbreath and raised one hand, fingers ready to snap. There were gasps\nfrom anyone who'd heard about the pies, which was practically\neveryone. \"I call upon the insanity of Hogwarts! Happy happy\nboom boom swamp swamp swamp!\u202f\" And Harry snapped his\nfingers.",
      "A lot of people flinched.",
      "And nothing happened.",
      "Harry let the silence stretch on for a while, developing,\nuntil...",
      "\"Um,\" someone said. \"Is that it?\"",
      "Harry looked at the boy who'd spoken. \"Look in front of you. You\nsee that patch of ground that looks barren, without any grass on\nit?\"",
      "\"Um, yeah,\" said the boy, a Gryffindor (Dean something?).",
      "\"Dig it up.\"",
      "Now Harry was getting a lot of strange looks.",
      "\"Er, why?\" said Dean something.",
      "\"Just do it,\" said Terry Boot in a weary voice. \"No point asking\nwhy, trust me on this one.\"",
      "Dean something kneeled down and began to scoop away dirt.",
      "After a minute or so, Dean stood up again. \"There's nothing\nthere,\" Dean said.",
      "Huh. Harry had been planning to go back in time and bury a\ntreasure map that would lead to another treasure map that would\nlead to Neville's Remembrall which he would put there after getting\nit back from Mr. Goyle...",
      "Then Harry realised there was a much simpler way which didn't\nthreaten the secret of Time-Turners quite as much.",
      "\"Thanks, Dean!\" Harry said loudly. \"Ernie, would you look around\non the ground where Neville fell and see if you can find Neville's\nRemembrall?\"",
      "People looked even more confused.",
      "\"Just do it,\" said Terry Boot. \"He'll keep trying until\nsomething works, and the scary thing is that -\"",
      "\"Merlin!\u202f\" gasped Ernie. He was holding up Neville's\nRemembrall. \"It's here! Right where he fell!\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" cried Mr. Goyle. He looked down and saw...",
      "...that he was still holding Neville's Remembrall.",
      "There was a rather long pause.",
      "\"Er,\" said Dean something, \"that's not possible, is it?\"",
      "\"It's a plot hole,\" said Harry. \"I made myself weird enough to\ndistract the universe for a moment and it forgot that Goyle had\nalready picked up the Remembrall.\"",
      "\"No, wait, I mean, that's totally not possible -\"",
      "\"Excuse me, are we all standing around here waiting to go flying\non broomsticks? Yes we are. So shut up. Anyway, once I get my hands\non Neville's Remembrall, the contest is over and Gregory Goyle has\nto relinquish all claim to the Remembrall he's holding and give it\nto me. Those were the terms, remember?\" Harry stretched out a hand\nand beckoned Ernie. \"Just roll it over here, since no one's\nsupposed to get close to me, okay?\"",
      "\"Hold on!\" shouted a Slytherin - Blaise Zabini, Harry wasn't\nlikely to forget that name. \"How do we know that's Neville's\nRemembrall? You could've just dropped another Remembrall\nthere -\"",
      "\"The Slytherin is strong with this one,\" Harry said, smiling.\n\"But you have my word that the one Ernie's holding is Neville's. No\ncomment about the one Gregory Goyle's holding.\"",
      "Zabini spun to Draco. \"Malfoy! You're not just going to\nlet him get away with that -\"",
      "\"Shut up, you,\" rumbled Mr. Crabbe, standing behind Draco. \"Mr.\nMalfoy doesn't need you to tell him what to do!\"",
      "Good minion.",
      "\"My bet was with Draco, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of\nMalfoy,\" Harry said. \"Not with you, Zabini. I have done what Mr.\nMalfoy said he'd like to see me do, and as for the judgment of the\nbet, I leave that up to Mr. Malfoy.\" Harry inclined his head\ntowards Draco and raised his eyebrows slightly. That ought to allow\nDraco to save enough face.",
      "There was a pause.",
      "\"You promise that actually is Neville's Remembrall?\"\nDraco said.",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry said. \"That's the one that'll go back to Neville\nand it was his originally. And the one Gregory Goyle's holding goes\nto me.\"",
      "Draco nodded, looking decisive. \"I won't question the word of\nthe Noble House of Potter, then, no matter how strange that all\nwas. And the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy keeps its word\nas well. Mr. Goyle, give that to Mr. Potter -\"",
      "\"Hey!\" Zabini said. \"He hasn't won yet, he hasn't got\nhis hands on -\"",
      "\"Catch, Harry!\" said Ernie, and he tossed the Remembrall.",
      "Harry easily snapped the Remembrall out of the air, he'd always\nhad good reflexes that way. \"There,\" said Harry, \"I win...\"",
      "Harry trailed off. All conversation stopped.",
      "The Remembrall was glowing bright red in his hand, blazing like\na miniature sun that cast shadows on the ground in broad\ndaylight.",
      "Thursday.",
      "If you wanted to be specific, 5:09pm on Thursday afternoon, in\nProfessor McGonagall's office, after flying classes. (With an extra\nhour for Harry slipped in between.)",
      "Professor McGonagall sitting on her stool. Harry in the hot seat\nin front of her desk.",
      "\"Professor,\" Harry said tightly, \"Slytherin was pointing their\nwands at Hufflepuff, Gryffindor was pointing their wands at\nSlytherin, some idiot called wands out in Ravenclaw, and I\nhad maybe five seconds to keep the whole thing from blowing\nsky-high! It was all I could think of!\"",
      "Professor McGonagall's face was pinched and angry. \"You are\nnot to use the Time-Turner in that fashion, Mr. Potter! Is the\nconcept of secrecy not something that you understand?\"",
      "\"They don't know how I did it! They just think I can do\nreally weird things by snapping my fingers! I've done other weird\nstuff that can't be done with Time-Turners even, and I'll do\nmore stuff like that, and this case won't even\nstand out! I had to do it, Professor!\"",
      "\"You did not have to do it!\" snapped Professor\nMcGonagall. \"All you needed to do was get this anonymous\nSlytherin back on the ground and the wands put away! You could\nhave challenged him to a game of Exploding Snap but no, you had to\nuse the Time-Turner in a flagrant and unnecessary manner!\"",
      "\"It was all I could think of! I don't even know what Exploding\nSnap is, they wouldn't have accepted a game of chess and\nif I'd picked arm-wresting I would have lost!\"",
      "\"Then you should have picked wrestling!\u202f\"",
      "Harry blinked. \"But then I'd have lost -\"",
      "Harry stopped.",
      "Professor McGonagall was looking very angry.",
      "\"I'm sorry, Professor McGonagall,\" Harry said in a small voice.\n\"I honestly didn't think of that, and you're right, I should have,\nit would have been brilliant if I had, but I just didn't think of\nthat at all...\"",
      "Harry's voice trailed off. It was suddenly apparent to him that\nhe'd had a lot of other options. He could have asked\nDraco to suggest something, he could have asked the\ncrowd... his use of the Time-Turner had been flagrant and\nunnecessary. There had been a giant space of possibilities, why had\nhe picked that one?",
      "Because he'd seen a way to win. Win possession of an\nunimportant trinket that the teachers would've taken back from Mr.\nGoyle anyway.",
      "Intent to win. That was what had gotten him.",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" Harry said again. \"For my pride and my\nstupidity.\"",
      "Professor McGonagall wiped a hand across her forehead. Some of\nher anger seemed to dissipate. But her voice still came out very\nhard. \"One more display like that, Mr. Potter, and you will be\nreturning that Time-Turner. Do I make myself very clear?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry said. \"I understand and I'm sorry.\"",
      "\"Then, Mr. Potter, you will be allowed to retain the Time-Turner\nfor now. And considering the size of the debacle you did, in fact,\navert, I will not deduct any points from Ravenclaw.\"",
      "Plus you couldn't explain why you'd deducted the\npoints. But Harry wasn't dumb enough to say that out loud.",
      "\"More importantly, why did the Remembrall go off like that?\"\nHarry said. \"Does it mean I've been Obliviated?\"",
      "\"That puzzles me as well,\" Professor McGonagall said slowly. \"If\nit were that simple, I would think that the courts would use\nRemembralls, and they do not. I shall look into it, Mr. Potter.\"\nShe sighed. \"You can go now.\"",
      "Harry started to get up from his chair, then halted. \"Um, sorry,\nI did have something else I wanted to tell you -\"",
      "You could hardly see the flinch. \"What is it, Mr. Potter?\"",
      "\"It's about Professor Quirrell -\"",
      "\"I'm sure, Mr. Potter, that it is nothing of importance.\"\nProfessor McGonagall spoke the words in a great rush. \"Surely you\nheard the Headmaster tell the students that you were not to bother\nus with any unimportant complaints about the Defence\nProfessor?\"",
      "Harry was rather confused. \"But this could be\nimportant, yesterday I got this sudden sense of doom when -\"",
      "\"Mr. Potter! I have a sense of doom as well! And my sense of\ndoom is suggesting that you must not finish that\nsentence!\u202f\"",
      "Harry's mouth gaped open. Professor McGonagall had succeeded;\nHarry was speechless.",
      "\"Mr. Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall, \"if you have discovered\nanything that seems interesting about Professor Quirrell, please\nfeel free not to share it with me or anyone else. Now I think\nyou've taken up enough of my valuable time -\"",
      "\"This isn't like you!\u202f\" Harry burst out. \"I'm sorry but\nthat just seems unbelievably irresponsible! From what I've\nheard there's some kind of jinx on the Defence position, and if you\nalready know something's going to go wrong, I'd think\nyou'd all be on your toes -\"",
      "\"Go wrong, Mr. Potter? I certainly hope not.\"\nProfessor McGonagall's face was expressionless. \"After Professor\nBlake was caught in a closet with no fewer than three fifth-year\nSlytherins last February, and a year before that, Professor Summers\nfailed so completely as an educator that her students thought a\nboggart was a kind of furniture, it would be catastrophic\nif some problem with the extraordinarily competent Professor\nQuirrell came to my attention now, and I daresay most of our\nstudents would fail their Defence O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s.\"",
      "\"I see,\" Harry said slowly, taking it all in. \"So in other\nwords, whatever's wrong with Professor Quirrell, you desperately\ndon't want to know about it until the end of the school year. And\nsince it's currently September, he could assassinate the Prime\nMinister on live television and get away with it so far as you're\nconcerned.\"",
      "Professor McGonagall gazed at him unblinkingly. \"I am certain\nthat I could never be heard endorsing such a statement, Mr. Potter.\nAt Hogwarts we strive to be proactive with respect to\nanything that threatens the educational attainment of our\nstudents.\"",
      "Such as first-year Ravenclaws who can't keep their mouths\nshut. \"I believe I understand you completely, Professor\nMcGonagall.\"",
      "\"Oh, I doubt that, Mr. Potter. I doubt that very much.\"\nProfessor McGonagall leaned forward, her face tightening again.\n\"Since you and I have already discussed matters far more sensitive\nthan these, I shall speak frankly. You, and you alone, have\nreported this mysterious sense of doom. You, and you alone, are a\nchaos magnet the likes of which I have never seen. After our little\nshopping trip to Diagon Alley, and then the Sorting Hat,\nand then today's little episode, I can well foresee that I\nam fated to sit in the Headmaster's office and hear some hilarious\ntale about Professor Quirrell in which you and you alone play a\nstarring role, after which there will be no choice but to fire him.\nI am already resigned to it, Mr. Potter. And if this sad event\ntakes place any earlier than the Ides of May, I will string you up\nby the gates of Hogwarts with your own intestines and pour fire\nbeetles into your nose. Now do you understand me\ncompletely?\"",
      "Harry nodded, his eyes very wide. Then, after a second, \"What do\nI get if I can make it happen on the last day of the school\nyear?\"",
      "\"Get out of my office!\u202f\"",
      "Thursday.",
      "There must have been something about Thursdays in Hogwarts.",
      "It was 5:32pm on Thursday afternoon, and Harry was standing next\nto Professor Flitwick, in front of the great stone gargoyle that\nguarded the entrance to the Headmaster's office.",
      "No sooner had he made it back from Professor McGonagall's office\nto the Ravenclaw study rooms than one of the students told him to\nreport to Professor Flitwick's office, and there Harry had learned\nthat Dumbledore wanted to speak to him.",
      "Harry, feeling rather apprehensive, had asked Professor Flitwick\nif the Headmaster had said what this was about.",
      "Professor Flitwick had shrugged in a helpless sort of way.",
      "Apparently Dumbledore had said that Harry was far too young to\ninvoke the words of power and madness.",
      "Happy happy boom boom swamp swamp swamp? Harry had\nthought but not said aloud.",
      "\"Please don't worry too much, Mr. Potter,\" squeaked Professor\nFlitwick from somewhere around Harry's shoulder level. (Harry was\ngrateful for Professor Flitwick's gigantic puffy beard, it was hard\ngetting used to a Professor who was not only shorter than him but\nspoke in a higher-pitched voice.) \"Headmaster Dumbledore may seem a\nlittle odd, or a lot odd, or even extremely odd, but he has never\nhurt a student in the slightest, and I don't believe he ever will.\"\nProfessor Flitwick gave Harry an encouraging smile. \"Just keep that\nin mind at all times and you'll be sure not to panic!\"",
      "This was not helping.",
      "\"Good luck!\" squeaked Professor Flitwick, and leaned over to the\ngargoyle and said something that Harry somehow failed to hear at\nall. (Of course, the password wouldn't be much good if you could\nhear someone saying it.) And the stone gargoyle walked aside with a\nvery natural and ordinary movement that Harry found rather\nshocking, since the gargoyle still looked like solid, immovable\nstone the whole time.",
      "Behind the gargoyle was a set of slowly revolving spiral stairs.\nThere was something disturbingly hypnotic about it, and even more\ndisturbing was that revolving the spiral ought not to take\nyou anywhere.",
      "\"Up you go!\" squeaked Flitwick.",
      "Harry rather nervously stepped onto the spiral, and found\nhimself, for some reason that his brain couldn't seem to visualise\nat all, moving upwards.",
      "The gargoyle thudded back into place behind him, and the spiral\nstairs kept turning and Harry kept being higher up, and after a\nrather dizzying time, Harry found himself in front of an oak door\nwith a brass griffin knocker.",
      "Harry reached out and turned the doorknob.",
      "The door swung open.",
      "And Harry saw the most interesting room he'd ever seen in his\nlife.",
      "There were tiny metal mechanisms that whirred or ticked or\nslowly changed shape or emitted little puffs of smoke. There were\ndozens of mysterious fluids in dozens of oddly shaped containers,\nall bubbling, boiling, oozing, changing color, or forming into\ninteresting shapes that vanished half a second after you saw them.\nThere were things that looked like clocks with many hands,\ninscribed with numbers or in unrecognisable languages. There was a\nbracelet bearing a lenticular crystal that sparkled with a thousand\ncolors, and a bird perched atop a golden platform, and a wooden cup\nfilled with what looked like blood, and a statue of a falcon\nencrusted in black enamel. The wall was all hung with pictures of\npeople sleeping, and the Sorting Hat was casually poised on a\nhatrack that was also holding two umbrellas and three red slippers\nfor left feet.",
      "In the midst of all the chaos was a clean black oaken desk.\nBefore the desk was an oaken stool. And behind the desk was a\nwell-cushioned throne containing Albus Percival Wulfric Brian\nDumbledore, who was adorned with a long silver beard, a hat like a\nsquashed giant mushroom, and what looked to Muggle eyes like three\nlayers of bright pink pyjamas.",
      "Dumbledore was smiling, and his bright eyes twinkled with a mad\nintensity.",
      "With some trepidation, Harry seated himself in front of the\ndesk. The door swung shut behind him with a loud\nthunk.",
      "\"Hello, Harry,\" said Dumbledore.",
      "\"Hello, Headmaster,\" Harry replied. So they were on a first-name\nbasis? Would Dumbledore now say to call him -",
      "\"Please, Harry!\" said Dumbledore. \"Headmaster sounds so formal.\nJust call me Heh for short.\"",
      "\"I'll be sure to, Heh,\" said Harry.",
      "There was a slight pause.",
      "\"Do you know,\" said Dumbledore, \"you're the first person who's\never taken me up on that?\"",
      "\"Ah...\" Harry said. He tried to control his voice despite the\nsudden sinking feeling in his stomach. \"I'm sorry, I, ah,\nHeadmaster, you told me to do it so I did -\"",
      "\"Heh, please!\" said Dumbledore cheerfully. \"And there's no call\nto be so worried, I won't launch you out a window just because you\nmake one mistake. I'll give you plenty of warnings first, if you're\ndoing something wrong! Besides, what matters isn't how people talk\nto you, it's what they think of you.\"",
      "He's never hurt a student, just keep remembering that and\nyou'll be sure not to panic.",
      "Dumbledore drew forth a small metal case and flipped it open,\nshowing some small yellow lumps. \"Sherbet lemon?\" said the\nHeadmaster.",
      "\"Er, no thank you, Heh,\" said Harry. Does slipping a student\nLSD count as hurting them, or does that fall into the category of\nharmless fun? \"You, um, said something about my being too\nyoung to invoke the words of power and madness?\"",
      "\"That you most certainly are!\" Dumbledore said. \"Thankfully the\nWords of Power and Madness were lost seven centuries ago and no one\nhas the slightest idea what they are anymore. It was just a little\nremark.\"",
      "\"Ah...\" Harry said. He was aware that his mouth was hanging\nopen. \"Why did you call me here, then?\"",
      "\"Why?\u202f\" Dumbledore repeated. \"Ah, Harry, if I went\naround all day asking why I do things, I'd never have time\nto get a single thing done! I'm quite a busy person, you know.\"",
      "Harry nodded, smiling. \"Yes, it was a very impressive list.\nHeadmaster of Hogwarts, Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, and\nSupreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards.\nSorry to ask but I was wondering, is it possible to get more than\nsix hours if you use more than one Time-Turner? Because it's pretty\nimpressive if you're doing all that on just thirty hours a\nday.\"",
      "There was another slight pause, during which Harry went on\nsmiling. He was a little apprehensive, actually a lot apprehensive,\nbut once it had become clear that Dumbledore was deliberately\nmessing with him, something within him absolutely refused\nto sit and take it like a defenceless lump.",
      "\"I'm afraid Time doesn't like being stretched out too much,\"\nsaid Dumbledore after the slight pause, \"and yet we ourselves seem\nto be a little too large for it, and so it's a constant struggle to\nfit our lives into Time.\"",
      "\"Indeed,\" Harry said with grave solemnity. \"That's why it's best\nto come to our points quickly.\"",
      "For a moment Harry wondered if he'd gone too far.",
      "Then Dumbledore chuckled. \"Straight to the point it shall be.\"\nThe Headmaster leaned forwards, tilting his squashed mushroom hat\nand brushing his beard against his desk. \"Harry, this Monday you\ndid something that should have been impossible even with a\nTime-Turner. Or rather, impossible with only a\nTime-Turner. Where did those two pies come from, I wonder?\"",
      "A jolt of adrenaline shot through Harry. He'd done that using\nthe Cloak of Invisibility, the one that had been given him in a\nChristmas box along with a note, and that note had said: If\nDumbledore saw a chance to possess one of the Deathly Hallows he\nwould never let it escape his grasp....",
      "\"A natural thought,\" Dumbledore went on, \"is that since none of\nthe first-years present were able to cast such a spell, someone\nelse was present, and yet unseen. And if no one could see them,\nwhy, it would be easy enough for them to throw the pies. One might\nfurther suspect that since you had a Time-Turner, you were the\ninvisible one; and that since the spell of Disillusionment is far\nbeyond your current abilities, you had an invisibility cloak.\"\nDumbledore smiled conspiratorially. \"Am I on the right track so\nfar, Harry?\"",
      "Harry was frozen. He had the feeling that an outright lie would\nnot at all be wise, and possibly not the least bit helpful, and he\ncouldn't think of anything else to say.",
      "Dumbledore waved a friendly hand. \"Don't worry, Harry, you\nhaven't done anything wrong. Invisibility cloaks aren't against the\nrules - I suppose they're rare enough that no one ever got around\nto putting them on the list. But really I was wondering something\nelse entirely.\"",
      "\"Oh?\" Harry said in the most normal voice he could manage.",
      "Dumbledore's eyes shone with enthusiasm. \"You see, Harry, after\nyou've been through a few adventures you tend to catch the hang of\nthese things. You start to see the pattern, hear the rhythm of the\nworld. You begin to harbour suspicions before the moment\nof revelation. You are the Boy-Who-Lived, and somehow an\ninvisibility cloak made its way into your hands only four days\nafter you discovered our magical Britain. Such cloaks are not for\nsale in Diagon Alley, but there is one which might find\nits own way to a destined wearer. And so I cannot help but wonder\nif by some strange chance you have found not just an\ninvisibility cloak, but the Cloak of Invisibility, one of\nthe three Deathly Hallows and reputed to hide the wearer from the\ngaze of Death himself.\" Dumbledore's gaze was bright and eager.\n\"May I see it, Harry?\"",
      "Harry swallowed. There was a full flood of adrenaline in his\nsystem now and it was entirely useless, this was the most powerful\nwizard in the world and there was no way he could make it out the\ndoor and there was nowhere in Hogwarts for him to hide if he did,\nhe was about to lose the Cloak that had been passed down through\nthe Potters for who knew how long -",
      "Slowly Dumbledore leaned back into his high chair. The bright\nlight had gone out of his eyes, and he looked puzzled and a little\nsorrowful. \"Harry,\" said Dumbledore, \"if you don't want to, you can\njust say no.\"",
      "\"I can?\" Harry croaked.",
      "\"Yes, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. His voice sounded sad now, and\nworried. \"It seems that you're afraid of me, Harry. May I ask what\nI've done to earn your distrust?\"",
      "Harry swallowed. \"Is there some way you can swear a binding\nmagical oath that you won't take my cloak?\"",
      "Dumbledore shook his head slowly. \"Unbreakable Vows are not to\nbe used so lightly. And besides, Harry, if you did not already know\nthe spell, you would have only my word that the spell was binding.\nYet surely you realise that I do not need your permission\nto see the Cloak. I am powerful enough to draw it forth myself,\nmokeskin pouch or no.\" Dumbledore's face was very grave. \"But this\nI will not do. The Cloak is yours, Harry. I will not seize it from\nyou. Not even to look at for just a moment, unless you decide to\nshow it to me. That is a promise and an oath. Should I need to\nprohibit you from using it on the school grounds, I will require\nyou to go to your vault at Gringotts and store it there.\"",
      "\"Ah...\" Harry said. He swallowed hard, trying to calm the flood\nof adrenaline and think reasonably. He took the mokeskin pouch off\nhis belt. \"If you really don't need my permission... then\nyou have it.\" Harry held out the pouch to Dumbledore, and bit down\nhard on his lip, sending that signal to himself in case he was\nObliviated afterwards.",
      "The old wizard reached into the pouch, and without saying any\nword of retrieval, drew forth the Cloak of Invisibility.",
      "\"Ah,\" breathed Dumbledore. \"I was right...\" He poured the\nshimmering black velvet mesh through his hand. \"Centuries old, and\nstill as perfect as the day it was made. We have lost much of our\nart over the years, and now I cannot make such a thing myself, no\none can. I can feel the power of it like an echo in my mind, like a\nsong forever being sung without anyone to hear it...\" The wizard\nlooked up from the Cloak. \"Do not sell it,\" he said, \"do not give\nit to anyone as a possession. Think twice before you show it to\nanyone, and ponder three times again before you reveal it is a\nDeathly Hallow. Treat it with respect, for this is indeed a Thing\nof Power.\"",
      "For a moment Dumbledore's face grew wistful...",
      "...and then he handed the Cloak back to Harry.",
      "Harry put it back in his pouch.",
      "Dumbledore's face was grave once more. \"May I ask again, Harry,\nhow you came to distrust me so?\"",
      "Suddenly Harry felt rather ashamed.",
      "\"There was a note with the Cloak,\" Harry said in a small voice.\n\"It said that you would try to take the Cloak from me, if you knew.\nI don't know who left the note, though, I really don't.\"",
      "\"I... see,\" Dumbledore said slowly. \"Well, Harry, I won't impugn\nthe motives of whoever left you that note. Who knows but that they\nthemselves may have had the best of good intentions? They did give\nyou the Cloak, after all.\"",
      "Harry nodded, impressed by Dumbledore's charity, and abashed at\nthe sharp contrast with his own attitude.",
      "The old wizard went on. \"But you and I are both gamepieces of\nthe same color, I think. The boy who finally defeated Voldemort,\nand the old man who held him off long enough for you to save the\nday. I will not hold your caution against you, Harry, we must all\ndo our best to be wise. I will only ask that you think twice and\nponder three times again, the next time someone tells you to\ndistrust me.\"",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" Harry said. He felt wretched at this point, he'd\njust told off Gandalf essentially, and Dumbledore's kindness was\nonly making him feel worse. \"I shouldn't have distrusted you.\"",
      "\"Alas, Harry, in this world...\" The old wizard shook his head.\n\"I cannot even say you were unwise. You did not know me. And in\ntruth there are some at Hogwarts who you would do well not to\ntrust. Perhaps even some you call friends.\"",
      "Harry swallowed. That sounded rather ominous. \"Like who?\"",
      "Dumbledore stood up from his chair, and began examining one of\nhis instruments, a dial with eight hands of varying length.",
      "After a few moments, the old wizard spoke again. \"He probably\nseems to you quite charming,\" said Dumbledore. \"Polite - to you at\nleast. Well-spoken, maybe even admiring. Always ready with a\nhelping hand, a favour, a word of advice -\"",
      "\"Oh, Draco Malfoy!\u202f\" Harry said, feeling rather\nrelieved that it wasn't Hermione or something. \"Oh no, no no no,\nyou've got it all wrong, he's not turning me, I'm turning him.\"",
      "Dumbledore froze where he was peering at the dial. \"You're\nwhat?\u202f\"",
      "\"I'm going to turn Draco Malfoy from the Dark Side,\" Harry said.\n\"You know, make him a good guy.\"",
      "Dumbledore straightened and turned to Harry. He was wearing one\nof the most astonished expressions Harry had ever seen on anyone,\nlet alone someone with a long silver beard. \"Are you certain,\" said\nthe old wizard after a moment, \"that he is ready to be redeemed? I\nfear that whatever goodness you think you see within him is only\nwishful thinking - or worse, a lure, a bait -\"",
      "\"Er, not likely,\" Harry said. \"I mean if he's trying to disguise\nhimself as a good guy he's incredibly bad at it. This isn't a\nquestion of Draco coming up to me and being all charming and me\ndeciding that he must have a hidden core of goodness deep down. I\nselected him for redemption specifically because he's the heir to\nHouse Malfoy and if you had to pick one person to redeem, it would\nobviously be him.\"",
      "Dumbledore's left eye twitched. \"You intend to sow seeds of love\nand kindness in Draco Malfoy's heart because you expect Malfoy's\nheir to prove valuable to you?\"",
      "\"Not just to me!\u202f\" Harry said indignantly. \"To all of\nmagical Britain, if this works out! And he'll have a\nhappier and mentally healthier life himself! Look, I don't have\nenough time to turn everyone away from the Dark Side and\nI've got to ask where the Light can gain the most advantage the\nfastest -\"",
      "Dumbledore started laughing. Laughing a lot harder than Harry\nwould expect, almost howling. It seemed positively\nundignified. An ancient and powerful wizard ought to\nchuckle in deep booming tones, not laugh so hard he was gasping for\nbreath. Harry had once literally fallen out of his chair while\nwatching the Marx Brothers movie Duck Soup, and that was\nhow hard Dumbledore was laughing now.",
      "\"It's not that funny,\" Harry said after a while. He was\nstarting to worry about Dumbledore's sanity again.",
      "Dumbledore got himself under control again with a visible\neffort. \"Ah, Harry, one symptom of the disease called wisdom is\nthat you begin laughing at things that no one else thinks is funny,\nbecause when you're wise, Harry, you start getting the jokes!\" The\nold wizard wiped tears away from his eyes. \"Ah, me. Ah, me. Oft\nevil will shall evil mar indeed, in very deed.\"",
      "Harry's brain took a moment to place the familiar words... \"Hey,\nthat's a Tolkien quote! Gandalf says that!\"",
      "\"Theoden, actually,\" said Dumbledore.",
      "\"You're Muggleborn?\u202f\" Harry said in shock.",
      "\"I'm afraid not,\" said Dumbledore, smiling again. \"I was born\nseventy years before that book was published, dear child. But it\nseems that my Muggleborn students tend to think alike in certain\nways. I have accumulated no fewer than twenty copies of The\nLord of the Rings and three sets of Tolkien's entire collected\nworks, and I treasure every one of them.\" Dumbledore drew his wand\nand held it up and struck a pose. \"You cannot pass! How\ndoes that look?\"",
      "\"Ah,\" Harry said in something approaching complete brain\nshutdown, \"I think you're missing a Balrog.\" And the pink pyjamas\nand squashed mushroom hat were not helping in the slightest.",
      "\"I see.\" Dumbledore sighed and glumly sheathed the wand in his\nbelt. \"I fear there have been precious few Balrogs in my life of\nlate. Nowadays it's all meetings of the Wizengamot where I must try\ndesperately to prevent any work from getting done, and formal\ndinners where foreign politicians compete to see who can be the\nmost obstinate fool. And being mysterious at people, knowing things\nI have no way of knowing, making cryptic statements which can only\nbe understood in hindsight, and all the other small ways in which\npowerful wizards amuse themselves after they have left the part of\nthe pattern that allows them to be heroes. Speaking of which,\nHarry, I have a certain something to give you, something which\nbelonged to your father.\"",
      "\"You do?\" said Harry. \"Gosh, who would have figured.\"",
      "\"Yes indeed,\" said Dumbledore. \"I suppose it is a little\npredictable, isn't it?\" His face turned solemn.\n\"Nonetheless...\"",
      "Dumbledore went back to his desk and sat down, pulling out one\nof the drawers as he did so. He reached in using both arms, and,\nstraining slightly, pulled a rather large and heavy-looking object\nout of the drawer, which he then deposited on his oaken desk with a\nhuge thunk.",
      "\"This,\" Dumbledore said, \"was your father's rock.\"",
      "Harry stared at it. It was light gray, discolored, irregularly\nshaped, sharp-edged, and very much a plain old ordinary large rock.\nDumbledore had deposited it so that it rested on the widest\navailable cross-section, but it still wobbled unstably on his\ndesk.",
      "Harry looked up. \"This is a joke, right?\"",
      "\"It is not,\" said Dumbledore, shaking his head and looking very\nserious. \"I took this from the ruins of James and Lily's home in\nGodric's Hollow, where also I found you; and I have kept it from\nthen until now, against the day when I could give it to you.\"",
      "In the mixture of hypotheses that served as Harry's model of the\nworld, Dumbledore's insanity was rapidly rising in probability. But\nthere was still a substantial amount of probability\nallocated to other alternatives... \"Um, is it a magical\nrock?\"",
      "\"Not so far as I know,\" said Dumbledore. \"But I advise you with\nthe greatest possible stringency to keep it close about your person\nat all times.\"",
      "All right. Dumbledore was probably insane but if he\nwasn't... well, it would be just too embarrassing\nto get in trouble from ignoring the advice of the inscrutable old\nwizard. That had to be like #4 on the list of the Top 100 Obvious\nFailure Modes.",
      "Harry stepped forward and put his hands on the rock, trying to\nfind some angle from which to lift it without cutting himself.\n\"I'll put it in my pouch, then.\"",
      "Dumbledore frowned. \"That may not be close enough to your\nperson. And what if your mokeskin pouch is lost, or stolen?\"",
      "\"You think I should just carry a big rock everywhere I go?\"",
      "Dumbledore gave Harry a serious look. \"That might prove\nwise.\"",
      "\"Ah...\" Harry said. It looked rather heavy. \"I'd think the other\nstudents would tend to ask me questions about that.\"",
      "\"Tell them I ordered you to do it,\" said Dumbledore. \"No one\nwill question that, since they all think I'm insane.\" His face was\nstill perfectly serious.",
      "\"Er, to be honest if you go around ordering your students to\ncarry large rocks I can kind of see why people would think\nthat.\"",
      "\"Ah, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. The old wizard gestured, a sweep\nof one hand that seemed to take in all the mysterious instruments\naround the room. \"When we are young we believe that we know\neverything, and so we believe that if we see no explanation for\nsomething, then no explanation exists. When we are older we realise\nthat the whole universe works by a rhythm and a reason, even if we\nourselves do not know it. It is only our own ignorance which\nappears to us as insanity.\"",
      "\"Reality is always lawful,\" said Harry, \"even if we don't know\nthe law.\"",
      "\"Precisely, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. \"To understand this - and I\nsee that you do understand it - is the essence of\nwisdom.\"",
      "\"So... why do I have to carry this rock exactly?\"",
      "\"I can't think of a reason, actually,\" said Dumbledore.",
      "\"...you can't.\"",
      "Dumbledore nodded. \"But just because I can't think of a reason\ndoesn't mean there is no reason.\"",
      "The instruments ticked on.",
      "\"Okay,\" said Harry, \"I'm not even sure if I should be saying\nthis, but that is simply not the correct way to deal with our\nadmitted ignorance of how the universe works.\"",
      "\"It isn't?\" said the old wizard, looking surprised and\ndisappointed.",
      "Harry had the feeling this conversation was not going to work\nout in his favour, but he carried on regardless. \"No. I don't even\nknow if that fallacy has an official name, but if I had to make one\nup myself, it would be 'privileging the hypothesis' or something\nlike that. How can I put this formally... um... suppose you had a\nmillion boxes, and only one of the boxes contained a diamond. And\nyou had a box full of diamond-detectors, and each diamond-detector\nalways went off in the presence of a diamond, and went off half the\ntime on boxes that didn't have a diamond. If you ran twenty\ndetectors over all the boxes, you'd have, on average, one false\ncandidate and one true candidate left. And then it would just take\none or two more detectors before you were left with the one true\ncandidate. The point being that when there are lots of possible\nanswers, most of the evidence you need goes into just\nlocating the true hypothesis out of millions of\npossibilities - bringing it to your attention in the first place.\nThe amount of evidence you need to judge between two or three\nplausible candidates is much smaller by comparison. So if you just\njump ahead without evidence and promote one particular possibility\nto the focus of your attention, you're skipping over most of the\nwork. Like, you live in a city where there are a million people,\nand there's a murder, and a detective says, well, we've got no\nevidence at all, so have we considered the possibility that\nMortimer Snodgrass did it?\"",
      "\"Did he?\" said Dumbledore.",
      "\"No,\" said Harry. \"But later it turns out that the murderer had\nblack hair, and Mortimer has black hair, so everyone's like, ah,\nlooks like Mortimer did it after all. So it's unfair to Mortimer\nfor the police to promote him to their attention without\nhaving good reasons already in hand to suspect him. When there are\nlots of possibilities, most of the work goes into just\nlocating the true answer - starting to pay attention to\nit. You don't need proof, or the sort of official evidence\nthat scientists or courts demand, but you need some sort of\nhint, and that hint has to discriminate that particular\npossibility from the millions of others. Otherwise you can't just\npluck the right answer out of thin air. You can't even pluck a\npossibility worth thinking about out of thin air. And there's got\nto be a million other things I could do besides carrying around my\nfather's rock. Just because I'm ignorant about the universe doesn't\nmean that I'm unsure about how I should reason in the presence of\nmy uncertainty. The laws for thinking with probabilities are no\nless iron than the laws that govern old-fashioned logic, and what\nyou just did is not allowed.\" Harry paused.\n\"Unless, of course, you have some hint you're not\nmentioning.\"",
      "\"Ah,\" said Dumbledore. He tapped his cheek, looking thoughtful.\n\"An interesting argument, certainly, but doesn't it break down at\nthe point where you make an analogy between a million potential\nmurderers only one of whom committed the murder, and taking one out\nof many possible courses of action, when many possible courses of\naction may all be wise? I do not say that carrying your father's\nrock is the one best possible course of action, only that it is\nwiser to do than not.\"",
      "Dumbledore once again reached into the same desk drawer he had\naccessed earlier, this time seeming to root around inside - at\nleast his arm seemed to be moving. \"I will remark,\" Dumbledore said\nwhile Harry was still trying to sort out how to reply to this\ncompletely unexpected rejoinder, \"that it is a common misconception\nof Ravenclaws that all the smart children are Sorted there, leaving\nnone for other Houses. This is not so; being Sorted to Ravenclaw\nindicates that you are driven by your desire to know things, which\nis not at all the same quality as being intelligent.\" The wizard\nwas smiling as he bent over the drawer. \"Nonetheless, you\ndo seem rather intelligent. Less like an ordinary young\nhero and more like a young mysterious ancient wizard. I think I may\nhave been taking the wrong approach with you, Harry, and that you\nmay be able to understand things that few others could grasp. So I\nshall be daring, and offer you a certain other\nheirloom.\"",
      "\"You don't mean...\" gasped Harry. \"My father... owned\nanother rock?\u202f\"",
      "\"Excuse me,\" said Dumbledore, \"I am still older and\nmore mysterious than you and if there are any revelations to be\nmade then I will do the revealing, thank you... oh, where\nis that thing!\" Dumbledore reached down further into the\ndesk drawer, and still further. His head and shoulders and whole\ntorso disappeared inside until only his hips and legs were sticking\nout, as though the desk drawer was eating him.",
      "Harry couldn't help but wonder just how much stuff was in there\nand what the complete inventory would look like.",
      "Finally Dumbledore rose back up out of the drawer, holding the\nobjective of his search, which he set down on the desk alongside\nthe rock.",
      "It was a used, ragged-edged, worn-spined textbook:\nIntermediate Potion Making by Libatius Borage. There was a\npicture of a smoking vial on the cover.",
      "\"This,\" Dumbledore intoned, \"was your mother's fifth-year\nPotions textbook.\"",
      "\"Which I am to carry with me at all times,\" said Harry.",
      "\"Which holds a terrible secret. A secret whose\nrevelation could prove so disastrous that I must ask you to swear -\nand I do require you to swear it seriously, Harry, whatever you may\nthink of all this - never to tell anyone or anything else.\"",
      "Harry considered his mother's fifth-year Potions textbook,\nwhich, apparently, held a terrible secret.",
      "The problem was that Harry did take that oaths like\nthat very seriously. Any vow was an Unbreakable Vow if made by the\nright sort of person.",
      "And...",
      "\"I'm feeling thirsty,\" Harry said, \"and that is not at all a\ngood sign.\"",
      "Dumbledore entirely failed to ask any questions about this\ncryptic statement. \"Do you swear, Harry?\" said Dumbledore.\nHis eyes gazed intently into Harry's. \"Otherwise I cannot tell\nyou.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harry. \"I swear.\" That was the trouble with being a\nRavenclaw. You couldn't refuse an offer like that or your curiosity\nwould eat you alive, and everyone else knew it.",
      "\"And I swear in turn,\" said Dumbledore, \"that what I am about to\ntell you is the truth.\"",
      "Dumbledore opened the book, seemingly at random, and Harry\nleaned in to see.",
      "\"Do you see these notes,\" Dumbledore said in a voice so low it\nwas almost a whisper, \"written in the margins of the book?\"",
      "Harry squinted slightly. The yellowing pages seemed to be\ndescribing something called a potion of eagle's splendour,\nmany of the ingredients being items that Harry didn't recognise at\nall and whose names didn't appear to derive from English. Scrawled\nin the margin was a handwritten annotation saying, I wonder\nwhat would happen if you used Thestral blood here instead of\nblueberries? and immediately beneath was a reply in different\nhandwriting, You'd get sick for weeks and maybe die.",
      "\"I see them,\" said Harry. \"What about them?\"",
      "Dumbledore pointed to the second scrawl. \"The ones in this\nhandwriting,\" he said, still in that low voice, \"were written by\nyour mother. And the ones in this handwriting,\" moving his\nfinger to indicate the first scrawl, \"were written by me. I would\nturn myself invisible and sneak into her dorm room while she was\nsleeping. Lily thought one of her friends was writing them and they\nhad the most amazing fights.\"",
      "That was the exact point at which Harry realised that the\nHeadmaster of Hogwarts was, in fact, crazy.",
      "Dumbledore was looking at him with a serious expression. \"Do you\nunderstand the implications of what I have just told you,\nHarry?\"",
      "\"Ehhh...\" Harry said. His voice seemed to be stuck. \"Sorry...\nI... not really...\"",
      "\"Ah well,\" said Dumbledore, and sighed. \"I suppose your\ncleverness has limits after all, then. Shall we all just pretend I\ndidn't say anything?\"",
      "Harry rose from his chair, wearing a fixed smile. \"Of course,\"\nHarry said. \"You know it's actually getting rather late in the day\nand I'm a bit hungry, so I should be going down to dinner, really\"\nand Harry made a beeline for the door.",
      "The doorknob entirely failed to turn.",
      "\"You wound me, Harry,\" said Dumbledore's voice in quiet tones\nthat were coming from right behind him. \"Do you not at least\nrealise that what I have told you is a sign of trust?\"",
      "Harry slowly turned around.",
      "In front of him was a very powerful and very insane wizard with\na long silver beard, a hat like a squashed giant mushroom, and\nwearing what looked to Muggle eyes like three layers of bright pink\npyjamas.",
      "Behind him was a door that didn't seem to be working at the\nmoment.",
      "Dumbledore was looking rather saddened and weary, like he wanted\nto lean on a wizard's staff he didn't have. \"Really,\" said\nDumbledore, \"you try anything new instead of following the same\npattern every time for a hundred and ten years, and people all\nstart running away.\" The old wizard shook his head in sorrow. \"I'd\nhoped for better from you, Harry Potter. I'd heard that your own\nfriends also think you mad. I know they are mistaken. Will you not\nbelieve the same of me?\"",
      "\"Please open the door,\" Harry said, his voice trembling. \"If you\never want me to trust you again, open the door.\"",
      "There was the sound behind him of a door opening.",
      "\"There were more things I planned to say to you,\" Dumbledore\nsaid, \"and if you leave now, you will not know what they were.\"",
      "Sometimes Harry absolutely hated being a Ravenclaw.",
      "He's never hurt a student, said Harry's Gryffindor\nside. Just keep remembering that and you'll be sure not to\npanic. You're not going to run away just because things are getting\ninteresting, are you?",
      "You can't just walk out on the Headmaster! said the\nHufflepuff part. What if he starts deducting House points? He\ncould make your school life very difficult if he decides he doesn't\nlike you!",
      "And a piece of himself which Harry didn't much like but couldn't\nquite manage to silence was pondering the potential advantages of\nbeing one of the few friends of this mad old wizard who also\nhappened to be Headmaster, Chief Warlock, and Supreme Mugwump. And\nunfortunately his inner Slytherin seemed to be much better than\nDraco at turning people to the Dark Side, because it was saying\nthings like poor fellow, he looks like he needs someone to talk\nto, doesn't he? and you wouldn't want such a powerful man\nto end up trusting someone less virtuous, would you? and I\nwonder what sort of incredible secrets Dumbledore could tell you\nif, you know, you became friends with him and even I bet\nhe's got a reaallly interesting book collection.",
      "You're all a bunch of lunatics, Harry thought at the\nentire assemblage, but he'd been unanimously outvoted by every\ncomponent part of himself.",
      "Harry turned, took a step towards the open door, reached out,\nand deliberately closed it again. It was a costless sacrifice given\nthat he was staying anyway, Dumbledore could control his movements\nregardless, but maybe it would impress Dumbledore.",
      "When Harry turned back around he saw that the powerful insane\nwizard was once more smiling and looking friendly. That was good,\nmaybe.",
      "\"Please don't do that again,\" Harry said. \"I don't like being\ntrapped.\"",
      "\"I am sorry about that, Harry,\" said Dumbledore in what\nsounded like tones of sincere apology. \"But it would have been\nterribly unwise to let you leave without your father's rock.\"",
      "\"Of course,\" Harry said. \"It wasn't reasonable of me to expect\nthe door to open before I put the quest items in my inventory.\"",
      "Dumbledore smiled and nodded.",
      "Harry went over to the desk, twisted his mokeskin pouch around\nto the front of his belt, and, with some effort, managed to heave\nup the rock in his eleven-year-old arms and feed it in.",
      "He could actually feel the weight slowly diminishing as the\nWidening Lip charm ate the rock, and the burp which followed was\nrather noisy and had a distinctly complaining sound to it.",
      "His mother's fifth-year Potions textbook (which held a secret\nthat was in fact pretty terrible) followed shortly after.",
      "And then Harry's inner Slytherin made a sly suggestion for\ningratiating himself with the Headmaster, which, unfortunately, had\nbeen perfectly pitched in such a way as to gain the support of the\nmajority Ravenclaw faction.",
      "\"So,\" Harry said. \"Um. As long as I'm hanging around, I don't\nsuppose you would like to give me a bit of a tour of your office?\nI'm a bit curious as to what some of these things are,\" and that\nwas his understatement for the month of September.",
      "Dumbledore gazed at him, and then nodded with a slight grin.\n\"I'm flattered by your interest,\" said Dumbledore, \"but I'm afraid\nthere isn't much to say.\" Dumbledore took a step closer to the wall\nand pointed to a painting of a sleeping man. \"These are portraits\nof past Headmasters of Hogwarts.\" He turned and pointed to his\ndesk. \"This is my desk.\" He pointed to his chair. \"This is my chair\n-\"",
      "\"Excuse me,\" Harry said, \"actually I was wondering about those.\"\nHarry pointed to a small cube that was softly whispering\n\"blorple... blorple... blorple\".",
      "\"Oh, the little fiddly things?\" said Dumbledore. \"They came with\nthe Headmaster's office and I have absolutely no idea what most of\nthem do. Although this dial with the eight hands counts\nthe number of, let's call them sneezes, by left-handed witches\nwithin the borders of France, you would not believe how much work\nit took to nail that down. And this one with the golden\nwibblers is my own invention and Minerva is never, ever going to\nfigure out what it's doing.\"",
      "Dumbledore took a step over to the hatrack while Harry was still\nprocessing this. \"Here of course we have the Sorting Hat, I believe\nthe two of you have met. It told me that it was never again to be\nplaced on your head under any circumstances. You're only the\nfourteenth student in history it's said that about, Baba Yaga was\nanother one and I'll tell you about the other twelve when you're\nolder. This is an umbrella. This is another umbrella.\" Dumbledore\ntook another few steps and turned around, now smiling quite\nbroadly. \"And of course, most people who come to my office want to\nsee Fawkes.\"",
      "Dumbledore was standing next to the bird on the golden\nplatform.",
      "Harry came over, rather puzzled. \"This is Fawkes?\"",
      "\"Fawkes is a phoenix,\" said Dumbledore. \"Very rare, very\npowerful magical creatures.\"",
      "\"Ah...\" Harry said. He lowered his head and stared into the\ntiny, beady black eyes, which showed not the slightest sign of\npower or intelligence.",
      "\"Ahhh...\" Harry said again.",
      "He was pretty sure he recognised the shape of the bird. It was\npretty hard to miss.",
      "\"Umm...\"",
      "Say something intelligent! Harry's mind roared at\nitself. Don't just stand there sounding like a gibbering\nmoron!",
      "Well what the heck am I supposed to say?\nHarry's mind fired back.",
      "Anything!",
      "You mean, anything besides \"Fawkes is a chicken\" -",
      "Yes! Anything but that!",
      "\"So, ah, what sort of magic do phoenixes do, then?\"",
      "\"Their tears have the power to heal,\" Dumbledore said. \"They are\ncreatures of fire, and move between all places as easily as fire\nmay extinguish itself in one place and be kindled in another. The\ntremendous strain of their innate magic ages their bodies quickly,\nand yet they are as close to undying as any creature that exists in\nthis world, for whenever their bodies fail them they immolate\nthemselves in a burst of fire and leave behind a hatchling, or\nsometimes an egg.\" Dumbledore came closer and inspected the\nchicken, frowning. \"Hm... looking a little peaky there, I'd\nsay.\"",
      "By the time this statement registered fully in Harry's mind, the\nchicken was already on fire.",
      "The chicken's beak opened, but it didn't have time for so much\nas a single caw before it began to wither and char. The blaze was\nbrief, intense, and entirely self-contained; there was no smell of\nburning.",
      "And then the fire died down only seconds after it had begun,\nleaving behind a tiny, pathetic heap of ashes on the golden\nplatform.",
      "\"Don't look so horrified, Harry!\" said Dumbledore. \"Fawkes\nhasn't been hurt.\" Dumbledore's hand dipped into a pocket, and then\nthe same hand sifted through the ashes and turned up a small\nyellowish egg. \"Look, here's an egg!\"",
      "\"Oh... wow... amazing...\"",
      "\"But now we really should get on with things,\" Dumbledore said.\nLeaving the egg behind in the ashes of the chicken, he returned to\nhis throne and seated himself. \"It's almost time for dinner, after\nall, and we wouldn't want to have to use our Time-Turners.\"",
      "There was a violent power struggle going on in the Government of\nHarry. Slytherin and Hufflepuff had switched sides after seeing the\nHeadmaster of Hogwarts set fire to a chicken.",
      "\"Yes, things,\" said Harry's lips. \"And then dinner.\"",
      "You're sounding like a gibbering moron again observed\nHarry's Internal Critic.",
      "\"Well,\" Dumbledore said. \"I fear I have a confession to make,\nHarry. A confession and an apology.\"",
      "\"Apologies are good\" that doesn't even make sense! What am I\ntalking about?",
      "The old wizard sighed deeply. \"You may not still think so after\nunderstanding what I have to say. I'm afraid, Harry, that I've been\nmanipulating you your entire life. It was I who consigned you to\nthe care of your wicked stepparents -\"",
      "\"My stepparents aren't wicked!\" blurted Harry. \"My\nparents, I mean!\"",
      "\"They aren't?\" Dumbledore said, looking surprised and\ndisappointed. \"Not even a little wicked? That doesn't fit the\npattern...\"",
      "Harry's inner Slytherin screamed at the top of its mental lungs,\nSHUT UP YOU IDIOT HE'LL TAKE YOU AWAY FROM THEM!",
      "\"No, no,\" said Harry, lips frozen in a ghastly grimace, \"I was\njust trying to spare your feelings, they're actually very\nwicked...\"",
      "\"They are?\" Dumbledore leaned forward, gazing at him intently.\n\"What do they do?\"",
      "Talk fast \"they, ah, I have to do dishes and wash\nproblems and they don't let me read a lot of books and -\"",
      "\"Ah, good, that's good to hear,\" said Dumbledore, leaning back\nagain. He smiled in a sad sort of way. \"I apologise for\nthat, then. Now where was I? Ah, yes. I'm sorry to say,\nHarry, that I am responsible for virtually everything bad that has\never happened to you. I know that this will probably make you very\nangry.\"",
      "\"Yes, I'm very angry!\" said Harry. \"Grrr!\"",
      "Harry's Internal Critic promptly awarded him the All-Time Award\nfor the Worst Acting in the History of Ever.",
      "\"And I just wanted you to know,\" Dumbledore said, \"I wanted to\ntell you as early as possible, in case something happens to one of\nus later, that I am truly, truly sorry. For everything that has\nalready happened, and everything that will.\"",
      "Moisture glistened in the old wizard's eyes.",
      "\"And I'm very angry!\" said Harry. \"So angry that I want to leave\nright now unless you've got anything else to say!\"",
      "Just GO before he sets you on fire! shrieked Slytherin,\nHufflepuff, and Gryffindor.",
      "\"I understand,\" said Dumbledore. \"One last thing then, Harry.\nYou are not to attempt the forbidden door on the\nthird-floor corridor. There's no possible way you could get through\nall the traps, and I wouldn't want to hear that you'd been hurt\ntrying. Why, I doubt that you could so much as open the first door,\nsince it's locked and you don't know the spell Alohomora\n-\"",
      "Harry spun around and bolted for the exit at top speed, the\ndoorknob turned agreeably in his hand and then he was racing down\nthe spiral stairs even as they turned, his feet almost stumbling\nover themselves, in just a moment he was at the bottom and the\ngargoyle was walking aside and Harry fired out of the stairwell\nlike a cannonball.",
      "Harry Potter.",
      "There must have been something about Harry Potter.",
      "It was Thursday for everyone, after all, and yet this sort of\nthing didn't seem to happen to anyone else.",
      "It was 6:21pm on Thursday afternoon when Harry Potter, firing\nout of the stairwell like a cannonball and accelerating at top\nspeed, ran directly into Minerva McGonagall as she was turning a\ncorner on her way to the Headmaster's office.",
      "Thankfully neither of them were much hurt. As had been explained\nto Harry a little earlier in the day - back when he was refusing to\ngo anywhere near a broomstick again - Quidditch needed solid iron\nBludgers just to stand a decent chance of injuring the players,\nsince wizards tended to be a lot more resistant than Muggles to\nimpacts.",
      "Harry and Professor McGonagall did both end up on the floor, and\nthe parchments she had been carrying went all over the\ncorridor.",
      "There was a terrible, terrible pause.",
      "\"Harry Potter,\" breathed Professor McGonagall from where she was\nlying on the floor right next to Harry. Her voice rose to nearly a\nshriek. \"What were you doing in the Headmaster's\noffice?\"",
      "\"Nothing!\" squeaked Harry.",
      "\"Were you talking about the Defence Professor?\"",
      "\"No! Dumbledore called me up there and he gave me this big rock\nand said it was my father's and I should carry it everywhere!\"",
      "There was another terrible pause.",
      "\"I see,\" said Professor McGonagall, her voice a little calmer.\nShe stood up, brushed herself off, and glared at the scattered\nparchments, which jumped into a neat stack and scurried back\nagainst the corridor wall as though to hide from her gaze. \"My\nsympathies, Mr. Potter, and I apologise for doubting you.\"",
      "\"Professor McGonagall,\" Harry said. His voice was wavering. He\npushed himself off the floor, stood, and looked up at her\ntrustworthy, sane face. \"Professor McGonagall...\"",
      "\"Yes, Mr. Potter?\"",
      "\"Do you think I should?\" Harry said in a small voice. \"Carry my\nfather's rock everywhere?\"",
      "Professor McGonagall sighed. \"That is between you and the\nHeadmaster, I'm afraid.\" She hesitated. \"I will say that ignoring\nthe Headmaster completely is almost never wise. I am sorry\nto hear of your dilemma, Mr. Potter, and if there's any way I\ncan help you with whatever you decide to do -\"",
      "\"Um,\" Harry said. \"Actually I was thinking that once I know how,\nI could Transfigure the rock into a ring and wear it on my finger.\nIf you could teach me how to sustain a Transfiguration -\"",
      "\"It is good that you asked me first,\" Professor McGonagall said,\nher face growing a bit stern. \"If you lost control of the\nTransfiguration the reversal would cut off your finger and probably\nrip your hand in half. And at your age, even a ring is too large a\ntarget for you to sustain indefinitely without it being a serious\ndrain on your magic. But I can have a ring forged for you with a\nsetting for a jewel, a small jewel, in contact with your\nskin, and you can practice sustaining a safe subject, like a\nmarshmallow. When you have kept it up successfully, even in your\nsleep, for a full month, I will allow you to Transfigure, ah, your\nfather's rock...\" Professor McGonagall's voice trailed off. \"Did\nthe Headmaster really -\"",
      "\"Yes. Ah... um...\"",
      "Professor McGonagall sighed. \"That's a bit strange even for\nhim.\" She stooped and picked up the stack of parchments. \"I'm sorry\nabout this, Mr. Potter. I apologise again for mistrusting you. But\nnow it's my own turn to see the Headmaster.\"",
      "\"Ah... good luck, I guess. Er...\"",
      "\"Thank you, Mr. Potter.\"",
      "\"Um...\"",
      "Professor McGonagall walked over to the gargoyle, inaudibly\nspoke the password, and stepped through into the revolving spiral\nstairs. She began to rise out of sight, and the gargoyle started\nback -",

      "It was breakfast time on Friday morning. Harry took another huge\nbite out of his toast and then tried to remind his brain that\nscarfing his breakfast wouldn't actually get him into the dungeons\nany faster. Anyway they had a full hour of study time between\nbreakfast and the start of Potions.",
      "But dungeons! In Hogwarts! Harry's imagination was already\nsketching the chasms, narrow bridges, torchlit sconces, and patches\nof glowing moss. Would there be rats? Would there be\ndragons?",
      "\"Harry Potter,\" said a quiet voice from behind him.",
      "Harry looked over his shoulder and found himself beholding Ernie\nMacmillan, smartly dressed in yellow-trimmed robes and looking a\nlittle worried.",
      "\"Neville thought I should warn you,\" Ernie said in a low voice.\n\"I think he's right. Be careful of the Potions Master in our\nsession today. The older Hufflepuffs told us that Professor Snape\ncan be really nasty to people he doesn't like, and he doesn't like\nmost people who aren't Slytherins. If you say anything smart to him\nit... it could be really bad for you, from what I've heard. Just\nkeep your head down and don't give him any reason to notice\nyou.\"",
      "There was a pause as Harry processed this, and then he lifted\nhis eyebrows. (Harry wished he could raise just one eyebrow, like\nSpock, but he'd never been able to manage.) \"Thanks,\" Harry said.\n\"You might've just saved me a lot of trouble.\"",
      "Ernie nodded, and turned to go back to the Hufflepuff table.",
      "Harry resumed eating his toast.",
      "It was around four bites afterward that someone said \"Pardon\nme,\" and Harry turned around to see an older Ravenclaw, looking a\nlittle worried -",
      "Some time later, Harry was finishing up his third plate of\nrashers. (He'd learned to eat heavily at breakfast. He could always\neat lightly at lunch if he didn't end up using the Time-Turner.)\nAnd there was yet another voice from behind him saying \"Harry?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry said wearily, \"I'll try not to draw Professor\nSnape's attention -\"",
      "\"Oh, that's hopeless,\" said Fred.",
      "\"Completely hopeless,\" said George.",
      "\"So we had the house elves bake you a cake,\" said Fred.",
      "\"We're going to put one candle on it for every point you lose\nfor Ravenclaw,\" said George.",
      "\"And have a party for you at the Gryffindor table during lunch,\"\nsaid Fred.",
      "\"We hope that'll cheer you up afterward,\" finished George.",
      "Harry swallowed his last bite of rasher and turned around. \"All\nright,\" said Harry. \"I wasn't going to ask this after Professor\nBinns, I really wasn't, but if Professor Snape is that\nawful why hasn't he been fired?\"",
      "\"Fired?\" said Fred.",
      "\"You mean, let go?\" said George.",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry said. \"It's what you do to bad teachers. You fire\nthem. Then you hire a better teacher instead. You don't have unions\nor tenure here, right?\"",
      "Fred and George were frowning in much the same way that\nhunter-gatherer tribal elders might frown if you tried to tell them\nabout calculus.",
      "\"I don't know,\" said Fred after a while. \"I never thought about\nthat.\"",
      "\"Me neither,\" said George.",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Harry, \"I get that a lot. See you at lunch, guys,\nand don't blame me if there aren't any candles on that cake.\"",
      "Fred and George both laughed, as if Harry had said something\nfunny, and bowed to him and headed back toward Gryffindor.",
      "Harry turned back to the breakfast table and grabbed a cupcake.\nHis stomach already felt full, but he had a feeling this morning\nmight use a lot of calories.",
      "As he ate his cupcake, Harry thought of the worst teacher he'd\nmet so far, Professor Binns of History. Professor Binns was a\nghost. From what Hermione had said about ghosts, it didn't seem\nlikely that they were fully self-aware. There were no famous\ndiscoveries made by ghosts, or much of any original work, no matter\nwho they'd been in life. Ghosts tended to have trouble remembering\nthe current century. Hermione had said they were like accidental\nportraits, impressed into the surrounding matter by a burst of\npsychic energy accompanying a wizard's sudden death.",
      "Harry had run into some stupid teachers during his abortive\nforays into standard Muggle education - his father had been a lot\npickier when it came to selecting grad students as tutors, of\ncourse - but History class was the first time he'd encountered a\nteacher who literally wasn't sentient.",
      "And it showed, too. Harry had given up after five minutes and\nstarted reading a textbook. When it became clear that \"Professor\nBinns\" wasn't going to object, Harry had also reached into his\npouch and gotten earplugs.",
      "Did ghosts not require a salary? Was that it? Or was it\nliterally impossible to fire anyone in Hogwarts even if they\ndied?",
      "Now it seemed that Professor Snape was going about being\nabsolutely awful to everyone who wasn't a Slytherin and it hadn't\neven occurred to anyone to terminate his contract.",
      "And the Headmaster had set fire to a chicken.",
      "\"Excuse me,\" came a worried voice from behind him.",
      "\"I swear,\" Harry said without turning around, \"this place is\nalmost eight and a half percent as bad as what Dad says about\nOxford.\"",
      "Harry stamped down the stone corridors, looking affronted,\nannoyed, and infuriated all at once.",
      "\"Dungeons!\" Harry hissed. \"Dungeons! These are not\ndungeons! This is a basement! A basement!\u202f\"",
      "Some of the Ravenclaw girls gave him odd looks. The boys were\nall used to him by now.",
      "It seemed that the level in which the Potions classroom was\nlocated was called the \"dungeons\" for no better reason than that it\nwas below ground and slightly colder than the main castle.",
      "In Hogwarts! In Hogwarts! Harry had been\nwaiting his whole life and now he was still waiting and if\nthere was anywhere on the face of the Earth that had\ndecent dungeons it ought to be Hogwarts! Was Harry going to have to\nbuild his own castle if he wanted to see one little bottomless\nabyss?",
      "A short time later they got to the actual Potions classroom and\nHarry cheered up considerably.",
      "The Potions classroom had strange preserved creatures floating\nin huge jars on shelves that covered every centimeter of wall space\nbetween the closets. Harry had gotten far enough along in his\nreading now that he could actually identify some of the creatures,\nlike the Zabriskan Fontema. Albeit the fifty-centimeter spider\nlooked like an Acromantula but it was too small to\nbe one. He'd tried asking Hermione, but she hadn't seemed\nvery interested in looking anywhere near where he was pointing.",
      "Harry was looking at a large dust ball with eyes and feet when\nthe assassin swept into the room.",
      "That was the first thought that crossed Harry's mind when he saw\nProfessor Severus Snape. There was something quiet and deadly about\nthe way the man stalked between the children's desks. His robes\nwere unkempt, his hair spotted and greasy. There was something\nabout him that seemed reminiscent of Lucius, although the two of\nthem looked nothing remotely alike, and you got the impression that\nwhere Lucius would kill you with flawless elegance, this man would\nsimply kill you.",
      "\"Sit down,\" said Professor Severus Snape. \"Now.\"",
      "Harry and a few other children who had been standing around\ntalking to each other scrambled for desks. Harry had planned on\nending up next to Hermione but somehow he found himself sitting\ndown in the nearest empty desk next to Justin Finch-Fletchley (it\nwas a Doubles session, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff) which put him two\ndesks to the left of Hermione.",
      "Severus seated himself behind the teacher's desk, and without\nthe slightest transition or introduction, said, \"Hannah\nAbbott.\"",
      "\"Here,\" said Hannah in a somewhat trembling voice.",
      "\"Susan Bones.\"",
      "\"Present.\"",
      "And so it went, no one daring to say a word in edgewise,\nuntil:",
      "\"Ah, yes. Harry Potter. Our new... celebrity.\"",
      "\"The celebrity is present, sir.\"",
      "Half the class flinched, and some of the smarter ones suddenly\nlooked like they wanted to run out the door while the classroom was\nstill there.",
      "Severus smiled in an anticipatory sort of way and called the\nnext name on his list.",
      "Harry gave a mental sigh. That had happened way too fast for him\nto do anything about it. Oh well. Clearly this man already didn't\nlike him, for whatever reason. And when Harry thought about it,\nbetter by far that this Potions professor should pick on\nhim rather than, say, Neville or Hermione. Harry was a lot\nbetter able to defend himself. Yep, probably all for the best.",
      "When full attendance had been taken, Severus swept his gaze over\nthe full class. His eyes were as empty as a night sky without\nstars.",
      "\"You are here,\" Severus said in a quiet voice which the students\nat back strained to hear, \"to learn the subtle science and exact\nart of potionmaking. As there is little foolish wand-waving here,\nmany of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you\nwill really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron\nwith its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep\nthrough human veins,\" this in a rather caressing, gloating tone,\n\"bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses,\" this was just getting\ncreepier and creepier. \"I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew\nglory, even stopper death - if you aren't as great a pack of fools\nas I usually have to teach.\"",
      "Severus somehow seemed to notice the look of skepticism on\nHarry's face, or at least his eyes suddenly jumped to where Harry\nwas sitting.",
      "\"Potter!\" snapped the Potions professor. \"What would I get if I\nadded powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\"",
      "Harry blinked. \"Was that in Magical Drafts and\nPotions?\" he said. \"I just finished reading it, and I don't\nremember anything which used wormwood -\"",
      "Hermione's hand went up and Harry shot her a glare which caused\nher to raise her hand even higher.",
      "\"Tut, tut,\" Severus said silkily. \"Fame clearly isn't\neverything.\"",
      "\"Really?\" Harry said. \"But you just told us you'd teach us how\nto bottle fame. Say, how does that work, exactly? You\ndrink it and turn into a celebrity?\"",
      "Three-quarters of the class flinched.",
      "Hermione's hand was dropping slowly back down. Well, that wasn't\nsurprising. She might be his rival, but she wasn't the sort of girl\nwho would play along after it became clear that the professor was\ndeliberately trying to humiliate him.",
      "Harry was trying hard to keep control of his temper. The first\nrejoinder that had crossed his mind was 'Abracadabra'.",
      "\"Let's try again,\" said Severus. \"Potter, where would you look\nif I told you to find me a bezoar?\"",
      "\"That's not in the textbook either,\" Harry said, \"but in one\nMuggle book I read that a trichinobezoar is a mass of solidified\nhair found in a human stomach, and Muggles used to believe it would\ncure any poison -\"",
      "\"Wrong,\" Severus said. \"A bezoar is found in the stomach of a\ngoat, it is not made of hair, and it will cure most poisons but not\nall.\"",
      "\"I didn't say it would, I said that was what I read in\none Muggle book -\"",
      "\"No one here is interested in your pathetic Muggle\nbooks. Final try. What is the difference, Potter, between\nmonksblood and wolfsbane?\"",
      "That did it.",
      "\"You know,\" Harry said icily, \"in one of my quite\nfascinating Muggle books, they describe a study in which\npeople managed to make themselves look very smart by asking\nquestions about random facts that only they knew. Apparently the\nonlookers only noticed that the askers knew and the answerers\ndidn't, and failed to adjust for the unfairness of the underlying\ngame. So, Professor, can you tell me how many electrons are in the\noutermost orbital of a carbon atom?\"",
      "Severus's smile widened. \"Four,\" he said. \"It is a useless fact\nwhich no one should bother writing down, however. And for your\ninformation, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion\nso powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. As for\nmonkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes\nby the name of aconite, as you would know if you had read One\nThousand Magical Herbs and Fungi. Thought you didn't need to\nopen the book before coming, eh, Potter? All the rest of you should\nbe copying that down so that you will not be as ignorant as him.\"\nSeverus paused, looking quite pleased with himself. \"And that will\nbe... five points? No, let us make it an even ten points from\nRavenclaw for backchat.\"",
      "Hermione gasped, along with a number of others.",
      "\"Professor Severus Snape,\" Harry bit out. \"I know of nothing\nwhich I have done to earn your enmity. If there is some problem you\nhave with me which I do not know about, I suggest we -\"",
      "\"Shut up, Potter. Ten more points from Ravenclaw. The rest of\nyou, open your books to page 3.\"",
      "There was only a slight, only a very faint burning sensation in\nthe back of Harry's throat, and no moisture at all in his eyes. If\ncrying was not an effective strategy for destroying this Potions\nprofessor then there was no point in crying.",
      "Slowly, Harry sat up very straight. All his blood seemed to have\nbeen drained away and replaced with liquid nitrogen. He knew he'd\nbeen trying to keep his temper but he couldn't seem to remember\nwhy.",
      "\"Harry,\" whispered Hermione frantically from two desks over,\n\"stop, please, it's all right, we won't count it -\"",
      "\"Talking in class, Granger? Three -\"",
      "\"So,\" said a voice colder than zero Kelvin, \"how does one go\nabout filing a formal complaint against an abusive professor? Does\none talk to the Deputy Headmistress, write a letter to the Board of\nGovernors... would you care to explain how it works?\"",
      "The class was utterly frozen.",
      "\"Detention for one month, Potter,\" Severus said, smiling even\nmore broadly.",
      "\"I decline to recognize your authority as a teacher and I will\nnot serve any detention you give.\"",
      "People stopped breathing.",
      "Severus's smile vanished. \"Then you will be -\" his voice stopped\nshort.",
      "\"Expelled, were you about to say?\" Harry, on the other hand, was\nnow smiling thinly. \"But then you seemed to doubt your ability to\ncarry out the threat, or fear the consequences if you did. I, on\nthe other hand, neither doubt nor fear the prospect of finding a\nschool with less abusive professors. Or perhaps I should hire\nprivate tutors, as is my accustomed practice, and be taught at my\nfull learning speed. I have enough money in my vault. Something\nabout bounties on a Dark Lord I defeated. But there are\nteachers at Hogwarts who I rather like, so I think it will be\neasier if I find some way to get rid of you instead.\"",
      "\"Get rid of me?\" Severus said, now also smiling thinly. \"What an\namusing conceit. How do you suppose you will do that, Potter?\"",
      "\"I understand there have been a number of complaints about you\nfrom students and their parents,\" a guess but a safe one, \"which\nleaves only the question of why you're not already gone. Is\nHogwarts too financially strapped to afford a real Potions\nprofessor? I could chip in, if so. I'm sure they could find a\nbetter class of teacher if they offered double your current\nsalary.\"",
      "Two poles of ice radiated freezing winter across the\nclassroom.",
      "\"You will find,\" Severus said softly, \"that the Board of\nGoverners is not the slightest bit sympathetic to your offer.\"",
      "\"Lucius...\" Harry said. \"That's why you're still here.\nPerhaps I should chat with Lucius about that. I believe he desires\nto meet with me. I wonder if I have anything he wants?\"",
      "Hermione frantically shook her head. Harry noticed out of the\ncorner of his eye, but his attention was all on Severus.",
      "\"You are a very foolish boy,\" Severus said. He wasn't smiling at\nall, now. \"You have nothing that Lucius values more than my\nfriendship. And if you did, I have other allies.\" His voice grew\nhard. \"And I find it increasingly unlikely that you were not Sorted\ninto Slytherin. How was it that you managed to stay out of my\nHouse? Ah, yes, because the Sorting Hat claimed it was\njoking. For the first time in recorded history. What were\nyou really chatting about with the Sorting Hat, Potter?\nDid you have something that it wanted?\"",
      "Harry stared into Severus's cold gaze and remembered that the\nSorting Hat had warned him not to meet anyone's eyes while thinking\nabout - Harry dropped his gaze to Severus's desk.",
      "\"You seem oddly reluctant to look me in the eyes, Potter!\"",
      "A shock of sudden understanding - \"So it was you the\nSorting Hat was warning me about!\"",
      "\"What?\" said Severus's voice, sounding genuinely surprised,\nthough of course Harry didn't look at his face.",
      "Harry got up out of his desk.",
      "\"Sit down, Potter,\" said an angry voice from somewhere he wasn't\nlooking.",
      "Harry ignored it, and looked around the classroom. \"I have no\nintention of letting one unprofessional teacher ruin my time at\nHogwarts,\" Harry said with deadly calm. \"I think I'll take my leave\nof this class, and either hire a tutor to teach me Potions while\nI'm here, or if the Board is really that locked up, learn over the\nsummer. If any of you decide that you don't care to be bullied by\nthis man, my sessions will be open to you.\"",
      "\"Sit down, Potter!\u202f\"",
      "Harry strode across the room and grasped the doorknob.",
      "It didn't turn.",
      "Harry slowly turned around, and caught a glimpse of Severus\nsmiling nastily before he remembered to look away.",
      "\"Open this door.\"",
      "\"No,\" said Severus.",
      "\"You are making me feel threatened,\" said a voice so icy it\ndidn't sound like Harry's at all, \"and that is a mistake.\"",
      "Severus's voice laughed. \"What do you intend to do about it,\nlittle boy?\"",
      "Harry took six long strides forward away from the door, until he\nwas standing near the back row of desks.",
      "Then Harry drew himself upright and raised his right hand in one\nterrible motion, fingers poised to snap.",
      "Neville screamed and dived under his desk. Other children shrank\nback or instinctively raised their arms to shield themselves.",
      "\"Harry don't!\u202f\" shrieked Hermione. \"Whatever you were\ngoing to do to him, don't do it!\"",
      "\"Have you all gone mad?\u202f\" barked Severus's voice.",
      "Slowly, Harry lowered his hand. \"I wasn't going to hurt him,\nHermione,\" Harry said, his voice a little lower. \"I was just going\nto blow up the door.\"",
      "Though now that Harry remembered it, you weren't supposed to\nTransfigure things that were to be burned, which meant that going\nback in time afterward and getting Fred or George to Transfigure\nsome carefully measured amount of explosives might not actually\nhave been such a good idea...",
      "\"Silencio,\" said Severus's voice.",
      "Harry tried to say \"What?\" and found that no sound was coming\nout.",
      "\"This has become ridiculous. I think you've been allowed to get\nyourself in enough trouble for one day, Potter. You are the most\ndisruptive and unruly student I have ever seen, and I don't recall\nhow many points Ravenclaw has right now, but I'm sure I can manage\nto wipe them all out. Ten points from Ravenclaw. Ten points from\nRavenclaw. Ten points from Ravenclaw! Fifty points from Ravenclaw!\nNow sit down and watch the rest of the class take their\nlesson!\"",
      "Harry put his hand into his pouch and tried to say 'marker' but\nof course no words came out. For one brief moment that stopped him;\nand then it occurred to Harry to spell out M-A-R-K-E-R using finger\nmotions, which worked. P-A-D and he had a pad of paper. Harry\nstrode over to an empty desk, not the one he'd originally sat down\nin, and scrawled a brief message. He tore off that sheet of paper,\nput away the marker and pad in a pocket of his robes for quicker\naccess, and held up his message, not to Snape, but to the rest of\nthe class.",
      "I'M LEAVING\nDOES ANYONE ELSE\nNEED TO GET OUT?",
      "\"You're insane, Potter,\" Severus said with cold contempt.",
      "Aside from that, no one spoke.",
      "Harry swept an ironic bow to the teacher's desk, walked over to\nthe wall, and with one smooth motion yanked open a closet door,\nstepped in, and slammed the door shut behind him.",
      "There was the muffled sound of someone snapping his fingers, and\nthen nothing.",
      "In the classroom, students looked at each other in puzzlement\nand fear.",
      "The Potions Master's face was now completely enraged. He crossed\nthe room in terrible strides and yanked open the closet door.",
      "The closet was empty.",
      "One hour earlier, Harry listened from inside the closed closet.\nThere was no sound from outside, and no point in taking risks\neither.",
      "C-L-O-A-K, his fingers spelled out.",
      "Once he was invisible, he very carefully and slowly cracked open\nthe closet door and peeked out. No one seemed to be in the\nclassroom.",
      "The door wasn't locked.",
      "It was when Harry was outside the dangerous place and inside the\nhallway, safely invisible, that some of the anger drained away and\nhe realized what he'd just done.",
      "What he'd just done.",
      "Harry's invisible face was frozen in absolute horror.",
      "He'd antagonized a teacher three orders of magnitude beyond\nanything he'd ever managed before. He'd threatened to walk out of\nHogwarts and might have to follow through on it. He'd lost all the\npoints Ravenclaw had and then he'd used the Time-Turner...",
      "His imagination showed him his parents yelling at him after he\nwas expelled, Professor McGonagall disappointed in him, and it was\njust too painful and he couldn't bear it and he couldn't think\nof any way to save himself -",
      "The thought that Harry allowed himself to think was that if\ngetting angry had gotten him into all this trouble, then maybe when\nhe was angry he'd think of a way out, things seemed clearer somehow\nwhen he was angry.",
      "And the thought that Harry didn't let himself think was that he\njust couldn't face this future if he wasn't angry.",
      "So he cast his thoughts back and remembered the burning\nhumiliation -",
      "Tut, tut. Fame clearly isn't everything.",
      "Ten points from Ravenclaw for backchat.",
      "The calming cold washed back through his veins like a wave\nreflected and returning from some breaker, and Harry let out his\nbreath.",
      "Okay. Back to being sane now.",
      "He was actually feeling a bit disappointed in his non-angry self\nfor collapsing like that and wanting only to get out of trouble.\nProfessor Severus Snape was everyone's problem.\nNormal-Harry had forgotten that and wished for a way to protect\nhimself. And let all the other victims go hang? The\nquestion wasn't how to protect himself, the question was how to\ndestroy this Potions professor.",
      "So this is my dark side, is it? Bit of a prejudiced\nterm that, my light side seems more selfish and cowardly, not to\nmention confused and panicky.",
      "And now that he was thinking clearly, it was equally clear what\nto do next. He'd already given himself an extra hour to prepare,\nand could get up to five hours more if required...",
      "Minerva McGonagall waited in the Headmaster's office.",
      "Dumbledore sat in his padded throne behind his desk, dressed in\nfour layers of formal lavender robes. Minerva sat in a chair before\nhim, opposite Severus in another chair. Facing the three of them\nwas an empty wooden stool.",
      "They were waiting for Harry Potter.",
      "Harry, Minerva thought despairingly, you promised\nyou wouldn't bite any teachers!",
      "And in her mind she could see very clearly the reply, Harry's\nangry face and his outraged response: I said I wouldn't bite\nanyone who didn't bite me first!",
      "There was a knock at the door.",
      "\"Come in!\" Dumbledore called.",
      "The door swept open, and Harry Potter entered. Minerva almost\ngasped out loud. The boy looked cool, collected, and utterly in\ncontrol of himself.",
      "\"Good mor-\" Harry's voice suddenly cut off. His jaw dropped.",
      "Minerva tracked Harry's gaze, and she saw that Harry was staring\nat Fawkes where the phoenix sat on its golden perch. Fawkes\nfluttered his bright red-golden wings like the flickering of a\nflame, and dipped his head in a measured nod to the boy.",
      "Harry turned to stare at Dumbledore.",
      "Dumbledore winked at him.",
      "Minerva felt she was missing something.",
      "Sudden uncertainty crossed Harry's face. His coolness wavered.\nFear showed in his eyes, then anger, and then the boy was calm\nagain.",
      "A chill went down Minerva's spine. Something was not right\nhere.",
      "\"Please sit down,\" said Dumbledore. His face was now serious\nonce more.",
      "Harry sat.",
      "\"So, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. \"I've heard one report of this day\nfrom Professor Snape. Would you care to tell me what happened in\nyour own words?\"",
      "Harry's gaze flicked dismissively to Severus. \"It's not\ncomplicated,\" said the boy, smiling thinly. \"He tried bullying me\nthe way he's been bullying every non-Slytherin in the school since\nthe day Lucius foisted him off on you. As for the other details, I\nrequest a private conversation with you concerning them. A student\nwho is reporting abusive behavior from a professor can hardly be\nexpected to speak frankly in front of that same professor, after\nall.\"",
      "This time Minerva couldn't stop herself from gasping out\nloud.",
      "Severus simply laughed.",
      "And the Headmaster's face grew grave. \"Mr. Potter,\" the\nHeadmaster said, \"one does not speak of a Hogwarts professor in\nsuch terms. I fear that you labor under a terrible misapprehension.\nProfessor Severus Snape has my fullest confidence, and serves\nHogwarts at my own behest, not Lucius Malfoy's.\"",
      "There was silence for a few moments.",
      "When the boy spoke again his voice was icy. \"Am I missing\nsomething here?\"",
      "\"Quite a number of things, Mr. Potter,\" said the Headmaster.\n\"You should understand, to start with, that the purpose of this\nmeeting is to discuss how to discipline you for the events of this\nmorning.\"",
      "\"This man has terrorized your school for years. I spoke to\nstudents and collected stories to make sure there would be enough\nfor a newspaper campaign to rally the parents against him. Some of\nthe younger students cried while they told me. I almost cried when\nI heard them! You allowed this abuser to run free? You did this\nto your students? Why?\u202f\"",
      "Minerva swallowed a lump in her throat. She'd - thought that,\nsometimes, but somehow she'd never quite -",
      "\"Mr. Potter,\" said the Headmaster, his voice now stern, \"this\nmeeting is not about Professor Snape. It is about you and your\ndisregard for school discipline. Professor Snape has suggested, and\nI have agreed, that three full months of detention will be\nappropriate -\"",
      "\"Declined,\" Harry said icily.",
      "Minerva was speechless.",
      "\"This is not a request, Mr. Potter,\" the Headmaster said. The\nfull, entire force of the wizard's gaze was turned on the boy.\n\"This is your punishme-\"",
      "\"You will explain to me why you allowed this man to hurt the\nchildren placed in your care, and if your explanation is not\nsufficient then I will begin my newspaper campaign with\nyou as the target.\"",
      "Minerva's body swayed with the force of that blow, with the\nsheer raw lese majeste.",
      "Even Severus looked shocked.",
      "\"That, Harry, would be most extremely unwise,\" Dumbledore said\nslowly. \"I am the primary piece opposing Lucius on the gameboard.\nFor you to do such a thing would strengthen him greatly, and I did\nnot think that was your chosen side.\"",
      "The boy was still for a long moment.",
      "\"This conversation grows private,\" Harry said. His hand flicked\nin Severus's direction. \"Send him away.\"",
      "Dumbledore shook his head. \"Harry, did I not tell you that\nSeverus Snape has my fullest confidence?\"",
      "The boy's face showed the shock of it. \"This man's bullying\nmakes you vulnerable! I am not the only one who could start a\nnewspaper campaign against you! This is insane! Why are you doing\nthis?\"",
      "Dumbledore sighed. \"I'm sorry, Harry. It has to do with things\nthat you are not, at this time, ready to hear.\"",
      "The boy stared at Dumbledore. Then he turned to look at Severus.\nThen back to Dumbledore again.",
      "\"It is insanity,\" the boy said slowly. \"You haven't\nreined him in because you think he's part of the pattern.\nThat Hogwarts needs an evil Potions Master to be a proper magical\nschool, just as it needs a ghost to teach History.\"",
      "\"That does sound like the sort of thing I would do, doesn't it?\"\nsaid Dumbledore, smiling.",
      "\"Unacceptable,\" Harry said flatly. His gaze was now cold and\ndark. \"I will not tolerate bullying or abuse. I had considered many\npossible ways of dealing with this problem, but I will make it\nsimple. Either this man goes, or I do.\"",
      "Minerva gasped again. Something strange flickered in Severus's\neyes.",
      "Now Dumbledore's gaze was also growing cold. \"Expulsion, Mr.\nPotter, is the final threat which may be used against a student. It\nis not customarily used as a threat by students against the\nHeadmaster. This is the best magical school in the entire world,\nand an education here is not an opportunity given to everyone. Are\nyou under the impression that Hogwarts cannot get along without\nyou?\"",
      "And Harry sat there, smiling thinly.",
      "Sudden horror dawned on Minerva. Surely Harry wouldn't -",
      "\"You forget,\" Harry said, \"that you're not the only one who can\nsee patterns. This grows private. Now send him -\" Harry\nflicked a hand at Severus again, and then stopped in mid-sentence\nand mid-gesture.",
      "Minerva could see it on Harry's face, the moment when he\nremembered.",
      "She'd told him, after all.",
      "\"Mr. Potter,\" said the Headmaster, \"once again, Severus Snape\nhas my fullest confidence.\"",
      "\"You told him,\" whispered the boy. \"You utter fool.\"",
      "Dumbledore didn't react to the insult. \"Told him what?\"",
      "\"That the Dark Lord is alive.\"",
      "\"What in Merlin's name are you on about, Potter?\u202f\"\ncried Severus in tones of sheer astonishment and outrage.",
      "Harry glanced briefly at him, smiling grimly. \"Oh, so we\nare a Slytherin, then,\" Harry said. \"I was starting to\nwonder.\"",
      "And then there was silence.",
      "Finally Dumbledore spoke. His voice was mild. \"Harry, what\nare you talking about?\"",
      "\"I'm sorry, Albus,\" Minerva whispered.",
      "Severus and Dumbledore turned to look at her.",
      "\"Professor McGonagall didn't tell me,\" said Harry's voice,\nswiftly and less calm than it had been. \"I guessed. I told you, I\ncan see the patterns too. I guessed, and she controlled her\nreaction just as Severus did. But her control fell a shade short of\nperfection, and I could tell it was control, not genuine.\"",
      "\"And I told him,\" said Minerva, her voice trembling a little,\n\"that you, and I, and Severus were the only ones who knew.\"",
      "\"Which she did as a concession to prevent me from simply going\naround asking questions, as I threatened to do if she didn't talk,\"\nHarry said. The boy chuckled briefly. \"I really should have gotten\none of you alone and told you that she told me everything, to see\nif you let anything slip. Probably wouldn't have worked, but would\nhave been worth a shot.\" The boy smiled again. \"Threat's still on\nthe table and I do expect to be briefed fully at some\npoint.\"",
      "Severus was giving her a look of utter contempt. Minerva raised\nher chin and bore it. She knew it was deserved.",
      "Dumbledore leaned back in his padded throne. His eyes were as\ncold as anything Minerva had seen from him since the day his\nbrother died. \"And you threaten to abandon us to Voldemort if we do\nnot comply with your wishes.\"",
      "Harry's voice was razor-sharp. \"I regret to inform you that you\nare not the center of the universe. I'm not threatening to walk out\non magical Britain. I'm threatening to walk out on you. I\nam not a meek little Frodo. This is my quest and if you\nwant in you will play by my rules.\"",
      "Dumbledore's face was still cold. \"I am beginning to doubt your\nsuitability as the hero, Mr. Potter.\"",
      "Harry's return gaze was equally icy. \"I am beginning to doubt\nyour suitability as my Gandalf, Mr. Dumbledore. Boromir\nwas at least a plausible mistake. What is this Nazgul\ndoing in my Fellowship?\"",
      "Minerva was completely lost. She looked at Severus, to see if he\nwas following this, and she saw that Severus had turned his face\naway from Harry's field of vision and was smiling.",
      "\"I suppose,\" Dumbledore said slowly, \"that from your perspective\nit is a reasonable question. So, Mr. Potter, if Professor Snape is\nto leave you alone henceforth, will that be the last time this\nissue arises, or will I find you here every week with a new\ndemand?\"",
      "\"Leave me alone?\" Harry's voice was outraged. \"I am not\nhis only victim and certainly not the most vulnerable! Have you\nforgotten how defenseless children are? How much they hurt?\nHenceforth Severus will treat every student of Hogwarts\nwith appropriate and professional courtesy, or you will find\nanother Potions Master, or you will find another hero!\"",
      "Dumbledore started laughing. Full-throated, warm, humorous\nlaughter, as if Harry had just performed a comic dance in front of\nhim.",
      "Minerva didn't dare move. Her eyes flickered and she saw that\nSeverus was equally motionless.",
      "Harry's visage grew even colder. \"You mistake me, Headmaster, if\nyou think that this is a joke. This is not a request. This is your\npunishment.\"",
      "\"Mr. Potter -\" Minerva said. She didn't even know what she was\ngoing to say. She simply couldn't let that go by.",
      "Harry made a shushing gesture at her and continued to speak to\nDumbledore. \"And if that seems impolite to you,\" Harry said, his\nvoice now a little less hard, \"it seemed no less impolite when you\nsaid it to me. You would not say such a thing to anyone who you\nconsidered a real human being instead of a subordinate child, and I\nwill treat you with just the same courtesy as you treat me -\"",
      "\"Oh, indeed, in very deed, this is my punishment if ever there\nwas one! Of course you're in here blackmailing me to save\nyour fellow students, not to save yourself! I can't imagine why I\nwould have thought otherwise!\" Dumbledore was now laughing even\nharder. He pounded his fist on the desk three times.",
      "Harry's gaze grew uncertain. His face turned toward her,\naddressing her for the first time. \"Excuse me,\" Harry said. His\nvoice seemed to be wavering. \"Does he need to take his medication\nor something?\"",
      "\"Ah...\" Minerva had no idea what she could possibly say.",
      "\"Well,\" said Dumbledore. He wiped away tears that had formed in\nhis eyes. \"Pardon me. I'm sorry for the interruption. Please\ncontinue with the blackmail.\"",
      "Harry opened his mouth, then closed it again. He now seemed a\nlittle unsteady. \"Ah... he's also to stop reading students'\nminds.\"",
      "\"Minerva,\" Severus said, his voice deadly, \"you -\"",
      "\"Sorting Hat warned me,\" said Harry.",
      "\"What?\u202f\"",
      "\"Can't say anything else. Anyway I think that's it. I'm\ndone.\"",
      "Silence.",
      "\"Now what?\" Minerva said, when it became apparent that no one\nelse was going to say anything.",
      "\"Now what?\" Dumbledore echoed. \"Why, now the hero wins, of\ncourse.\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" said Severus, Minerva, and Harry.",
      "\"Well, he certainly seems to have backed us into a corner,\"\nDumbledore said, smiling happily. \"But Hogwarts does need\nan evil Potions Master, or it just wouldn't be a proper magical\nschool, now would it? So how about if Professor Snape is only awful\ntoward students in their fifth year and higher?\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" said all three of them again.",
      "\"If it's the most vulnerable victims about whom you're\nconcerned. Maybe you're right, Harry. Maybe I have\nforgotten over the decades what it's like to be a child. So let's\ncompromise. Severus will continue to unfairly award points to\nSlytherin and impose lax discipline on his House, and he will be\nawful to non-Slytherin students in their fifth year and higher. To\nothers he will be scary, but not abusive. He will promise to only\nread minds when the safety of a student requires it. Hogwarts will\nhave its evil Potions Master, and the most vulnerable victims, as\nyou put it, will be safe.\"",
      "Minerva McGonagall was as shocked as she'd ever been in her\nlife. She glanced uncertainly at Severus, whose face had been left\ncompletely neutral, as though he couldn't decide what sort of\nexpression he ought to be wearing.",
      "\"I suppose that is acceptable,\" Harry said. His voice sounded a\nbit odd.",
      "\"You can't be serious,\" Severus said, his voice as\nexpressionless as his face.",
      "\"I am very much in favor of this,\" Minerva said slowly. She was\nso much in favor that her heart was pounding wildly beneath her\nrobes. \"But what could we possibly tell the students? They might\nnot have questioned this while Severus was... being awful to\neveryone, but -\"",
      "\"Harry can tell the other students that he discovered a terrible\nsecret of Severus's and did a bit of blackmail,\" said Dumbledore.\n\"It's true, after all; he discovered that Severus was reading\nminds, and he certainly did blackmail us.\"",
      "\"This is insanity!\" exploded Severus.",
      "\"Bwah ha ha!\" said Dumbledore.",
      "\"Ah...\" said Harry uncertainly. \"And if anyone asks me why fifth\nyears and above got shafted? I wouldn't blame them for being irate,\nand that part wasn't exactly my idea -\"",
      "\"Tell them,\" said Dumbledore, \"that it wasn't you who suggested\nthe compromise, that it was all you could get. And then refuse to\nsay anything more. That, too, is true. There's an art to it, you'll\npick it up with practice.\"",
      "Harry nodded slowly. \"And the points he took from\nRavenclaw?\"",
      "\"They must not be given back.\"",
      "It was Minerva who said it.",
      "Harry looked at her.",
      "\"I'm sorry, Mr. Potter,\" she said. She was sorry, but\nit had to be done. \"There must be some consequences for\nyour misbehavior or this school will fall to pieces.\"",
      "Harry shrugged. \"Acceptable,\" he said flatly. \"But in the future\nSeverus will not strike at my House connections by taking points\nfrom me, nor will he waste my valuable time with detentions. Should\nhe feel that my behavior requires correction, he may communicate\nhis concerns to Professor McGonagall.\"",
      "\"Harry,\" Minerva said, \"will you continue to submit to school\ndiscipline, or are you to be above the law now, as Severus\nwas?\"",
      "Harry looked at her. Something warm touched his gaze, briefly\nbefore it was quashed. \"I will continue to be an ordinary student\nto every member of the staff who is not insane or evil, provided\nthat they do not come under pressure from others who are.\" Harry\nglanced briefly at Severus, then turned back to Dumbledore. \"Leave\nMinerva alone, and I'll be a regular Hogwarts student in her\npresence. No special privileges or immunities.\"",
      "\"Beautiful,\" Dumbledore said sincerely. \"Spoken like a true\nhero.\"",
      "\"And,\" she said, \"Mr. Potter must publicly apologize for his\nactions of today.\"",
      "Harry gave her another look. This one was a bit skeptical.",
      "\"The discipline of the school has been gravely injured by your\nactions, Mr. Potter,\" Minerva said. \"It must be restored.\"",
      "\"I think, Professor McGonagall, that you considerably\noverestimate the importance of what you call school discipline, as\ncompared to having History taught by a live teacher or not\ntorturing your students. Maintaining the current status hierarchy\nand enforcing its rules seems ever so much more wise and moral and\nimportant when you are on the top and doing the enforcing than when\nyou are on the bottom, and I can cite studies to this effect if\nrequired. I could go on for several hours about this point, but I\nwill leave it at that.\"",
      "Minerva shook her head. \"Mr. Potter, you underestimate the\nimportance of discipline because you are not in need of it yourself\n-\" She paused. That hadn't come out right, and Severus, Dumbledore,\nand even Harry were giving her strange looks. \"To learn, I mean.\nNot every child can learn in the absence of authority. And it is\nthe other children who will be hurt, Mr. Potter, if they see your\nexample as one to be followed.\"",
      "Harry's lips curved into a twisted smile. \"The first and last\nresort is the truth. The truth is that I shouldn't have gotten\nangry, I shouldn't have disrupted the class, I shouldn't have done\nwhat I did, and I set a bad example for everyone. The truth is also\nthat Severus Snape behaved in a fashion unbecoming a Hogwarts\nprofessor, and that from now on he will be more mindful of the\ninjured feelings of students in their fourth year and under. The\ntwo of us could both get up and speak the truth. I could live with\nthat.\"",
      "\"In your dreams, Potter!\" spat Severus.",
      "\"After all,\" said Harry, smiling grimly, \"if the students see\nthat rules are for everyone... for professors too, not\njust for poor helpless students who get nothing but suffering out\nof the system... why, the positive effects on school discipline\nshould be tremendous.\"",
      "There was a brief pause, and then Dumbledore chuckled. \"Minerva\nis thinking that you're righter than you have any right to be.\"",
      "Harry's gaze jerked away from Dumbledore, down to the floor.\n\"Are you reading her mind?\"",
      "\"Common sense is often mistaken for Legilimency,\" said\nDumbledore. \"I shall talk over this matter with Severus, and no\napology will be required from you unless he apologizes as well. And\nnow I declare this matter concluded, at least until lunchtime.\" He\npaused. \"Although, Harry, I'm afraid that Minerva wished to speak\nwith you about an additional matter. And that is not the result of\nany pressure on my part. Minerva, if you would?\"",
      "Minerva rose from her chair and almost fell. There was too much\nadrenaline in her blood, her heart was beating too fast.",
      "\"Fawkes,\" said Dumbledore, \"accompany her, please.\"",
      "\"I don't -\" she started to say.",
      "Dumbledore shot her a look, and she fell silent.",
      "The phoenix soared across the room like a smooth tongue of flame\nleaping out, and landed on her shoulder. She felt the warmth\nthrough her robes, all through her body.",
      "\"Please follow me, Mr. Potter,\" she said, firmly now, and they\nleft through the door.",
      "They stood on the rotating stairs, descending in silence.",
      "Minerva didn't know what to say. She didn't know this person who\nstood beside her.",
      "And Fawkes began to croon.",
      "It was tender, and soft, like a fireplace would sound if it had\nmelody, and it washed over Minerva's mind, easing, soothing,\ngentling what it touched...",
      "\"What is that?\u202f\" Harry whispered beside her.\nHis voice was unstable, wobbling, changing pitch.",
      "\"The song of the phoenix,\" said Minerva, not really aware of\nwhat she was saying, her attention was all on that strange quiet\nmusic. \"It, too, heals.\"",
      "Harry turned his face from her, but she caught a glimpse of\nsomething agonized.",
      "The descent seemed to take a very long time, or maybe it was\nonly that the music seemed to take a very long time, and when they\nstepped out through the gap where a gargoyle had been, she was\nholding Harry's hand firmly in hers.",
      "As the gargoyle stepped back into place, Fawkes left her\nshoulder, and swooped to hover in front of Harry.",
      "Harry stared at Fawkes like someone hypnotized by the\never-changing light of a fire.",
      "\"What am I to do, Fawkes?\" whispered Harry. \"I couldn't have\nprotected them if I hadn't been angry.\"",
      "The phoenix's wings continued flapping, it continued hovering in\nplace. There was no sound but the beating of the wings. Then there\nwas a flash like a fire flaring up and going out, and Fawkes was\ngone.",
      "Both of them blinked, like waking up from a dream, or maybe like\nfalling asleep again.",
      "Minerva looked down.",
      "Harry Potter's bright young face looked up at her.",
      "\"Are phoenixes people?\" said Harry. \"I mean, are they smart\nenough to count as people? Could I talk with Fawkes if I knew\nhow?\"",
      "Minerva blinked hard. Then she blinked again. \"No,\" Minerva\nsaid, her voice wavering. \"Phoenixes are creatures of powerful\nmagic. That magic gives their existence a weight of meaning which\nno simple animal could possess. They are fire, light, healing,\nrebirth. But in the end, no.\"",
      "\"Where can I get one?\"",
      "Minerva leaned down and hugged him. She hadn't meant to, but she\ndidn't seem to have much choice in the matter.",
      "When she stood up she found it hard to speak. But she had to\nask. \"What happened today, Harry?\"",
      "\"I don't know the answers to any of the important questions\neither. Aside from that I'd really rather not think about it for a\nwhile.\"",
      "Minerva took his hand in hers again, and they walked the rest of\nthe way in silence.",
      "It was only a short trip, since naturally the office of the\nDeputy was close to the office of the Headmaster.",
      "Minerva sat behind her desk.",
      "Harry sat in front of her desk.",
      "\"So,\" Minerva whispered. She would have given almost anything\nnot to do this, or not to be the one who had to do it, or for it to\nbe any time but right now. \"There is a matter of school discipline.\nFrom which you are not exempt.\"",
      "\"Namely?\" said Harry.",
      "He didn't know. He hadn't figured it out yet. She felt her\nthroat tighten. But there was work to be done and she would not\nshirk it.",
      "\"Mr. Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall, \"I need to see your\nTime-Turner, please.\"",
      "All the peace of the phoenix vanished from his face in an\ninstant and Minerva felt like she had just stabbed him.",
      "\"No!\u202f\" Harry said. His voice was panicked. \"I need it,\nI won't be able to attend Hogwarts, I won't be able to sleep!\"",
      "\"You'll be able to sleep,\" she said. \"The Ministry has delivered\nthe protective shell for your Time-Turner. I will enchant it to\nopen only between the hours of 9PM and midnight.\"",
      "Harry's face twisted. \"But - but I -\"",
      "\"Mr. Potter, how many times have you used the Time-Turner since\nMonday? How many hours?\"",
      "\"I...\" Harry said. \"Hold on, let me add it up -\" He glanced down\nat his watch.",
      "Minerva felt a rush of sadness. She'd thought so. \"It wasn't\njust two per day, then. I suspect that if I asked your dormmates, I\nwould find that you were struggling to stay up long enough to go to\nsleep at a reasonable time, and waking up earlier and earlier every\nmorning. Correct?\"",
      "Harry's face said everything she needed to know.",
      "\"Mr. Potter,\" she said gently, \"there are students who cannot be\nentrusted with Time-Turners, because they become addicted to them.\nWe give them a potion which lengthens their sleep cycle by the\nnecessary amount, but they end up using the Time-Turner for more\nthan just attending their classes. And so we must take them back.\nMr. Potter, you have taken to using the Time-Turner as your\nsolution to everything, often very foolishly so. You used it to get\nback a Remembrall. You vanished from a closet in a fashion apparent\nto other students, instead of going back after you were out and\ngetting me or someone else to come and open the door.\"",
      "From the look on Harry's face he hadn't thought of that.",
      "\"And more importantly,\" she said, \"you should have simply sat in\nProfessor Snape's class. And watched. And left at the end of class.\nAs you would have done if you had not possessed a Time-Turner.\nThere are some students who cannot be entrusted with Time-Turners,\nMr. Potter. You are one of them. I am sorry.\"",
      "\"But I need it!\" Harry blurted. \"What if there are\nSlytherins threatening me and I have to escape? It keeps me\nsafe -\"",
      "\"Every other student in this castle runs the same risk, and I\nassure you that they survive. No student has died in this castle\nfor fifty years. Mr. Potter, you will hand over your Time-Turner\nand do so now.\"",
      "Harry's face twisted in agony, but he drew out the Time-Turner\nfrom under his robes and gave it to her.",
      "From her desk, Minerva drew out one of the protective shells\nthat had been sent to Hogwarts. She snapped the cover into place\naround the Time-Turner's turning hourglass, and then she laid her\nwand on the cover to complete the enchantment.",
      "\"This isn't fair!\u202f\" Harry shrieked. \"I saved half of\nHogwarts from Professor Snape today, is it right that I be punished\nfor it? I saw the look on your face, you hated what he was\ndoing!\"",
      "Minerva didn't speak for a few moments. She was enchanting.",
      "When she finished and looked up, she knew that her face was\nstern. Maybe it was the wrong thing to do. And then again maybe it\nwas the right thing to do. There was an obstinate child in front of\nher, and that didn't mean the universe was broken.",
      "\"Fair, Mr. Potter?\" she snapped. \"I have had to file\ntwo reports with the Ministry on public use of a\nTime-Turner in two successive days! Be extremely\ngrateful you were allowed to retain the Time-Turner even in\nrestricted form! The Headmaster made a Floo call to plead with them\npersonally and if you were not the Boy-Who-Lived even that would\nnot have sufficed!\"",
      "Harry gaped at her.",
      "She knew that he was seeing the angry face of Professor\nMcGonagall.",
      "Harry's eyes filled up with tears.",
      "\"I'm, sorry,\" he whispered, voice now choked and broken. \"I'm\nsorry, to have, disappointed you...\"",
      "\"I'm sorry too, Mr. Potter,\" she said sternly, and handed him\nthe newly restricted Time-Turner. \"You may go.\"",
      "Harry turned and fled from her office, sobbing. She heard his\nfeet pattering away down the hall, and then the sound cut off as\nthe door swung closed.",
      "\"I'm sorry too, Harry,\" she whispered to the quiet room. \"I'm\nsorry too.\"",
      "Fifteen minutes into lunch hour.",
      "No one was speaking to Harry. Some of the Ravenclaws were\nshooting him looks of anger, others of sympathy, a few of the\nyoungest students even had looks of admiration, but no one was\ntalking to him. Even Hermione hadn't tried to come over.",
      "Fred and George had gingerly stepped near. They hadn't said\nanything. The offer was clear, and its optionality. Harry had told\nthem that he would come over when dessert started, no earlier. They\nhad nodded and quickly walked away.",
      "It was probably the utterly expressionless look on Harry's face\nthat was doing it.",
      "The others probably thought he was controlling anger, or dismay.\nThey knew, because they'd seen Flitwick come and get him, that he'd\nbeen called to the Headmaster's office.",
      "Harry was trying not to smile, because if he smiled, he would\nstart laughing, and if he started laughing, he wouldn't stop until\nthe nice people in white jackets came to haul him away.",
      "It was too much. It was just all too much. Harry had almost gone\nover to the Dark Side, his dark side had done things that seemed in\nretrospect insane, his dark side had won an impossible victory that\nmight have been real and might have been a pure whim of a crazy\nHeadmaster, his dark side had protected his friends. He just\ncouldn't handle it any more. He needed Fawkes to sing to him again.\nHe needed to use the Time-Turner to go off and take a quiet hour to\nrecover but that wasn't an option any more and the loss was like a\nhole in his existence but he couldn't think about that because then\nhe might start laughing.",
      "Twenty minutes. All the students who were going to eat lunch had\narrived, almost none had departed.",
      "The tapping of a spoon rang through the Great Hall.",
      "\"If I may have your attention please,\" Dumbledore said. \"Harry\nPotter has something he would like to share with us.\"",
      "Harry took a deep breath and got up. He walked over to the Head\nTable, with every eye staring at him.",
      "Harry turned and looked out at the four tables.",
      "It was becoming harder and harder not to smile, but Harry kept\nhis face expressionless as he spoke his brief and memorized\nspeech.",
      "\"The truth is sacred,\" Harry said tonelessly. \"One of my most\ntreasured possessions is a button which reads 'Speak the truth,\neven if your voice trembles'. This, then, is the truth. Remember\nthat. I am not saying it because I am being forced to say it, I am\nsaying it because it is true. What I did in Professor Snape's class\nwas foolish, stupid, childish, and an inexcusable violation of the\nrules of Hogwarts. I disrupted the classroom and deprived my fellow\nstudents of their irreplaceable learning time. All because I failed\nto control my temper. I hope that not a single one of you will ever\nfollow my example. I certainly intend to try never to follow it\nagain.\"",
      "Many of the students gazing at Harry now had solemn, unhappy\nlooks upon their faces, such as one might see at a ceremony marking\nthe loss of a fallen champion. At the younger parts of the\nGryffindor table the look was almost universal.",
      "Until Harry raised his hand.",
      "He did not raise it high. That might have appeared preemptory.\nHe certainly did not raise it toward Severus. Harry simply raised\nhis hand to chest level, and softly snapped his fingers, a gesture\nthat was seen more than heard. It was possible that most of the\nHead Table wouldn't see it at all.",
      "This seeming gesture of defiance won sudden smiles from the\nyounger students and Gryffindors, and coldly superior sneers from\nSlytherin, and frowns and worried looks from all others.",
      "Harry kept his face expressionless. \"Thank you,\" he said.\n\"That's all.\"",
      "\"Thank you, Mr. Potter,\" said the Headmaster. \"And now Professor\nSnape has something to share with us as well.\"",
      "Severus smoothly stood up from his place at the Head Table. \"It\nhas been brought to my attention,\" he said, \"that my own actions\nplayed a part in provoking the admittedly inexcusable anger of Mr.\nPotter, and in the ensuing discussion I realized that I had\nforgotten how easily injured are the feelings of the young and\nimmature -\"",
      "There was the sound of many people emitting muffled chokes at\nthe same time.",
      "Severus continued as if he had not heard. \"The Potions classroom\nis a dangerous place, and I still feel that strict discipline is\nnecessary, but henceforth I will be more aware of the... emotional\nfragility... of students in their fourth year and younger. My\ndeduction of points from Ravenclaw still stands, but I will revoke\nMr. Potter's detention. Thank you.\"",
      "There was a single clap from the direction of Gryffindor and\nfaster than lightning Severus's wand was in his hand and\n\"Quietus!\u202f\" silenced the offender.",
      "\"I will still demand discipline and respect in all my\nclasses,\" Severus said coldly, \"and anyone who trifles with me will\nregret it.\"",
      "He sat down.",
      "\"Thank you too!\" Headmaster Dumbledore said cheerfully. \"Carry\non!\"",
      "And Harry, still expressionless, began to walk back to his seat\nin Ravenclaw.",
      "There was an explosion of conversation. Two words were clearly\nidentifiable in the beginning. The first was an initial \"What -\"\nbeginning many different sentences such as \"What just happened -\"\nand \"What the hell -\" The second was \"Scourgify!\u202f\" as\nstudents cleaned up the dropped food and spit-out drinks from\nthemselves, the tablecloth, and each other.",

      "The last session of classes on Friday was about to start, in\nthat vast auditorium where all four Houses learned Defense, er,\nBattle Magic.",
      "The last session of classes on Friday.",
      "Harry was hoping that this class would be non-stressful, and\nthat the brilliant Professor Quirrell would realize this was\nperhaps not the best time to single out Harry for anything. Harry\nhad recovered a little, but...",
      "...but just in case, it was probably best to get in a bit of\nstress relief first.",
      "Harry leaned back in his chair and bestowed a look of great\nsolemnity upon Draco and his minions.",
      "\"You ask, what is our aim?\" Harry declaimed. \"I can answer in\none word. It is victory. Victory at all costs - Victory in spite of\nall terrors - Victory, however long and hard the road may be, for\nwithout victory there is no -\"",
      "\"Talk about Snape,\" Draco hissed. \"What did you\ndo?\u202f\"",
      "Harry wiped away the fake solemnity and gave Draco a more\nserious look.",
      "\"You saw it,\" Harry said. \"Everyone saw it. I snapped my\nfingers.\"",
      "\"Harry! Stop teasing me!\u202f\"",
      "So he'd been promoted to Harry now. Interesting. And in\nfact Harry was fairly sure that he was meant to notice that, and\nfeel bad if he didn't respond somehow...",
      "Harry tapped his ears and gave a significant glance at the\nminions.",
      "\"They won't talk,\" said Draco.",
      "\"Draco,\" Harry said, \"I'm going to be one hundred percent honest\nhere and say that yesterday I was not particularly impressed with\nMr. Goyle's cunning.\"",
      "Mr. Goyle winced.",
      "\"Me neither,\" said Draco. \"I explained to him that I ended up\nowing you a favor because of it.\" (Mr. Goyle winced again.) \"But\nthere is a big difference between that sort of mistake and\nbeing indiscreet. That really is something they've been trained\nfrom childhood to understand.\"",
      "\"All right then,\" Harry said. He lowered his voice, even though\nthe background noises had gone to blurs in Draco's presence. \"I\ndeduced one of Severus's secrets and did a bit of blackmail.\"",
      "Draco's expression hardened. \"Good, now tell me something you\ndidn't tell in strict confidence to the idiots in Gryffindor,\nmeaning that was the story you wanted to get all over the\nschool.\"",
      "Harry grinned involuntarily and he knew that Draco had caught\nit.",
      "\"What is Severus saying?\" Harry said.",
      "\"That he hadn't realized how sensitive the feelings of young\nchildren were,\" Draco said. \"Even in Slytherin! Even to\nme!\u202f\"",
      "\"Are you sure,\" Harry said, \"that you want to know something\nyour Head of House would rather you not know?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Draco said without hesitation.",
      "Interesting. \"Then you really are going to send your\nminions away first, because I'm not sure I can believe everything\nyou believe about them.\"",
      "Draco nodded. \"Okay.\"",
      "Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle looked very unhappy. \"Boss -\"\nsaid Mr. Crabbe.",
      "\"You've given Mr. Potter no reason to trust you,\" Draco said.\n\"Go!\"",
      "They left.",
      "\"In particular,\" Harry said, lowering his voice even further,\n\"I'm not entirely sure that they wouldn't just report what\nI said to Lucius.\"",
      "\"Father wouldn't do that!\" Draco said, looking\ngenuinely aghast. \"They're mine!\u202f\"",
      "\"I'm sorry, Draco,\" Harry said. \"I'm just not sure I can believe\neverything you believe about your father. Imagine it was your\nsecret and me telling you my father wouldn't do that.\"",
      "Draco nodded slowly. \"You're right. I'm sorry, Harry.\nIt was wrong of me to ask it of you.\"",
      "How did I get this promoted? Shouldn't he hate me\nnow? Harry had the feeling he was looking at something\nexploitable... he just wished his brain wasn't so exhausted.\nOrdinarily he would have loved to try his hand at some complicated\nplotting.",
      "\"Anyway,\" Harry said. \"Trade. I tell you a fact that isn't on\nthe grapevine, and does not go on the grapevine, and in\nparticular does not go to your father, and in return you\ntell me what you and Slytherin think about the whole business.\"",
      "\"Deal!\"",
      "Now to make this as vague as possible... something that wouldn't\nhurt much even if it did get out... \"What I said was true. I did\ndiscover one of Severus's secrets, and I did do some blackmail. But\nSeverus wasn't the only person involved.\"",
      "\"I knew it!\u202f\" Draco said exultantly.",
      "Harry's stomach sank. He had apparently said something very\nsignificant and he did not know why. This was not a good sign.",
      "\"All right,\" Draco said. He was grinning widely now. \"So here's\nwhat the reaction was like in Slytherin. First, all the idiots were\nlike, 'We hate Harry Potter! Let's go beat him up!'\"",
      "Harry choked. \"What is wrong with the Sorting Hat?\nThat's not Slytherin, it's Gryffindor -\"",
      "\"Not all children are prodigies,\" Draco said, though he was\nsmiling in a sort of nasty-conspiratorial way, as though to suggest\nthat he privately agreed with Harry's opinion. \"And it took around\nfifteen seconds for someone to explain to them why this might not\nbe such a favor to Snape, so you're fine. Anyway, after that was\nthe second wave of idiots, the ones who were saying, 'Looks like\nHarry Potter was just another do-gooder after all.'\"",
      "\"And then?\" Harry said, smiling even though he had no idea why\nthat was stupid.",
      "\"And then the actual smart people started talking. It's obvious\nthat you found a way to put a lot of pressure on Snape.\nAnd while that could be more than one thing... the obvious\nnext thought is that it has something to do with Snape's\nunknown hold over Dumbledore. Am I right?\"",
      "\"No comment,\" Harry said. At least his brain was processing this\npart correctly. House Slytherin had wondered why Severus\nwasn't getting fired. And they'd concluded that Severus was\nblackmailing Dumbledore. Could that actually be true...? But\nDumbledore hadn't seemed to act like it...",
      "Draco went on talking. \"And the next thing the smart\npeople pointed out was that if you could put enough pressure on\nSnape to make him leave half of Hogwarts alone, that meant you\nprobably had enough power to get rid of him entirely, if you\nwanted. What you did to him was a humiliation, just the same way he\ntried to humiliate you - but you left us our Head of House.\"",
      "Harry made his smile wider.",
      "\"And then the really smart people,\" Draco said, his\nface now serious, \"went off and had a little discussion by\nthemselves, and someone pointed out that it would be a very stupid\nthing to leave an enemy around like that. If you could break his\nhold over Dumbledore, the obvious thing would be to just do it.\nDumbledore would kick Snape out of Hogwarts and maybe even have him\nkilled, he'd be very grateful to you, and you wouldn't\nhave to worry about Snape sneaking into your dorm room at night\nwith interesting potions.\"",
      "Harry's face was now neutral. He had not thought of that and he\nreally, really should have. \"And from this you concluded...?\"",
      "\"Snape's hold was some secret of Dumbledore's and you've got\nthe secret!\u202f\" Draco was looking exultant. \"It can't be\npowerful enough to destroy Dumbledore entirely, or Snape would have\nused it by now. Snape refuses to use his hold for anything except\nstaying king of Slytherin House in Hogwarts, and he doesn't always\nget what he wants even then, so it must have limits. But it's\ngot to be really good! Father's been trying to get Snape\nto tell him for years!\u202f\"",
      "\"And,\" Harry said, \"now Lucius thinks maybe I can tell\nhim. Did you already get an owl -\"",
      "\"I will tonight,\" Draco said, and laughed. \"It will say,\" his\nvoice took on a different, more formal cadence, \"My beloved\nson: I've already told you of Harry Potter's potential importance.\nAs you have already realized, his importance has now become greater\nand more urgent. If you see any possible avenue of friendship or\npoint of pressure with him, you must pursue it, and the full\nresources of Malfoy are at your disposal if needed.\"",
      "Gosh. \"Well,\" Harry said, \"not commenting on whether or not your\nwhole complicated edifice of theory is true, let me just say that\nwe are not quite such good friends as yet.\"",
      "\"I know,\" Draco said. Then his face turned very\nserious, and his voice grew quiet even within the blur. \"Harry, has\nit occurred to you that if you know something Dumbledore doesn't\nwant known, Dumbledore might simply have you killed? And it would\nturn the Boy-Who-Lived from a potential competing leader into a\nvaluable martyr, too.\"",
      "\"No comment,\" Harry said yet again. He hadn't thought of that\nlast part, either. Didn't seem to be Dumbledore's style...\nbut...",
      "\"Harry,\" Draco said, \"you've obviously got incredible\ntalent, but you've got no training and no mentors and you do stupid\nthings sometimes and you really need an advisor who knows how\nto do this or you're going to get hurt!\u202f\" Draco's face was\nfierce.",
      "\"Ah,\" Harry said. \"An advisor like Lucius?\"",
      "\"Like me!\u202f\" said Draco. \"I'll promise to keep your\nsecrets from Father, from everyone, I'll just help you\nfigure out whatever you want to do!\"",
      "Wow.",
      "Harry saw that zombie-Quirrell was staggering in through the\ndoors.",
      "\"Class is about to start,\" said Harry. \"I'll think about what\nyou said, there's lots of times I do wish I had all your\ntraining, it's just I don't know how I can trust you so quickly\n-\"",
      "\"You shouldn't,\" Draco said, \"it's too soon. See? I'll give you\ngood advice even if it hurts me. But we should maybe hurry\nup and become closer friends.\"",
      "\"I'm open to that,\" said Harry, who was already trying to figure\nout how to exploit it.",
      "\"Another bit of advice,\" Draco said hurriedly as Quirrell\nslouched toward his desk, \"right now everyone in Slytherin's\nwondering about you, so if you're courting us, which I think you\nare, you should do something that signals friendship to Slytherin.\nSoon, like today or tomorrow.\"",
      "\"Letting Severus go on awarding extra House points to Slytherin\nwasn't enough?\" No reason Harry couldn't take credit for it.",
      "Draco's eyes flickered with realization, then he said rapidly,\n\"It's not the same, trust me, it's got to be something obvious.\nPush your mudblood rival Granger into a wall or something, everyone\nin Slytherin will know what that means -\"",
      "\"That is not how it works in Ravenclaw, Draco! If you\nhave to push someone into a wall it means your brain is too\nweak to beat them the right way and everyone in Ravenclaw\nknows that -\"",
      "The screen on Harry's desk flickered on, provoking a sudden wash\nof nostalgia for television and computers.",
      "\"Ahem,\" said Professor Quirrell's voice, seeming to speak\npersonally to Harry out of the screen. \"Please take your\nseats.\"",
      "And the children were all seated and staring at the repeater\nscreens on their desks, or looking down directly at the great white\nmarble stage where Professor Quirrell stood, leaning on his desk\natop the small dais of darker marble.",
      "\"Today,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"I had planned to teach you\nyour first defensive spell, a small shield that was the ancestor of\ntoday's Protego. But on second thought I have changed\ntoday's lesson plan in the light of recent events.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell's gaze searched the rows of seats. Harry\nwinced from where he was sitting, in the back row. He had a feeling\nhe knew who was about to be called on.",
      "\"Draco, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy,\" said\nProfessor Quirrell.",
      "Whew.",
      "\"Yes, Professor?\" said Draco. His voice was amplified, seeming\nto come from the repeater screen on Harry's desk, which showed\nDraco's face as he spoke. Then the screen shifted back to Professor\nQuirrell, who said:",
      "\"Is it your ambition to become the next Dark Lord?\"",
      "\"That's an odd question, Professor,\" said Draco. \"I mean, who'd\nbe dumb enough to admit it?\"",
      "A few students laughed, but not many.",
      "\"Indeed,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"So while there's no point in\nasking any of you, it would not surprise me in the slightest if\nthere were a student or two in my classes who harbored ambitions of\nbeing the next Dark Lord. After all, I wanted to be the\nnext Dark Lord when I was a young Slytherin.\"",
      "This time the laughter was much more widespread.",
      "\"Well, it is the House of the ambitious, after all,\"\nProfessor Quirrell said, smiling. \"I didn't realize until later\nthat what I really enjoyed was Battle Magic, and that my true\nambition was to become a great fighting wizard and someday teach at\nHogwarts. In any case, when I was thirteen years old, I read\nthrough the historical sections of the Hogwarts library,\nscrutinizing the lives and fates of past Dark Lords, and I made a\nlist of all the mistakes that I would never make when\nI was a Dark Lord -\"",
      "Harry giggled before he could stop himself.",
      "\"Yes, Mr. Potter, very amusing. So, Mr. Potter, can you guess\nwhat was the very first item on that list?\"",
      "Great. \"Um... never use a complicated way of dealing\nwith an enemy when you can just Abracadabra them?\"",
      "\"The term, Mr. Potter, is Avada Kedavra,\"\nProfessor Quirrell's voice sounded a bit sharp for some reason,\n\"and no, that was not on the list I made at age thirteen.\nWould you care to guess again?\"",
      "\"Ah... never brag to anyone about your evil master plan?\"",
      "Professor Quirrell laughed. \"Ah, now that was number\ntwo. My, Mr. Potter, have we been reading the same books?\"",
      "There was more laughter, with an undertone of nervousness. Harry\nclenched his jaw tightly shut and said nothing. A denial would\naccomplish nothing.",
      "\"But no. The first item was, 'I will not go around\nprovoking strong, vicious enemies.' The history of the world would\nbe very different if Mornelithe Falconsbane or Hitler had grasped\nthat elementary point. Now if, Mr. Potter - just\nif by some chance you harbor an ambition similar to the\none I held as a young Slytherin - even so, I hope it is not your\nambition to become a stupid Dark Lord.\"",
      "\"Professor Quirrell,\" Harry said, gritting his teeth, \"I am a\nRavenclaw and it is not my ambition to be stupid, period.\nI know that what I did today was dumb. But it wasn't Dark!\nI was not the one who threw the first punch in that\nfight!\"",
      "\"You, Mr. Potter, are an idiot. But then so was I at your age.\nThus I anticipated your answer and altered today's lesson plan\naccordingly. Mr. Gregory Goyle, if you would come forward,\nplease?\"",
      "There was a surprised pause in the classroom. Harry hadn't been\nexpecting that.",
      "Neither, from the looks of it, had Mr. Goyle, who looked rather\nuncertain and worried as he mounted the marble stage and approached\nthe dais.",
      "Professor Quirrell straightened from where he was leaning on the\ndesk. He looked suddenly stronger, and his hands formed fists and\nhe drew himself up into a clearly recognizable martial arts\nstance.",
      "Harry's eyes widened at the sight, and he realized why Mr. Goyle\nhad been called up.",
      "\"Most wizards,\" Professor Quirrell said, \"do not bother much\nwith what a Muggle would term martial arts. Is not a wand stronger\nthan a fist? This attitude is stupid. Wands are held in fists. If\nyou want to be a great fighting wizard you must learn\nmartial arts to a level which would impress even a Muggle. I will\nnow demonstrate a certain vitally important technique, which I\nlearned in a dojo, a Muggle school of martial arts, of\nwhich I shall speak more shortly. For now...\" Professor Quirrell\ntook several steps forward, still in stance, advancing on where Mr.\nGoyle stood. \"Mr. Goyle, I will ask you to attack me.\"",
      "\"Professor Quirrell,\" said Mr. Goyle, his voice now amplified as\nthe professor's was, \"can I ask what level -\"",
      "\"Sixth dan. You will not be hurt and neither will I.\nAnd if you see an opening, please take it.\"",
      "Mr. Goyle nodded, looking much relieved.",
      "\"Note,\" Professor Quirrell said, \"that Mr. Goyle was afraid to\nattack someone who did not know martial arts to an acceptable\nlevel, for fear that I, or he, would be hurt. Mr. Goyle's attitude\nis exactly correct and he has earned three Quirrell points for it.\nNow, fight!\"",
      "The young boy blurred forward, fists flying, and the Professor\nblocked every blow, dancing backward, Quirrell kicked and Goyle\nblocked and spun and tried to trip Quirrell with a sweeping leg and\nQuirrell hopped over it and it was all happening too fast for Harry\nto make sense of what was going on and then Goyle was on his back\nwith his legs pushing and Quirrell was actually flying through\nthe air and then he hit the ground shoulder first and\nrolled.",
      "\"Stop!\" cried Professor Quirrell from the ground, sounding a\nlittle panicked. \"You win!\"",
      "Mr. Goyle pulled up so sharply he staggered, almost tripping and\nfalling from the aborted momentum of his headlong charge toward\nProfessor Quirrell. His face showed utter shock.",
      "Professor Quirrell arched his back and bounced to his feet using\na peculiar springing motion that made no use of his hands.",
      "There was a silence in the classroom, a silence born of total\nconfusion.",
      "\"Mr. Goyle,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"what vitally important\ntechnique did I demonstrate?\"",
      "\"How to fall correctly when someone throws you,\" said Mr. Goyle.\n\"It's one of the very first lessons you learn -\"",
      "\"That too,\" said Professor Quirrell.",
      "There was a pause.",
      "\"The vitally important technique which I demonstrated,\" said\nProfessor Quirrell, \"was how to lose. You may go, Mr. Goyle, thank\nyou.\"",
      "Mr. Goyle walked off the platform, looking rather bewildered.\nHarry felt the same way.",
      "Professor Quirrell walked back to his desk and resumed leaning\non it. \"Sometimes we forget the most basic things, since it has\nbeen too long since we learned them. I realized I had done the same\nwith my own lesson plan. You do not teach students to throw until\nyou have taught them to fall. And I must not teach you to fight if\nyou do not understand how to lose.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell's face hardened, and Harry thought he saw a\nhint of pain, a touch of sorrow, in those eyes. \"I learned how to\nlose in a dojo in Asia, which, as any Muggle knows, is\nwhere all the good martial artists live. This dojo taught\na style which had a reputation among fighting wizards as adapting\nwell to magical dueling. The Master of that dojo - an old\nman by Muggle standards - was that style's greatest living teacher.\nHe had no idea that magic existed, of course. I applied to study\nthere, and was one of the few students accepted that year, from\namong many contenders. There might have been a tiny bit of special\ninfluence involved.\"",
      "There was some laughter in the classroom. Harry didn't share it.\nThat hadn't been right at all.",
      "\"In any case. During one of my first fights, after I had been\nbeaten in a particularly humiliating fashion, I lost control and\nattacked my sparring partner -\"",
      "Yikes.",
      "\"- thankfully with my fists, rather than my magic. The Master,\nsurprisingly, did not expel me on the spot. But he told me that\nthere was a flaw in my temperament. He explained it to me, and I\nknew that he was right. And then he said that I would learn how to\nlose.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell's face was expressionless.",
      "\"Upon his strict orders, all of the students of the\ndojo lined up. One by one, they approached me. I was\nnot to defend myself. I was only to beg for mercy. One by\none, they slapped me, or punched me, and pushed me to the ground.\nSome of them spat on me. They called me awful names in their\nlanguage. And to each one, I had to say, 'I lose!' and similar such\nthings, such as 'I beg you to stop!' and 'I admit you're better\nthan me!'\"",
      "Harry was trying to imagine this and simply failing. There was\nno way something like that could have happened to the dignified\nProfessor Quirrell.",
      "\"I was a prodigy of Battle Magic even then. With wandless magic\nalone I could have killed everyone in that dojo. I did not do so. I\nlearned to lose. To this day I remember it as one of the most\nunpleasant hours of my life. And when I left that dojo eight months\nlater - which was not nearly enough time, but was all I could\nafford to spend - the Master told me that he hoped I understood why\nthat had been necessary. And I told him that it was one of the most\nvaluable lessons I had ever learned. Which was, and is, true.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell's face turned bitter. \"You are wondering\nwhere this marvelous dojo is, and whether you can study\nthere. You cannot. For not long afterward, another would-be student\ncame to that hidden place, to that remote mountain.\nHe-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.\"",
      "There was the sound of many breaths being drawn in\nsimultaneously. Harry felt sick to his stomach. He knew what was\ncoming.",
      "\"The Dark Lord came to that school openly, without disguise,\nglowing red eyes and all. The students tried to bar his way and he\nsimply Apparated through. There was terror there, but discipline,\nand the Master came forth. And the Dark Lord demanded - not asked,\nbut demanded - to be taught.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell's face was very hard. \"Perhaps the Master had\nread too many books telling the lie that a true martial artist\ncould defeat even demons. For whatever reason, the Master refused.\nThe Dark Lord asked why he could not be a student. The Master told\nhim he had no patience, and that was when the Dark Lord ripped his\ntongue out.\"",
      "There was a collective gasp.",
      "\"You can guess what happened next. The students tried to rush\nthe Dark Lord and fell over, stunned where they stood. And\nthen...\"",
      "Professor Quirrell's voice faltered for a moment, then\nresumed.",
      "\"There is an Unforgiveable Curse, the Cruciatus Curse, which\nproduces unbearable pain. If the Cruciatus is extended for longer\nthan a few minutes it produces permanent insanity. One by one, the\nDark Lord Crucioed the Master's students into insanity, and then\nfinished them off with the Killing Curse, while the Master was\nforced to watch. When all his students had died in this way, the\nMaster followed. I learned this from the single surviving student,\nwhom the Dark Lord had left alive to tell the tale, and who had\nbeen a friend of mine...\"",
      "Professor Quirrell turned away, and when he turned back a moment\nlater, he once again seemed calm and composed.",
      "\"Dark Wizards cannot keep their tempers,\" Professor Quirrell\nsaid quietly. \"It is a nearly universal flaw of the species, and\nanyone who makes a habit of fighting them soon learns to rely on\nit. Understand that the Dark Lord did not win that day.\nHis goal was to learn martial arts, and yet he left without a\nsingle lesson. The Dark Lord was foolish to wish that story retold.\nIt did not show his strength, but rather an exploitable\nweakness.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell's gaze focused on a single child in the\nclassroom.",
      "\"Harry Potter,\" Professor Quirrell said.",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry said, his voice hoarse.",
      "\"What precisely did you do wrong today, Mr.\nPotter?\"",
      "Harry felt like he was going to throw up. \"I lost my\ntemper.\"",
      "\"That is not precise,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"I will\ndescribe it more exactly. There are many animals which have what\nare called dominance contests. They rush at each other with horns -\ntrying to knock each other down, not gore each other. They fight\nwith their paws - with claws sheathed. But why with their claws\nsheathed? Surely, if they used their claws, they would stand a\nbetter chance of winning? But then their enemy might unsheathe\ntheir claws as well, and instead of resolving the dominance contest\nwith a winner and a loser, both of them might be severely\nhurt.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell gaze seemed to come straight out at Harry\nfrom the repeater screen. \"What you demonstrated today, Mr. Potter,\nis that - unlike those animals who keep their claws sheathed and\naccept the results - you do not know how to lose a dominance\ncontest. When a Hogwarts professor challenged you, you did\nnot back down. When it looked like you might lose, you unsheathed\nyour claws, heedless of the danger. You escalated, and\nthen you escalated again. It started with a slap at you\nfrom Professor Snape, who was obviously dominant over you. Instead\nof losing, you slapped back and lost ten points from Ravenclaw.\nSoon you were talking about leaving Hogwarts. The fact that you\nescalated even further in some unknown direction, and somehow won\nat the end, does not change the fact that you are an idiot.\"",
      "\"I understand,\" Harry said. His throat was dry. That\nhad been precise. Frighteningly precise. Now that\nProfessor Quirrell had said it, Harry could see in hindsight that\nit was an exactly accurate description of what had\nhappened. When someone's model of you was that good, you had to\nwonder whether they were right about other things too, like your\nintent to kill.",
      "\"The next time, Mr. Potter, that you choose to escalate\na contest rather than lose, you may lose all the stakes\nyou place on the table. I cannot guess what they were today. I can\nguess that they were far, far too high for the loss of ten House\npoints.\"",
      "Like the fate of magical Britain. That was what he'd done.",
      "''You will protest that you were trying to help all of Hogwarts,\na much more important goal worthy of great risks. That is a\nlie. If you had been -\"",
      "\"I would have taken the slap, waited, and picked the best\npossible time to make my move,\" Harry said, his voice hoarse. \"But\nthat would have meant losing. Letting him be dominant over\nme. It was what the Dark Lord couldn't do with the Master he wanted\nto learn from.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell nodded. \"I see that you have understood\nperfectly. And so, Mr. Potter, today you are going to learn how to\nlose.\"",
      "\"I -\"",
      "\"I will not hear any objections, Mr. Potter. It is evident both\nthat you need this and that you are strong enough to take it. I\nassure you that your experience will not be so harsh as what I went\nthrough, though you may well remember it as the worst fifteen\nminutes of your young life.\"",
      "Harry swallowed. \"Professor Quirrell,\" he said in a small voice,\n\"can we do this some other time?\"",
      "\"No,\" Professor Quirrell said simply. \"You are five days into\nyour Hogwarts education and already this has happened. Today is\nFriday. Our next defense class is on Wednesday. Saturday,\nSunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday... No, we do not have\ntime to wait.\"",
      "There were a few laughs at this, but very few.",
      "\"Please consider it an order from your professor, Mr. Potter.\nWhat I would like to say is that otherwise I will not teach you any\noffensive spells, because I would then hear that you had severely\nhurt or even killed someone. Unfortunately I am told that your\nfingers are already powerful weapons. Do not snap them at any time\nduring this lesson.\"",
      "More scattered laughter, sounding rather nervous.",
      "Harry felt like he might cry. \"Professor Quirrell, if you do\nanything like what you talked about, it's going to make me angry,\nand I really would rather not get angry again today -\"",
      "\"The point is not to avoid getting angry,\" Professor\nQuirrell said, his face looking grave. \"Anger is natural. You need\nto learn how to lose even when you are angry. Or at least\npretend to lose so that you can plan your\nvengeance. As I did with Mr. Goyle today, unless of course any of\nyou think he really is better -\"",
      "\"I'm not!\" shouted Mr. Goyle from his desk, sounding a little\nfrantic. \"I know you didn't really lose! Please don't plan any\nvengeances!\"",
      "Harry felt sick to his stomach. Professor Quirrell didn't know\nabout his mysterious dark side. \"Professor, we really need to talk\nabout this after class -\"",
      "\"We will,\" Professor Quirrell said in the tones of a promise.\n\"After you learn how to lose.\" His face was serious. \"It should go\nwithout saying that I will exclude anything which could injure you\nor even cause you significant pain. The pain will come from the\ndifficulty of losing, instead of fighting back and escalating the\nbattle until you win.\"",
      "Harry's breath was coming in short, panicky pants. He was more\nfrightened than he'd been after leaving the Potions classroom.\n\"Professor Quirrell,\" he managed to say, \"I don't want you to get\nfired over this -\"",
      "\"I will not be,\" Professor Quirrell said, \"if you tell\nthem afterward that it was necessary. And this I trust you to do.\"\nFor a moment Professor Quirrell's voice turned very dry. \"Believe\nme, they have tolerated worse in their hallways. This case will be\nexceptional only in that it happens within a classroom.\"",
      "\"Professor Quirrell,\" Harry whispered, but he thought his voice\nwas still being repeated everywhere, \"do you really believe that if\nI don't do this, I might hurt someone?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Professor Quirrell said simply.",
      "\"Then,\" Harry felt nauseous, \"I'll do it.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell turned to regard the Slytherins. \"So... with\nthe full approval of your teacher, and in such a fashion that Snape\ncannot be blamed for your actions... do any of you wish to show\nyour dominance over the Boy-Who-Lived? Shove him around, push him\nto the ground, hear him beg for your mercy?\"",
      "Five hands went up.",
      "\"Everyone with your hand raised, you are an absolute idiot. What\npart of pretending to lose did you not understand? If\nHarry Potter does become the next Dark Lord he will hunt you down\nand kill you after he graduates.\"",
      "The five hands dropped abruptly back to their desks.",
      "\"I won't,\" Harry said, his voice coming out rather weakly. \"I\nswear never to take vengeance upon those who help me learn to lose.\nProfessor Quirrell... would you please... stop\nthat?\"",
      "Professor Quirrell sighed. \"I am sorry, Mr. Potter. I\nrealize that you must find this equally annoying whether you intend\nto become a Dark Lord or not. But those children also had\nan important life lesson to learn. Would it be acceptable if I\nawarded you a Quirrell point in apology?\"",
      "\"Make it two,\" Harry said.",
      "There was a current of surprised laughter, defusing some of the\ntension.",
      "\"Done,\" Professor Quirrell said.",
      "\"And after I graduate I'm going to hunt you down and\ntickle you.\"",
      "There was more laughter, although Professor Quirrell didn't\nsmile.",
      "Harry felt like he was wrestling an anaconda, trying to force\nthe conversation through the narrow course that would make people\nrealize he wasn't a Dark Lord after all... why was\nProfessor Quirrell so suspicious of him?",
      "\"Professor,\" said Draco's unamplified voice. \"It is also not my\nown ambition to become a stupid Dark Lord.\"",
      "There was a shocked silence in the classroom.",
      "You don't have to do this! Harry almost blurted out\nloud, but checked himself in time; Draco might not wish it known\nthat he was doing this out of friendship for Harry... or out of the\ndesire to appear friendly...",
      "Calling that a desire to appear friendly made\nHarry feel small, and mean. If Draco had intended to impress him,\nit was working perfectly.",
      "Professor Quirrell was regarding Draco gravely. \"You\nworry that you cannot pretend to lose, Mr. Malfoy? That this flaw\nwhich describes Mr. Potter also describes you? Surely your\nfather taught you better.\"",
      "\"When it comes to talking, maybe,\" said Draco, now on the\nrepeater screen. \"Not when it comes to being shoved around and\npushed to the ground. I want to be fully as strong as you,\nProfessor Quirrell.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell's eyebrows went up and stayed up. \"I am\nafraid, Mr. Malfoy,\" he said after a time, \"that the arrangements I\nmade for Mr. Potter, involving some older Slytherins who will be\ntold afterward how stupid they were, would not carry over\nonto you. But it is my professional opinion that you are already\nvery strong. Should I hear that you have failed, as Mr. Potter\nfailed today, I will make the appropriate arrangements and\napologize to you and whomever you have hurt. I do not think this\nwill be necessary, however.\"",
      "\"I understand, professor,\" said Draco.",
      "Professor Quirrell looked over the class. \"Does anyone else wish\nto become strong?\"",
      "Some students glanced around nervously. Some, Harry thought from\nhis back row, looked like they were opening their mouths but not\nsaying anything. In the end, no one spoke.",
      "\"Draco Malfoy will be one of the generals of your year's\narmies,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"should he deign to engage in\nthat after-school activity. And now, Mr. Potter, please come\nforward.\"",
      "Yes, Professor Quirrell had said, it must be in\nfront of everyone, in front of your friends, because that is where\nSnape confronted you and that is where you must learn to\nlose.",
      "So now the first year watched. In magically enforced silence,\nand with requests from both Harry and the professor not to\nintervene. Hermione had her face turned away, but she hadn't spoken\nout or even given him any sort of significant look, maybe because\nshe'd been there in Potions too.",
      "Harry stood on a soft blue mat, such as might be found in a\nMuggle dojo, which Professor Quirrell had laid out upon the floor\nfor when Harry was pushed down.",
      "Harry was frightened of what he might do. If Professor Quirrell\nwas right about his intent to kill...",
      "Harry's wand lay on Professor Quirrell's desk, not because Harry\nknew any spells that could defend him, but because otherwise (Harry\nthought) he might have tried to jam it through someone's eye\nsocket. His pouch lay there, now containing his protected but still\npotentially fragile Time-Turner.",
      "Harry had pleaded with Professor Quirrell to Transfigure him\nsome boxing gloves and lock them on his hands. Professor Quirrell\nhad given him a look of silent understanding, and refused.",
      "I will not go for their eyes, I will not go for their eyes,\nI will not go for their eyes, it would be the end of my life in\nHogwarts, I'll be arrested, Harry chanted to himself, trying\nto hammer the thought into his brain, hoping it would stay there if\nhis intent to kill took over.",
      "Professor Quirrell returned, escorting thirteen older Slytherins\nof different years. Harry recognized one of them as the one he'd\nhit with a pie. Two others from that confrontation were also\npresent. The one who'd said to stop, that they really shouldn't do\nthis, was missing.",
      "\"I repeat,\" Professor Quirrell said, sounding very stern,\n\"Potter is not to be really hurt. Any and all\naccidents will be treated as deliberate. Do you\nunderstand?\"",
      "The older Slytherins nodded, grinning.",
      "\"Then please feel free to take the Boy-Who-Lived down a few\npegs,\" Professor Quirrell said, with a twisted smile that only the\nfirst-years understood.",
      "By some form of mutual consent, the pie-target was at the front\nof the group.",
      "\"Potter,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"meet Mr. Peregrine Derrick.\nHe is better than you and he is about to show you that.\"",
      "Derrick strode forward and Harry's brain screamed discordantly,\nhe must not run away, he must not fight back -",
      "Derrick stopped an arm's length away from Harry.",
      "Harry wasn't angry yet, just frightened. And that meant he\nbeheld a teenage boy fully half a meter taller than himself, with\nclearly defined muscles, facial hair, and a grin of terrible\nanticipation.",
      "\"Ask him not to hurt you,\" Professor Quirrell said. \"Perhaps if\nhe sees that you're pathetic enough, he'll decide that you're\nboring, and go away.\"",
      "There was laughter from the watching older Slytherins.",
      "\"Please,\" Harry said, his voice faltering, \"don't, hurt,\nme...\"",
      "\"That didn't sound very sincere,\" said Professor Quirrell.",
      "Derrick's smile widened. The clumsy imbecile was looking very\nsuperior and...",
      "...Harry's blood temperature was dropping...",
      "\"Please don't hurt me,\" Harry tried again.",
      "Professor Quirrell shook his head. \"How in Merlin's name did you\nmanage to make that sound like an insult, Potter? There is only one\nresponse you can possibly expect from Mr. Derrick.\"",
      "Derrick stepped forward deliberately, and bumped into Harry.",
      "Harry staggered back a few feet and, before he could stop\nhimself, straightened up icily.",
      "\"Wrong,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"wrong, wrong, wrong.\"",
      "\"You bumped into me, Potter,\" Derrick said. \"Apologize.\"",
      "\"I'm sorry!\"",
      "\"You don't sound sorry,\" said Derrick.",
      "Harry's eyes widened in indignation, he had managed to\nmake that sound pleading -",
      "Derrick pushed him, hard, and Harry fell to the mat on his hands\nand knees.",
      "The blue fabric seemed to waver in Harry's vision, not far\naway.",
      "He was beginning to doubt Professor Quirrell's real motives in\nteaching this so-called lesson.",
      "A foot rested on Harry's buttocks and a moment later Harry was\npushed hard to the side, sending him sprawling on his back.",
      "Derrick laughed. \"This is fun,\" he said.",
      "All he had to do was say it was over. And report the whole thing\nto the Headmaster's office. That would be the end of this\nDefense Professor and his ill-fated stay at Hogwarts\nand... Professor McGonagall would be angry about that, but...",
      "(An image of Professor McGonagall's face flashed before his\neyes, she didn't look angry, just sad -)",
      "\"Now tell him that he's better than you, Potter,\" said Professor\nQuirrell's voice.",
      "\"You're, better, than, me.\"",
      "Harry started to raise himself and Derrick put a foot on his\nchest and shoved him back down to the mat.",
      "The world was becoming transparent as crystal. Lines of action\nand their consequences stretched out before him in utter clarity.\nThe fool wouldn't be expecting him to strike back, a quick hit in\nthe groin would stun him long enough for -",
      "\"Try again,\" said Professor Quirrell and with a sudden sharp\nmotion Harry rolled and sprang to his feet and whirled on where\nstood his real enemy, the Defense Professor -",
      "Professor Quirrell said, \"You have no patience.\"",
      "Harry faltered. His mind, well-honed in pessimism, drew a\npicture of a wizened old man with blood pouring from his mouth\nafter Harry had ripped his tongue out -",
      "A moment later, Derrick pushed Harry to the mat again and then\nsat down on him, sending Harry's breath whooshing out.",
      "\"Stop!\" Harry screamed. \"Please stop!\"",
      "\"Better,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"That even sounded\nsincere.\"",
      "It had been. That was the horrible thing, the sickening\nthing, it had been sincere. Harry was panting rapidly,\nfear and cold anger both flushing through him -",
      "\"Lose,\" said Professor Quirrell.",
      "\"I, lose,\" Harry forced out.",
      "\"I like it,\" Derrick said from on top of him. \"Lose some\nmore.\"",
      "Hands shoved Harry, sending him stumbling across the circle of\nolder Slytherins to another set of hands that shoved him again.\nHarry had long since passed the point of trying not to cry, and was\nnow just trying not to fall down.",
      "\"What are you, Potter?\" said Derrick.",
      "\"A, l-loser, I lose, I give up, you win, you're b-better, than\nme, please stop -\"",
      "Harry tripped over a foot and went crashing to the ground, hands\nnot quite able to catch himself. He was dazed for a moment, then\nbegan struggling to his feet again -",
      "\"Enough!\u202f\" said Professor Quirrell's voice, sounding\nsharp enough to cut iron. \"Step away from Mr. Potter!\"",
      "Harry saw the surprised looks on their faces. The chill in his\nblood, which had been flowing and ebbing, smiled in cold\nsatisfaction.",
      "Then Harry collapsed to the mat.",
      "Professor Quirrell talked. There were gasps from the older\nSlytherins.",
      "\"And I believe the scion of Malfoy has something he wants to\nexplain to you as well,\" finished Professor Quirrell.",
      "Draco's voice started talking. His voice sounded almost as sharp\nas professor Quirrell's, it had acquired the same cadence Draco had\nused to imitate his father, and it was saying things like could\nhave put Slytherin House in jeopardy and who knows how\nmany allies in this school alone and total lack of\nawareness, never mind cunning and dull thugs, useful for\nnothing but lackeys and something in Harry's hindbrain,\ndespite everything he knew, was designating Draco as an ally.",
      "Harry ached all over, was probably bruised, his body felt cold,\nhis mind utterly exhausted. He tried to think of Fawkes's song, but\nwithout the phoenix present he couldn't remember the melody and\nwhen he tried to imagine it he couldn't seem to think of anything\nexcept a bird chirping.",
      "Then Draco stopped talking and Professor Quirrell told the older\nSlytherins they were dismissed, and Harry opened his eyes and\nstruggled to sit up, \"Wait,\" Harry said, forcing the words out,\n\"there's something, I want, to say, to them -\"",
      "\"Wait on Mr. Potter,\" Professor Quirrell said coldly to the\ndeparting Slytherins.",
      "Harry swayed to his feet. He was careful not to look in the\ndirection of his classmates. He didn't want to see how they were\nlooking at him now. He didn't want to see their pity.",
      "So instead Harry looked at the older Slytherins, who still\nseemed to be in a state of shock. They stared back at him. Dread\nwas on their faces.",
      "His dark side, when it was in control, had held to the\nimagination of this moment, and went on pretending to lose.",
      "Harry said, \"No one will -\"",
      "\"Stop,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"If that's what I think it is,\nplease wait until after they're gone. They'll hear about it later.\nWe all have our lessons to learn, Mr. Potter.\"",
      "\"All right,\" Harry said.",
      "\"You. Go.\"",
      "The older Slytherins fled and the door closed behind them.",
      "\"No one's to take any revenge on them,\" Harry said hoarsely.\n\"That's a request to anyone who considers themselves my friend. I\nhad my lesson to learn, they helped me learn it, they had their\nlesson to learn too, it's over. If you tell this story, make sure\nyou tell that part too.\"",
      "Harry turned to look at Professor Quirrell.",
      "\"You lost,\" said Professor Quirrell, his voice gentle for the\nfirst time. It sounded strange coming from the professor, like his\nvoice shouldn't even be able to do that.",
      "Harry had lost. There had been moments when the cold\nanger had faded entirely, replaced by fear, and during those\nmoments he'd begged the older Slytherins and he'd meant it...",
      "\"And are you yet alive?\" said Professor Quirrell, still with\nthat strange gentleness.",
      "Harry managed to nod.",
      "\"Not all losing is like this,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"There\nare compromises and negotiated surrenders. There are other ways to\nplacate bullies. There is a whole art form to manipulating others\nby letting them be dominant over you. But first, losing must be\nthinkable. Will you remember how you lost?\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"Will you be able to lose?\"",
      "\"I... think so...\"",
      "\"I think so too.\" Professor Quirrell bowed so low that his thin\nhair almost touched the floor. \"Congratulations, Harry Potter, you\nwin.\"",
      "There was no single source, no first mover, the applause started\nall at once like a massive thunderclap.",
      "Harry's couldn't keep the shock from his face. He risked a\nglance at his classmates, and he saw their faces showing not pity\nbut awe. The applause was coming from Ravenclaw and Gryffindor and\nHufflepuff and even Slytherin, probably because Draco Malfoy was\napplauding too. Some students were standing up from their chairs\nand half of Gryffindor was standing on their desks.",
      "So Harry stood there, swaying, letting their respect wash over\nhim, feeling stronger, and maybe even a little healed.",
      "Professor Quirrell waited for the applause to die away. It took\nquite a while.",
      "\"Surprised, Mr. Potter?\" Professor Quirrell said. His voice\nsounded amused. \"You have just found out that the real world does\nnot always work like your worst nightmares. Yes, if you\nhad been some poor anonymous boy being abused, then they would\nprobably have respected you less afterward, pitied you even as they\ncomforted you from their loftier perches. That is human\nnature, I'm afraid. But you they already know for a figure\nof power. And they saw you confront your fear and keep confronting\nit, even though you could have walked away at any time. Did you\nthink less of me when I told you that I had deliberately\nendured being spat upon?\"",
      "Harry felt a burning sensation in his throat and frantically\nclamped down. He didn't trust this miraculous respect enough to\nstart crying again in front of it.",
      "\"Your extraordinary achievement in my class deserves an\nextraordinary reward, Harry Potter. Please accept it with my\ncompliments on behalf of my House, and remember from this day\nforward that not all Slytherins are alike. There are Slytherins,\nand then there are Slytherins.\" Professor Quirrell was smiling\nquite broadly as he said this. \"Fifty-one points to Ravenclaw.\"",
      "There was a shocked pause and then pandemonium broke out among\nthe Ravenclaw students, howling and whistling and cheering.",
      "(And in the same moment Harry felt something wrong\nabout that, Professor McGonagall had been right, there\nshould have been consequences, there should have been a\ncost and a price to be paid, you couldn't just put everything back\nthe way it was like that -)",
      "But Harry saw the elated faces in Ravenclaw and knew he couldn't\npossibly say no.",
      "His brain made a suggestion. It was a good suggestion. Harry\ncould not even believe his brain was still keeping him upright, let\nalone producing good suggestions.",
      "\"Professor Quirrell,\" Harry said, as clearly as he could through\nhis burning throat. \"You are everything a member of your House\nshould be, and I think you must be just what Salazar Slytherin had\nin mind when he helped found Hogwarts. I thank you and your House,\"\nDraco was very slightly nodding and subtly turning his finger,\nkeep going, \"and I think this calls for three cheers for\nSlytherin. With me, everyone?\" Harry paused. \"Huzzah!\u202f\"\nOnly a few people managed to join in on the first try.\n\"Huzzah!\u202f\" This time most of Ravenclaw was in on it.\n\"Huzzah!\u202f\" That was almost all of Ravenclaw, a scattering\nof Hufflepuffs and around a quarter of Gryffindor.",
      "Draco's hand moved into a small, quick, thumbs-up gesture.",
      "Most of the Slytherins had expressions of sheer shock. A few\nwere staring at Professor Quirrell in wonder. Blaise Zabini was\nlooking at Harry with a calculating, intrigued expression.",
      "Professor Quirrell bowed. \"Thank you, Harry Potter,\" he\nsaid, still with that broad smile. He turned to the class. \"Now,\nbelieve it or not, we still have half an hour left in this session,\nand that is enough to introduce the Simple Shield. Mr. Potter, of\ncourse, is going off and taking a well-earned rest.\"",
      "\"I can -\"",
      "\"Idiot,\" Professor Quirrell said fondly. The class was already\nlaughing. \"Your classmates can teach you afterward, or I'll tutor\nyou privately if that's what it takes. But right now,\nyou're going through the third door from the left in the back of\nthe stage, where you will find a bed, an assortment of\nexceptionally tasty snacks, and some extremely light reading from\nthe Hogwarts library. You may not take anything else with you,\nparticularly not your textbooks. Now go.\"",
      "Harry went."

      "That which can be destroyed by the Rowling should be.",
      "Harry stared up at the gray ceiling of the small room, from\nwhere he lay on the portable yet soft bed that had been placed\nthere. He'd eaten quite a lot of Professor Quirrell's snacks -\nintricate confections of chocolate and other substances, dusted\nwith sparkling sprinkles and jeweled with tiny sugar gems, looking\nhighly expensive and proving, in fact, to be quite tasty. Harry\nhadn't felt the least bit guilty about it either, this he\nhad earned.",
      "He hadn't tried to sleep. Harry had a feeling that he wouldn't\nlike what happened when he closed his eyes.",
      "He hadn't tried to read. He wouldn't have been able to\nfocus.",
      "Funny how Harry's brain just seemed to keep on running and\nrunning, never shutting down no matter how tired it got. It got\nstupider but it refused to switch off.",
      "But there was, there really and truly was a feeling of\ntriumph.",
      "Anti-Dark-Lord-Harry program, +1 point didn't begin to\ncover it. Harry wondered what the Sorting Hat would say\nnow, if he could put it on his head.",
      "No wonder Professor Quirrell had accused Harry of\nheading down the path of a Dark Lord. Harry had been too slow on\nthe uptake, he should have seen the parallel right away -",
      "Understand that the Dark Lord did not win that day. His goal\nwas to learn martial arts, and yet he left without a single\nlesson.",
      "Harry had entered the Potions class with the intent to learn\nPotions. He'd left without a single lesson.",
      "And Professor Quirrell had heard, and understood with\nfrightening precision, and reached out and yanked Harry off that\npath, the path that led to his becoming a copy of You-Know-Who.",
      "There was a knock at the door. \"Classes are over,\" said\nProfessor Quirrell's quiet voice.",
      "Harry approached the door and found himself suddenly nervous.\nThen the tension diminished as he heard Professor Quirrell's\nfootsteps moving away from the door.",
      "What on Earth is that about? Is it what's going to get him\nfired eventually?",
      "Harry opened the door, and saw that Professor Quirrell was now\nwaiting several bodylengths away.",
      "Does Professor Quirrell feel it too?",
      "They walked across the now-deserted stage to Professor\nQuirrell's desk, which Professor Quirrell leaned on; and Harry, as\nbefore, stopped short of the dais.",
      "\"So,\" Professor Quirrell said. There was a friendly sense about\nhim somehow, even though his face still kept its usual seriousness.\n\"What was it you wanted to talk to me about, Mr. Potter?\"",
      "I have a mysterious dark side. But Harry couldn't just\nblurt it out like that.",
      "\"Professor Quirrell,\" Harry said, \"am I off the path to becoming\na Dark Lord, now?\"",
      "Professor Quirrell looked at Harry. \"Mr. Potter,\" he said\nsolemnly, with only a slight grin, \"a word of advice. There is such\na thing as a performance which is too perfect. Real people who have\njust been beaten and humiliated for fifteen minutes do not stand up\nand graciously forgive their enemies. It is the sort of thing you\ndo when you're trying to convince everyone you're not\nDark, not -\"",
      "\"I can't believe this! You can't have every possible\nobservation confirm your theory!\u202f\"",
      "\"And that was a trifle too much indignation.\"",
      "\"What on Earth do I have to do to convince you?\u202f\"",
      "\"To convince me that you harbor no ambitions of becoming a Dark\nLord?\" said Professor Quirrell, now looking outright amused. \"I\nsuppose you could just raise your right hand.\"",
      "\"What?\" Harry said blankly. \"But I can raise my right hand\nwhether or not I -\" Harry stopped, feeling rather stupid.",
      "\"Indeed,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"You can just as easily do it\neither way. There is nothing you can do to convince me because I\nwould know that was exactly what you were trying to do. And if we\nare to be even more precise, then while I suppose it is barely\npossible that perfectly good people exist even though I have never\nmet one, it is nonetheless improbable that someone would\nbe beaten for fifteen minutes and then stand up and feel a great\nsurge of kindly forgiveness for his attackers. On the other hand it\nis less improbable that a young child would imagine this\nas the role to play in order to convince his teacher and\nclassmates that he is not the next Dark Lord. The import of an act\nlies not in what that act resembles on the surface, Mr.\nPotter, but in the states of mind which make that act more or less\nprobable.\"",
      "Harry blinked. He'd just had the dichotomy between the\nrepresentativeness heuristic and the Bayesian definition of\nevidence explained to him by a wizard.",
      "\"But then again,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"anyone can want to\nimpress their friends. That need not be Dark. So without it being\nany kind of admission, Mr. Potter, tell me honestly. What thought\nwas in your mind at the moment when you forbade any vengeance? Was\nthat thought a true impulse to forgiveness? Or was it an awareness\nof how your classmates would see the act?\"",
      "Sometimes we make our own phoenix song.",
      "But Harry didn't say it out loud. It was clear that Professor\nQuirrell wouldn't believe him, and would probably respect him less\nfor trying to utter such a transparent lie.",
      "After a few moments of silence, Professor Quirrell smiled with\nsatisfaction. \"Believe it or not, Mr. Potter,\" said the professor,\n\"you need not fear me for having discovered your secret. I am\nnot going to tell you to give up on becoming the next Dark\nLord. If I could turn back the hands of time and somehow remove\nthat ambition from the mind of my child self, the self of this\npresent time would not benefit from the alteration. For as long as\nI thought that was my goal, it drove me to study and learn and\nrefine myself and become stronger. We become what we are meant to\nbe by following our desires wherever they lead. That is the insight\nof Salazar. Ask me to show you to the library section which holds\nthose same books I read as a thirteen-year-old, and I will happily\nlead the way.\"",
      "\"For the love of crap,\" Harry said, and sat down on the hard\nmarble floor, and then lay back on the floor, staring up at the\ndistant arches of the ceiling. It was as close as he could come to\ncollapsing in despair without hurting himself.",
      "\"Still too much indignation,\" observed Professor Quirrell. Harry\nwasn't looking but he could hear the suppressed laughter in the\nvoice.",
      "Then Harry realized.",
      "\"Actually, I think I know what's confusing you here,\" Harry\nsaid. \"That was what I wanted to talk to you about, in fact.\nProfessor Quirrell, I think that what you're seeing is my\nmysterious dark side.\"",
      "There was a pause.",
      "\"Your... dark side...\"",
      "Harry sat up. Professor Quirrell was regarding him with one of\nthe strangest expressions Harry had seen on anyone's face, let\nalone anyone as dignified as Professor Quirrell.",
      "\"It happens when I get angry,\" Harry explained. \"My blood runs\ncold, everything gets cold, everything seems perfectly clear... In\nretrospect it's been with me for a while - in my first year of\nMuggle school, someone tried to take away my ball during recess and\nI held it behind my back and kicked him in the solar plexus which\nI'd read was a weak point, and the other kids didn't bother me\nafter that. And I bit a math teacher when she wouldn't accept my\ndominance. But it's only just recently that I've been under enough\nstress to notice that it's an actual, you know, mysterious dark\nside, and not just an anger management problem like the school\npsychologist said. And I don't have any super magical powers when\nit happens, that was one of the first things I checked.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell rubbed his nose. \"Let me think about this,\"\nhe said.",
      "Harry waited in silence for a full minute. He used that time to\nstand up, which was more difficult than he had expected.",
      "\"Well,\" Professor Quirrell said after a while. \"I suppose there\nwas something you could say that would convince me.\"",
      "\"I have already guessed that my dark side is really\njust another part of me and that the answer isn't to never become\nangry but to learn to stay in control by accepting it, I'm not dumb\nor anything and I've seen this story enough times to know where\nit's going, but it's hard and you seem like the person to help\nme.\"",
      "\"Well... yes... very perspicacious of you, Mr. Potter, I must\nsay... that side of you is, as you seem to have already surmised,\nyour intent to kill, which as you say is a part of you...\"",
      "\"And needs to be trained,\" Harry said, completing the\npattern.",
      "\"And needs to be trained, yes.\" That strange expression was\nstill on Professor Quirrell's face. \"Mr. Potter, if you truly do\nnot wish to be the next Dark Lord, then what was the ambition which\nthe Sorting Hat tried to convince you to abandon, the ambition for\nwhich you were Sorted into Slytherin?\"",
      "\"I was Sorted into Ravenclaw!\u202f\"",
      "\"Mr. Potter,\" said Professor Quirrell, now with a much more\nusual-looking dry smile, \"I know you are accustomed to everyone\naround you being a fool, but please do not mistake me for one of\nthem. The likelihood that the Sorting Hat would play its first\nprank in eight hundred years while it was upon your head is so\nsmall as to not be worth considering. I suppose it is barely\npossible that you snapped your fingers and invented some simple and\nclever way to defeat the anti-tampering spells upon the Hat, though\nI myself can think of no such method. But by far the most probable\nexplanation is that Dumbledore decided he was not happy with the\nHat's choice for the Boy-Who-Lived. This is evident to anyone with\nthe tiniest smidgin of common sense, so your secret is safe at\nHogwarts.\"",
      "Harry opened his mouth, then closed it again with a feeling of\ncomplete helplessness. Professor Quirrell was wrong, but wrong in\nsuch a convincing way that Harry was starting to think that it\nsimply was the rational judgment given the evidence\navailable to Professor Quirrell. There were times, never\npredictable times but still sometimes, when you would get\nimprobable evidence and the best knowable guess would be wrong. If\nyou had a medical test that was only wrong one time in a thousand,\nsometimes it would still be wrong anyway.",
      "\"Can I ask you never to repeat what I'm about to say?\" said\nHarry.",
      "\"Absolutely,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"Consider me asked.\"",
      "Harry wasn't a fool either. \"Can I consider you to have said\nyes?\"",
      "\"Very good, Mr. Potter. You may indeed so consider.\"",
      "\"Professor Quirrell -\"",
      "\"I won't repeat what you're about to say,\" Professor Quirrell\nsaid, smiling.",
      "They both laughed, then Harry turned serious again. \"The Sorting\nHat did seem to think I was going to end up as a Dark Lord unless I\nwent to Hufflepuff,\" Harry said. \"But I don't want to be\none.\"",
      "\"Mr. Potter...\" said Professor Quirrell. \"Don't take this the\nwrong way. I promise you will not be graded on the answer. I only\nwant to know your own, honest reply. Why not?\"",
      "Harry had that helpless feeling again. Thou shalt\nnot become a Dark Lord was such an obvious theorem in his\nmoral system that it was hard to describe the actual proof steps.\n\"Um, people would get hurt?\"",
      "\"Surely you've wanted to hurt people,\" said Professor Quirrell.\n\"You wanted to hurt those bullies today. Being a Dark Lord means\nthat people you want to hurt get hurt.\"",
      "Harry floundered for words and then decided to simply go with\nthe obvious. \"First of all, just because I want to hurt someone\ndoesn't mean it's right -\"",
      "\"What makes something right, if not your wanting it?\"",
      "\"Ah,\" Harry said, \"preference utilitarianism.\"",
      "\"Pardon me?\" said Professor Quirrell.",
      "\"It's the ethical theory that the good is what satisfies the\npreferences of the most people -\"",
      "\"No,\" Professor Quirrell said. His fingers rubbed the bridge of\nhis nose. \"I don't think that's quite what I was trying to say. Mr.\nPotter, in the end people all do what they want to do. Sometimes\npeople give names like 'right' to things they want to do, but how\ncould we possibly act on anything but our own\ndesires?\"",
      "\"Well, obviously,\" Harry said. \"I couldn't act on moral\nconsiderations if they lacked the power to move me. But that\ndoesn't mean my wanting to hurt those Slytherins has the power to\nmove me more than moral considerations!\"",
      "Professor Quirrell blinked.",
      "\"Not to mention,\" Harry said, \"being a Dark Lord would mean that\na lot of innocent bystanders got hurt too!\"",
      "\"Why does that matter to you?\" Professor Quirrell said. \"What\nhave they done for you?\"",
      "Harry laughed. \"Oh, now that was around as subtle as\nAtlas Shrugged.\"",
      "\"Pardon me?\" Professor Quirrell said again.",
      "\"It's a book that my parents wouldn't let me read because they\nthought it would corrupt me, so of course I read it anyway and I\nwas offended they thought I would fall for any traps that obvious.\nBlah blah blah, appeal to my sense of superiority, other people are\ntrying to keep me down, blah blah blah.\"",
      "\"So you're saying I need to make my traps less obvious?\" said\nProfessor Quirrell. He tapped a finger on his cheek, looking\nthoughtful. \"I can work on that.\"",
      "They both laughed.",
      "\"But to stay with the current question,\" said Professor\nQuirrell, \"what have all these other people done for\nyou?\"",
      "\"Other people have done huge amounts for me!\" Harry\nsaid. \"My parents took me in when my parents died because they were\ngood people, and to become a Dark Lord is to betray\nthat!\"",
      "Professor Quirrell was silent for a time.",
      "\"I confess,\" said Professor Quirrell quietly, \"when I was your\nage, that thought could not ever have come to me.\"",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" Harry said.",
      "\"Don't be,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"It was long ago, and I\nresolved my parental issues to my own satisfaction. So you are held\nback by the thought of your parents' disapproval? Does that mean\nthat if they died in an accident, there would be nothing left to\nstop you from -\"",
      "\"No,\" Harry said. \"Just no. It is their impulse to\nkindness which sheltered me. That impulse is not only in my\nparents. And that impulse is what would be betrayed.\"",
      "\"In any case, Mr. Potter, you have not answered my original\nquestion,\" said Professor Quirrell finally. \"What is your\nambition?\"",
      "\"Oh,\" said Harry. \"Um..\" He organized his thoughts. \"To\nunderstand everything important there is to know about the\nuniverse, apply that knowledge to become omnipotent, and use that\npower to rewrite reality because I have some objections to the way\nit works now.\"",
      "There was a slight pause.",
      "\"Forgive me if this is a stupid question, Mr. Potter,\" said\nProfessor Quirrell, \"but are you sure you did not just\nconfess to wanting to be a Dark Lord?\"",
      "\"That's only if you use your power for evil,\" explained Harry.\n\"If you use the power for good, you're a Light Lord.\"",
      "\"I see,\" Professor Quirrell said. He tapped his other cheek with\na finger. \"I suppose I can work with that. But Mr. Potter, while\nthe scope of your ambition is worthy of Salazar himself, how\nexactly do you propose to go about it? Is step one to become a\ngreat fighting wizard, or Head Unspeakable, or Minister of Magic,\nor -\"",
      "\"Step one is to become a scientist.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell was looking at Harry as if he'd just turned\ninto a cat.",
      "\"A scientist,\" Professor Quirrell said after a while.",
      "Harry nodded.",
      "\"A scientist?\u202f\" repeated Professor Quirrell.",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry said. \"I shall achieve my objectives through the\npower... of Science!\u202f\"",
      "\"A scientist!\u202f\" said Professor Quirrell. There was\ngenuine indignation on his face, and his voice had grown stronger\nand sharper. \"You could be the best of all my students! The\ngreatest fighting wizard to come out of Hogwarts in five decades! I\ncannot picture you wasting your days in a white lab coat doing\npointless things to rats!\"",
      "\"Hey!\" said Harry. \"There's more to science than that! Not that\nthere's anything wrong with experimenting on rats, of\ncourse. But science is how you go about understanding and\ncontrolling the universe -\"",
      "\"Fool,\" said Professor Quirrell, in a voice of quiet, bitter\nintensity. \"You're a fool, Harry Potter.\" He passed a hand over his\nface, and when that hand had passed, his face was calmer. \"Or more\nlikely you have not yet found your true ambition. May I strongly\nrecommend that you try to become a Dark Lord instead? I will do\nanything I can to help as a matter of public service.\"",
      "\"You don't like science,\" Harry said slowly. \"Why not?\"",
      "\"Those fool Muggles will kill us all someday!\" Professor\nQuirrell's voice had grown louder. \"They will end it! End all of\nit!\"",
      "Harry was feeling a bit lost here. \"What are we talking about\nhere, nuclear weapons?\"",
      "\"Yes, nuclear weapons!\" Professor Quirrell was almost\nshouting now. \"Even He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named never used those,\nperhaps because he didn't want to rule over a heap of ash! They\nnever should have been made! And it will only get worse with time!\"\nProfessor Quirrell was standing up straight instead of leaning on\nhis desk. \"There are gates you do not open, there are seals you do\nnot breach! The fools who can't resist meddling are killed by the\nlesser perils early on, and the survivors all know that there are\nsecrets you do not share with anyone who lacks the\nintelligence and the discipline to discover them for themselves!\nEvery powerful wizard knows that! Even the most terrible Dark\nWizards know that! And those idiot Muggles can't seem to figure it\nout! The eager little fools who discovered the secret of nuclear\nweapons didn't keep it to themselves, they told their fool\npoliticians and now we must live under the constant threat\nof annihilation!\"",
      "This was a rather different way of looking at things than Harry\nhad grown up with. It had never occurred to him that nuclear\nphysicists should have formed a conspiracy of silence to keep the\nsecret of nuclear weapons from anyone not smart enough to be a\nnuclear physicist. The thought was intriguing, if nothing else.\nWould they have had secret passwords? Would they have had\nmasks?",
      "(Actually, for all Harry knew, there were all sorts of\nincredibly destructive secrets which physicists kept to themselves,\nand the secret of nuclear weapons was the only one that had escaped\ninto the wild. The world would look the same to him either\nway.)",
      "\"I'll have to think about that,\" Harry said to Professor\nQuirrell. \"It's a new idea to me. And one of the hidden\nsecrets of science, passed down from a few rare teachers to their\ngrad students, is how to avoid flushing new ideas down the toilet\nthe instant you hear one you don't like.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell blinked again.",
      "\"Is there any sort of science you do approve of?\" said\nHarry. \"Medicine, maybe?\"",
      "\"Space travel,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"But the Muggles seem\nto be dragging their feet on the one project which might have let\nwizardkind escape this planet before they blow it up.\"",
      "Harry nodded. \"I'm a big fan of the space program too. At least\nwe have that much in common.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell looked at Harry. Something flickered in the\nprofessor's eyes. \"I will have your word, your promise and your\noath never to speak of what follows.\"",
      "\"You have it,\" Harry said immediately.",
      "\"See to it that you keep your oath or you will not like the\nresults,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"I will now cast a rare and\npowerful spell, not on you, but on the classroom around us. Stand\nstill, so that you do not touch the boundaries of the spell once it\nhas been cast. You must not interact with the magic which I am\nmaintaining. Look only. Otherwise I will end the spell.\" Professor\nQuirrell paused. \"And try not to fall over.\"",
      "Harry nodded, puzzled and anticipatory.",
      "Professor Quirrell raised his wand and said something that\nHarry's ears and mind couldn't grasp at all, words that bypassed\nawareness and vanished into oblivion.",
      "The marble in a short radius around Harry's feet stayed\nconstant. All the other marble of the floor vanished, the walls and\nceilings vanished.",
      "Harry stood on a small circle of white marble in the midst of an\nendless field of stars, burning terribly bright and unwavering.\nThere was no Earth, no Moon, no Sun that Harry recognized.\nProfessor Quirrell stood in the same place as before, floating in\nthe midst of the starfield. The Milky Way was already visible as a\ngreat wash of light and it grew brighter as Harry's vision adjusted\nto the darkness.",
      "The sight wrenched at Harry's heart like nothing he had ever\nseen.",
      "\"Are we... in space...?\"",
      "\"No,\" said Professor Quirrell. His voice was sad, and reverent.\n\"But it is a true image.\"",
      "Tears came into Harry's eyes. He wiped them away frantically, he\nwould not miss this for some stupid water blurring his vision.",
      "The stars were no longer tiny jewels set in a giant velvet dome,\nas they were in the night sky of Earth. Here there was no sky\nabove, no surrounding sphere. Only points of perfect light against\nperfect blackness, an infinite and empty void with countless tiny\nholes through which shone the brilliance from some unimaginable\nrealm beyond.",
      "In space, the stars looked terribly, terribly, terribly\nfar away.",
      "Harry kept on wiping his eyes, over and over.",
      "\"Sometimes,\" Professor Quirrell said in a voice so quiet it\nalmost wasn't there, \"when this flawed world seems unusually\nhateful, I wonder whether there might be some other place, far\naway, where I should have been. I cannot seem to imagine what that\nplace might be, and if I can't even imagine it then how can I\nbelieve it exists? And yet the universe is so very, very wide, and\nperhaps it might exist anyway? But the stars are so very, very far\naway. It would take a long, long time to get there, even if I knew\nthe way. And I wonder what I would dream about, if I slept for a\nlong, long time...\"",
      "Though it felt like sacrilege, Harry managed a whisper. \"Please\nlet me stay here awhile.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell nodded, where he stood unsupported against\nthe stars.",
      "It was easy to forget the small circle of marble on which you\nstood, and your own body, and become a point of awareness which\nmight have been still, or might have been moving. With all\ndistances incalculable there was no way to tell.",
      "There was a time of no time.",
      "And then the stars vanished, and the classroom returned.",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"but we're about to have\ncompany.\"",
      "\"It's fine,\" Harry whispered. \"It was enough.\" He would never\nforget this day, and not because of the unimportant things that had\nhappened earlier. He would learn how to cast that spell if it was\nthe last thing he ever learned.",
      "Then the heavy oaken doors of the classroom blasted off their\nhinges and skittered across the marble floor with a high-pitched\nshriek.",
      "\"QUIRINUS! HOW DARE YOU!\u202f\"",
      "Like a vast thundercloud, an ancient and powerful wizard blew\ninto the room, a look of such incandescent rage upon his face that\nthe stern look he had earlier turned upon Harry seemed like\nnothing.",
      "There was a wrench of disorientation in Harry's mind as the part\nthat wanted to run away screaming from the scariest thing it had\never seen ran away, rotating into place a part of him which could\ntake the shock.",
      "None of Harry's facets were happy about having their\nstar-gazing interrupted. \"Headmaster Albus Percival -\" Harry\nstarted to say in icy tones.",
      "WHAM. Professor Quirrell's hand came down hard upon his\ndesk. \"Mr. Potter!\u202f\" barked Professor Quirrell. \"This is\nthe Headmaster of Hogwarts and you are a mere student! You\nwill address him appropriately!\"",
      "Harry looked at Professor Quirrell.",
      "Professor Quirrell was giving Harry a stern glare.",
      "Neither of them smiled.",
      "Dumbledore's long strides had come to a halt before where Harry\nstood in front of the dais and Professor Quirrell stood by his\ndesk. The Headmaster stared in shock at both of them.",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" Harry said in meekly polite tones. \"Headmaster,\nthank you for wanting to protect me, but Professor Quirrell did the\nright thing.\"",
      "Slowly, Dumbledore's expression changed from something that\nwould vaporize steel into something merely angry. \"I heard students\nsaying that this man had you abused by older Slytherins! That he\nforbade you to defend yourself!\"",
      "Harry nodded. \"He knew exactly what was wrong with me and he\nshowed me how to fix it.\"",
      "\"Harry, what are you talking about?\u202f\"",
      "\"I was teaching him how to lose,\" Professor Quirrell said dryly.\n\"It's an important life skill.\"",
      "It was apparent that Dumbledore still didn't understand, but his\nvoice had lowered in register. \"Harry...\" he said slowly. \"If\nthere's any threat the Defense Professor has offered you to prevent\nyou from complaining -\"",
      "You lunatic, after today of all days do you really think I\n-",
      "\"Headmaster,\" Harry said, trying to look abashed, \"what's wrong\nwith me isn't that I keep quiet about abusive professors.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell chuckled. \"Not perfect, Mr. Potter, but good\nenough for your first day. Headmaster, did you stay long enough to\nhear about the fifty-one points for Ravenclaw, or did you storm out\nas soon as you heard the first part?\"",
      "A brief look of disconcertment crossed Dumbledore's face,\nfollowed by surprise. \"Fifty-one points for Ravenclaw?\"",
      "Professor Quirrell nodded. \"He wasn't expecting them, but it\nseemed appropriate. Tell Professor McGonagall that I think the\nstory of what Mr. Potter went through to earn back the lost points\nwill do just as well to make her point. No, Headmaster, Mr. Potter\ndidn't tell me anything. It's easy to see which part of today's\nevents are her work, just as I know that the final compromise was\nyour own suggestion. Though I wonder how on Earth Mr. Potter was\nable to gain the upper hand over both Snape and you and then\nProfessor McGonagall was able to gain the upper hand over him.\"",
      "Somehow Harry managed to control his face. Was it that\nobvious to a real Slytherin?",
      "Dumbledore came closer to Harry, scrutinizing. \"Your color looks\na little off, Harry,\" the old wizard said. He peered closely at\nHarry's face. \"What did you have for lunch today?\"",
      "\"What?\" Harry said, his mind wobbling in sudden confusion. Why\nwould Dumbledore be asking about deep-fried lamb and thin-sliced\nbroccoli when that was just about the last probable cause\nof -",
      "The old wizard straightened up. \"Never mind, then. I think\nyou're fine.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell coughed, loudly and deliberately. Harry\nlooked at the professor, and saw that Professor Quirrell was\nstaring sharply at Dumbledore.",
      "\"Ah-hem!\u202f\" Professor Quirrell said again.",
      "Dumbledore and Professor Quirrell locked eyes, and something\nseemed to pass between them.",
      "\"If you don't tell him,\" Professor Quirrell said then, \"I will,\neven if you fire me for it.\"",
      "Dumbledore sighed and turned back to Harry. \"I apologize for\ninvading your mental privacy, Mr. Potter,\" the Headmaster said\nformally. \"I had no purpose except to determine if Professor\nQuirrell had done the same.\"",
      "What?",
      "The confusion lasted just exactly as long as it took Harry to\nunderstand what had just happened.",
      "\"You - !\u202f\"",
      "\"Gently, Mr. Potter,\" said Professor Quirrell. His face was\nhard, however, as he stared at Dumbledore.",
      "\"Legilimency is sometimes mistaken for common sense,\" said the\nHeadmaster. \"But it leaves traces which another skillful Legilimens\ncan detect. That was all I looked for, Mr. Potter, and I asked you\nan irrelevant question to ensure you wouldn't think about anything\nimportant while I looked.\"",
      "\"You should have asked first!\u202f\"",
      "Professor Quirrell shook his head. \"No, Mr. Potter, the\nHeadmaster had some justification for his concerns, and had he\nasked for permission you would have thought of exactly those things\nyou did not wish him to see.\" Professor Quirrell's voice grew\nsharper. \"I am rather more concerned, Headmaster, that you saw no\nneed to tell him afterward!\"",
      "\"You have now made it more difficult to confirm his mental\nprivacy on future occasions,\" Dumbledore said. He favored Professor\nQuirrell with a cold look. \"Was that your intention, I wonder?\"",
      "Professor Quirrell's expression was implacable. \"There are too\nmany Legilimens in this school. I insist that Mr. Potter receive\ninstruction in Occlumency. Will you permit me to be his tutor?\"",
      "\"Absolutely not,\" Dumbledore said at once.",
      "\"I did not think so. Then since you have deprived him\nof my free services, you will pay for Mr. Potter's\ntutoring by a licensed Occlumency instructor.\"",
      "\"Such services do not come cheaply,\" Dumbledore said, looking at\nProfessor Quirrell in some surprise. \"Although I do have certain\nconnections -\"",
      "Professor Quirrell shook his head firmly. \"No. Mr. Potter will\nask his account manager at Gringotts to recommend a neutral\ninstructor. With respect, Headmaster Dumbledore, after the events\nof this morning I must protest you or your friends having access to\nMr. Potter's mind. I must also insist that the instructor have\ntaken an Unbreakable Vow to reveal nothing, and that he agree to be\nObliviated of each session immediately afterward.\"",
      "Dumbledore was frowning. \"Such services are extremely\nexpensive, as you well know, and I cannot help but wonder why\nyou deem them necessary.\"",
      "\"If it's money that's the problem,\" Harry spoke up, \"I have some\nideas for making large amounts of money quickly -\"",
      "\"Thank you Quirinus, your wisdom is now quite evident and I am\nsorry for disputing it. Your concern for Harry Potter does you\ncredit, as well.\"",
      "\"You're welcome,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"I hope you will not\nobject if I go on making him a particular focus of my attentions.\"\nProfessor Quirrell's face was now very serious, and very still.",
      "Dumbledore looked at Harry.",
      "\"It is my own wish also,\" Harry said.",
      "\"So that's how it is to be...\" the old wizard said slowly.\nSomething strange passed across his face. \"Harry... you must\nrealize that if you choose this man as your teacher and your\nfriend, your first mentor, then one way or another you will lose\nhim, and the manner in which you lose him may or may not allow you\nto ever get him back.\"",
      "That hadn't occurred to Harry. But there was that jinx\non the Defense position... one which had apparently worked with\nperfect regularity for decades...",
      "\"Probably,\" said Professor Quirrell quietly, \"but he will have\nthe full use of me while I last.\"",
      "Dumbledore sighed. \"I suppose it is economical, at least, since\nas the Defense Professor you're already doomed in some\nunknown fashion.\"",
      "Harry had to work hard to suppress his expression as he realized\nwhat Dumbledore had actually been implying.",
      "\"I will inform Madam Pince that Mr. Potter is allowed to obtain\nbooks on Occlumency,\" said Dumbledore.",
      "\"There is preliminary training which you must do on your own,\"\nsaid Professor Quirrell to Harry. \"And I do suggest that you hurry\nup on it.\"",
      "Harry nodded.",
      "\"I'll take my leave of you then,\" said Dumbledore. He nodded to\nboth Harry and Professor Quirrell, and departed, walking a bit\nslowly.",
      "\"Can you cast the spell again?\" Harry said the moment Dumbledore\nwas gone.",
      "\"Not today,\" said Professor Quirrell quietly, \"and not tomorrow\neither, I'm afraid. It takes a lot out of me to cast, though less\nto keep going, and so I usually prefer to maintain it as long as\npossible. This time I cast it on impulse. Had I thought, and\nrealized we might be interrupted -\"",
      "Dumbledore was now Harry's least favorite person in the entire\nworld.",
      "They both sighed.",
      "\"Even if I only ever see it once,\" Harry said, \"I will never\nstop being grateful to you.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell nodded.",
      "\"Have you heard of the Pioneer program?\" Harry said. \"They were\nprobes that would fly by different planets and take pictures. Two\nof the probes would end up on trajectories that took them out of\nthe Solar System and into interstellar space. So they put a golden\nplaque on the probes, with a picture of a man, and a woman, and\nshowing where to find our Sun in the galaxy.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell was silent for a moment, then smiled. \"Tell\nme, Mr. Potter, can you guess what thought went through my mind\nwhen I finished assembling the thirty-seven items on the list of\nthings I would never do as a Dark Lord? Put yourself in my shoes -\nimagine yourself in my place - and guess.\"",
      "Harry imagined himself looking over a list of thirty-seven\nthings not to do once he became a Dark Lord.",
      "\"You decided that if you had to follow the whole list\nall the time, there wouldn't be much point in becoming a\nDark Lord in the first place,\" Harry said.",
      "\"Precisely,\" said Professor Quirrell. He was grinning.\n\"So I am going to violate rule two - which was simply 'don't brag'\n- and tell you about something I have done. I don't see how the\nknowledge could do any harm. And I strongly suspect you would have\nfigured it out anyway, once we knew each other well enough.\nNonetheless... I shall have your oath never to speak of what I am\nabout to tell.\"",
      "\"You have it!\" Harry had a feeling this was going to be\nreally good.",
      "\"I subscribe to a Muggle bulletin which keeps me informed of\nprogress on space travel. I didn't hear about Pioneer 10 until they\nreported its launch. But when I discovered that Pioneer 11 would\nalso be leaving the Solar System forever,\" Professor Quirrell said,\nhis grin the widest that Harry had yet seen from him, \"I snuck into\nNASA, I did, and I cast a lovely little spell on that lovely golden\nplaque which will make it last a lot longer than it otherwise\nwould.\"",

      "...",
      "...",
      "...",
      "\"Mr. Potter?\"",
      "\"...I can't think of anything to say.\"",
      "\"'You win' seems appropriate,\" said Professor Quirrell.",
      "\"You win,\" Harry said immediately.",
      "\"See?\" said Professor Quirrell. \"We can only imagine what giant\nheap of trouble you would have gotten into if you had been unable\nto say that.\"",
      "They both laughed.",
      "A further thought occurred to Harry. \"You didn't add any extra\ninformation to the plaque, did you?\"",
      "\"Extra information?\" said Professor Quirrell, sounding as if the\nidea had never occurred to him before and he was quite\nintrigued.",
      "Which made Harry rather suspicious, considering that it'd taken\nless than a minute for Harry to think of it.",
      "\"Maybe you included a holographic message like in Star\nWars?\u202f\" said Harry. \"Or... hm. A portrait seems to store a\nwhole human brain's worth of information... you couldn't have added\nany extra mass to the probe, but maybe you could've turned an\nexisting part into a portrait of yourself? Or you found a volunteer\ndying of a terminal illness, snuck them into NASA, and cast a spell\nto make sure their ghost ended up in the plaque -\"",
      "\"Mr. Potter,\" Professor Quirrell said, his voice suddenly sharp,\n\"a spell requiring a human death would certainly be classified by\nthe Ministry as Dark Arts, regardless of circumstances. Students\nshould not be heard talking about such things.\"",
      "And the amazing thing about the way Professor Quirrell said it\nwas how perfectly it maintained plausible deniability. It had been\nsaid in exactly the appropriate tone for someone who wasn't willing\nto discuss such things and thought students should steer away from\nthem. Harry honestly didn't know whether Professor\nQuirrell was just waiting to talk about it until after Harry had\nlearned to protect his mind.",
      "\"Got it,\" Harry said. \"I won't talk with anyone else about that\nidea.\"",
      "\"Please be discreet about the whole matter, Mr. Potter,\"\nProfessor Quirrell said. \"I prefer to go through my life without\nattracting public notice. You will find nothing in the newspapers\nabout Quirinus Quirrell until I decided it was time for me to teach\nDefense at Hogwarts.\"",
      "That seemed a little sad, but Harry understood. Then Harry\nrealized the implications. \"So just how much awesome stuff\nhave you done that no one else knows about -\"",
      "\"Oh, some,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"But I think that's quite\nenough for today, Mr. Potter, I confess I am feeling a bit tired\n-\"",
      "\"I understand. And thank you. For\neverything.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell nodded, but he was leaning harder on his\ndesk.",
      "Harry quickly took his leave."

      "Rowling is whoever does Rowling's job.",
      "Hermione Granger had worried she was turning Bad.",
      "The difference between Good and Bad was usually easy to grasp,\nshe'd never understood why other people had so much trouble. At\nHogwarts, \"Good\" was Professor Flitwick and Professor McGonagall\nand Professor Sprout. \"Bad\" was Professor Snape and Professor\nQuirrell and Draco Malfoy. Harry Potter... was one of those unusual\ncases where you couldn't tell just by looking. She was\nstill trying to figure out where he belonged.",
      "But when it came to herself...",
      "Hermione was having too much fun crushing Harry\nPotter.",
      "She'd done better than him in every single class they'd taken.\n(Except for broomstick riding which was like gym class, it didn't\ncount.) She'd gotten real House points almost every day of\ntheir first week, not for weird heroic things, but smart\nthings like learning spells quickly and helping other students. She\nknew those kinds of House points were better, and the best part\nwas, Harry Potter knew it too. She could see it in his eyes every\ntime she won another real House point.",
      "If you were Good, you weren't supposed to enjoy winning this\nmuch.",
      "It had started on the day of the train ride, though it had taken\na while for the whirlwind to sink in. It wasn't until later that\nnight that Hermione had begun to realize just how much\nshe'd let that boy walk all over her.",
      "Before she'd met Harry Potter she hadn't had anyone she'd wanted\nto crush. If someone wasn't doing as well as her in class, it was\nher job to help them, not rub it in. That was what it meant to be\nGood.",
      "And now...",
      "...now she was winning, Harry Potter was flinching\nevery time she got another House point, and it was so much\nfun, her parents had warned her against drugs and she suspected\nthis was more fun than that.",
      "She'd always liked the smiles that teachers gave her when she\ndid something right. She'd always liked seeing the long row of\ncheck-marks on a perfectly answered test. But now when she did well\nin class she would casually glance around and catch a glimpse of\nHarry Potter gritting his teeth, and it made her want to burst into\nsong like a Disney movie.",
      "That was Bad, wasn't it?",
      "Hermione had worried she was turning Bad.",
      "And then a thought had come to her which wiped away all her\nfears.",
      "She and Harry were getting into a Romance! Of course! Everyone\nknew what it meant when a boy and a girl started fighting all the\ntime. They were courting one another! There was nothing\nBad about that.",
      "It couldn't be that she just enjoyed beating the living\nscholastic daylights out of the most famous student in the school,\nsomeone who was in books and talked like books,\nthe boy who had somehow vanquished the Dark Lord and even smushed\nProfessor Snape like a sad little bug, the boy who was, as\nProfessor Quirrell would have put it, dominant, over everyone else\nin first-year Ravenclaw except for Hermione Granger who\nwas utterly squishing the Boy-Who-Lived in all his classes\nbesides broomstick riding.",
      "Because that would have been Bad.",
      "No. It was Romance. That was it. That was why\nthey were fighting.",
      "Hermione was glad she had figured this out in time for today,\nwhen Harry would lose their book-reading contest, which the\nwhole school knew about, and she wanted to start\ndancing with the sheer overflowing joy of it.",
      "It was 2:45pm on Saturday and Harry Potter had half of Bathilda\nBagshot's A History of Magic left to read and she was\nstaring at her pocket watch as it ticked with dreadful slowness\ntoward 2:47pm.",
      "And the entire Ravenclaw common room was watching.",
      "It wasn't just the first-years, news had spread like spilled\nmilk and fully half of Ravenclaw was crowded into the room,\nsqueezed into sofas and leaning on bookcases and sitting on the\narms of chairs. All six prefects were there including the Head Girl\nof Hogwarts. Someone had needed to cast an Air-Freshening Charm\njust so that there would be enough oxygen. And the din of\nconversation had died into whispers which had now faded into utter\nsilence.",
      "2:46pm.",
      "The tension was unbearable. If it had been anyone else,\nanyone else, his defeat would have been a foregone\nconclusion.",
      "But this was Harry Potter, and you couldn't rule out the\npossibility that he would, sometime in the next few seconds, raise\na hand and snap his fingers.",
      "With sudden terror she realized how Harry Potter might be able\nto do exactly that. It would be just like him to have\nalready finished reading the second half of the book\nearlier...",
      "Hermione's vision began to swim. She tried to make herself\nbreathe, and found that she simply couldn't.",
      "Ten seconds left, and he still hadn't raised his hand.",
      "Five seconds left.",
      "2:47pm.",
      "Harry Potter carefully placed a bookmark into his book, closed\nit, and laid it aside.",
      "\"I would like to note for the benefit of posterity,\" said the\nBoy-Who-Lived in a clear voice, \"that I had only half a book left,\nand that I ran into a number of unexpected delays -\"",
      "\"You lost!\u202f\" shrieked Hermione. \"You did! You\nlost our contest!\u202f\"",
      "There was a collective exhalation as everyone started breathing\nagain.",
      "Harry Potter shot her a Look of Flaming Fire, but she was\nfloating in a halo of pure white happiness and nothing could touch\nher.",
      "\"Do you realize what kind of week I've had?\u202f\" said\nHarry Potter. \"Any lesser being would have been hard-pressed to\nread eight Dr. Seuss books!\"",
      "\"You set the time limit.\"",
      "Harry's Look of Flaming Fire grew even hotter. \"I did not have\nany logical way of knowing I'd have to save the entire school from\nProfessor Snape, or get beaten up in Defense class, and if I told\nyou how I lost all the time between 5pm and dinner on Thursday you\nwould think I was insane -\"",
      "\"Awww, it sounds like someone fell prey to the\nplanning fallacy.\"",
      "Raw shock showed on Harry Potter's face.",
      "\"Oh that reminds me, I finished reading the first batch of books\nyou lent me,\" Hermione said with her best innocent look. A couple\nof them had been hard books, too. She wondered how long it\nhad taken him to finish reading them.",
      "\"Someday,\" said the Boy-Who-Lived, \"when the distant descendants\nof Homo sapiens are looking back over the history of the\ngalaxy and wondering how it all went so wrong, they will conclude\nthat the original mistake was when someone taught Hermione Granger\nhow to read.\"",
      "\"But you still lose,\" said Hermione. She held a hand to her chin\nand looked contemplative. \"Now what exactly should you lose, I\nwonder?\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\"",
      "\"You lost the bet,\" Hermione explained, \"so you have to pay a\nforfeit.\"",
      "\"I don't remember agreeing to this!\"",
      "\"Really?\" said Hermione Granger. She put a thoughtful look on\nher face. Then, as if the idea had only just then occurred to her,\n\"We'll take a vote, then. Everyone in Ravenclaw who thinks Harry\nPotter has to pay up, raise your hand!\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" shrieked Harry Potter again.",
      "He spun around and saw that he was surrounded by a sea of raised\nhands.",
      "And if Harry Potter had looked more carefully, he would\nhave noticed that an awful lot of the onlookers seemed to be girls\nand that practically every female in the room had their hand\nraised.",
      "\"Stop!\" wailed Harry Potter. \"You don't know what she's going to\nask! Don't you realize what she's doing? She's getting you\nto make an advance commitment now, and then the pressure of\nconsistency will make you agree with whatever she says\nafterward!\"",
      "\"Don't worry,\" said the prefect Penelope Clearwater. \"If she\nasks for something unreasonable, we can just change our minds.\nRight, everyone?\"",
      "And there were eager nods from all the girls whom Penelope\nClearwater had told about Hermione's plan.",
      "A silent figure quietly slipped through the chilled halls of the\nHogwarts dungeons. He was to be present in a certain room at 6:00pm\nto meet a certain someone, and if at all possible it was best to be\nearly, to show respect.",
      "But when his hand turned the doorknob and opened the door into\nthat dark, silent, unused classroom, there was a silhouette already\nstanding there amid the rows of dusty old desks. A silhouette which\nheld a small green glowing rod, casting a pale light which hardly\nilluminated even he who held it, let alone the surrounding\nroom.",
      "The light of the hallway died as the door closed and shut behind\nhim, and Draco's eyes began the process of adjusting to the dim\nglow.",
      "The silhouette slowly turned to behold him, revealing a shadowed\nface only partially lit by the eerie green light.",
      "Draco liked this meeting already. Keep the chill green light,\nmake them both taller, give them hoods and masks, move them from a\nclassroom to a graveyard, and it would be just like the start of\nhalf the stories his father's friends told about the Death\nEaters.",
      "\"I want you to know, Draco Malfoy,\" said the silhouette in tones\nof deadly calm, \"that I do not blame you for my recent defeat.\"",
      "Draco opened his mouth in unthinking protest, there was no\npossible reason why he should be blamed -",
      "\"It was due, more than anything else, to my own stupidity,\"\ncontinued that shadowy figure. \"There were many other things I\ncould have done, at any step along the way. You did not ask me to\ndo exactly what I did. You only asked for help. I was the\none who unwisely chose that particular method. But the fact remains\nthat I lost the contest by half a book. The actions of your pet\nidiot, and the favor you asked for, and, yes, my own foolishness in\ngoing about it, caused me to lose time. More time than you\nknow. Time which, in the end, proved critical. The fact remains,\nDraco Malfoy, that if you had not asked that favor, I\nwould have won. And not... instead... lost.\"",
      "Draco had already heard about Harry's loss, and the forfeit\nGranger had claimed from him. The news had spread faster than owls\ncould have carried it.",
      "\"I understand,\" Draco said. \"I'm sorry.\" There was nothing else\nhe could say if he wanted Harry Potter to be friends with\nhim.",
      "\"I am not asking for understanding or sorrow,\" said the dark\nsilhouette, still with that deadly calm. \"But I have just spent two\nfull hours in the presence of Hermione Granger, dressed in such\nclothing as was provided me, visiting such fascinating places in\nHogwarts as a tiny burbling waterfall of what looked to me like\nsnot, accompanied by a number of other girls who insisted on such\nhelpful activities as strewing our path with Transfigured rose\npetals. I have been on a date, scion of Malfoy. My first\ndate. And when I call that favor due, you will pay\nit.\"",
      "Draco nodded solemnly. Before arriving he had taken the wise\nprecaution of learning every available detail of Harry's date, so\nthat he could get all of his hysterical laughing done before their\nappointed meeting time, and would not commit a faux pas by\ngiggling continuously until he lost consciousness.",
      "\"Do you think,\" Draco said, \"that something sad ought to happen\nto the Granger girl -\"",
      "\"Spread the word in Slytherin that the Granger girl is\nmine and anyone who meddles in my affairs will\nhave their remains scattered over an area wide enough to include\ntwelve different spoken languages. And since I am not in Gryffindor\nand I use cunning rather than immediate frontal attacks,\nthey should not panic if I am seen smiling at her.\"",
      "\"Or if you're seen on a second date?\" Draco said, allowing just\na tiny note of skepticism into his voice.",
      "\"There will be no second date,\" said the green-lit\nsilhouette in a voice so fearsome that it sounded, not only like a\nDeath Eater, but like Amycus Carrow that one time just before\nFather told him to stop it, he wasn't the Dark Lord.",
      "Of course it was still a young boy's high unbroken\nvoice and when you combined that with the actual words,\nwell, it just didn't work. If Harry Potter did become the\nnext Dark Lord someday, Draco would use a Pensieve to store a copy\nof this memory somewhere safe, and Harry Potter would never dare\nbetray him.",
      "\"But let us talk of happier matters,\" said the green-shadowed\nfigure. \"Let us talk of knowledge and of power. Draco Malfoy, let\nus talk of Science.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" said Draco. \"Let us speak.\"",
      "Draco wondered how much of his own face could be seen, and how\nmuch was in shadow, in that eerie green light.",
      "And though Draco kept his face serious, there was a smile in his\nheart.",
      "He was finally having a real grownup conversation.",
      "\"I offer you power,\" said the shadowy figure, \"and I will tell\nyou of that power and its price. The power comes from knowing the\nshape of reality and so gaining control over it. What you\nunderstand, you can command, and that is power enough to walk upon\nthe Moon. The price of that power is that you must learn to ask\nquestions of Nature, and far more difficult, accept Nature's\nanswers. You will do experiments, perform tests and see what\nhappens. And you must accept the meaning of those results when they\ntell you that you are mistaken. You will have to learn how to\nlose, not to me, but to Nature. When you find yourself arguing\nwith reality, you will have to let reality win. You will find this\npainful, Draco Malfoy, and I do not know if you are strong in that\nway. Knowing the price, is it still your wish to learn the human\npower?\"",
      "Draco took a deep breath. He'd thought about this. And it was\nhard to see how he could answer any other way. He'd been instructed\nto take every avenue of friendship with Harry Potter. It was just\nlearning, he wasn't promising to do anything. He\ncould always stop the lessons at any time...",
      "There were certainly any number of things about the situation\nwhich made it look like a trap, but in all honesty, Draco didn't\nsee how this could go wrong.",
      "Plus Draco did kind of want to rule the world.",
      "\"Yes,\" said Draco.",
      "\"Excellent,\" said the shadowy figure. \"I have had something of a\ncrowded week, and it will take time to plan your\ncurriculum -\"",
      "\"I've got a lot of things I need to do myself to consolidate my\npower in Slytherin,\" said Draco, \"not to mention homework. Maybe we\nshould just start in October?\"",
      "\"Sounds sensible,\" said the shadowy figure, \"but what I meant to\nsay is that to plan your curriculum, I need to know what I will be\nteaching you. Three thoughts come to me. The first is that I teach\nyou of the human mind and brain. The second option is that I teach\nyou of the physical universe, those arts which lie on the pathway\nto visiting the Moon. This involves a great deal of numbers, but to\na certain kind of mind those numbers are more beautiful than\nanything else Science has to teach. Do you like numbers,\nDraco?\"",
      "Draco shook his head.",
      "\"Then so much for that. You will learn your mathematics\neventually, but not right away, I think. The third option is that I\nteach you of genetics and evolution and inheritance, what you would\ncall blood -\"",
      "\"That one,\" said Draco.",
      "The figure nodded. \"I thought you might say as much. But I think\nit will be the most painful path for you, Draco. What if your\nfamily and friends, the blood purists, say one thing, and you find\nthat the experimental test says another?\"",
      "\"Then I'll figure out how to make the experimental test say the\nright answer!\"",
      "There was a pause, as the shadowy figure stood there with its\nmouth open for a short while.",
      "\"Um,\" said the shadowy figure. \"It doesn't really work like\nthat. That's what I was trying to warn you about here, Draco. You\ncan't make the answer come out to be anything you\nlike.\"",
      "\"You can always make the answer come out your way,\"\nsaid Draco. That had been practically the first thing his tutors\nhad taught him. \"It's just a matter of finding the right\narguments.\"",
      "\"No,\" said the shadowy figure, voice rising in frustration, \"no,\nno, no! Then you get the wrong answer and you can't go to\nthe Moon that way! Nature isn't a person, you can't trick them into\nbelieving something else, if you try to tell the Moon it's made of\ncheese you can argue for days and it won't change the Moon! What\nyou're talking about is rationalization, like starting\nwith a sheet of paper, moving straight down to the bottom line,\nusing ink to write 'and therefore, the Moon is made of\ncheese', and then moving back up to write all sorts of clever\narguments above. But either the Moon is made of cheese or it isn't.\nThe moment you wrote the bottom line, it was already true or\nalready false. Whether or not the whole sheet of paper ends up with\nthe right conclusion or the wrong conclusion is fixed the instant\nyou write down the bottom line. If you're trying to pick between\ntwo expensive trunks, and you like the shiny one, it doesn't matter\nwhat clever arguments you come up with for buying it, the\nreal rule you used to choose which trunk to argue\nfor was 'pick the shiny one', and however effective that rule\nis at picking good trunks, that's the kind of trunk you'll get.\nRationality can't be used to argue for a fixed side, its\nonly possible use is deciding which side to argue. Science\nisn't for convincing anyone that the blood purists are\nright. That's politics! The power of science comes from\nfinding out the way Nature really is that can't be changed by\narguing! What science can do is tell us how blood\nreally works, how wizards really inherit their powers from\ntheir parents, and whether Muggleborns are really weaker or\nstronger -\"",
      "\"Stronger!\u202f\" said Draco. He had been trying to follow\nthis, a puzzled frown on his face, he could see how it\nsort of made sense but it certainly wasn't like anything\nhe'd ever heard before. And then Harry Potter had said something\nDraco couldn't possibly let pass. \"You think mudbloods are\nstronger?\u202f\"",
      "\"I think nothing,\" said the shadowy figure. \"I know nothing. I\nbelieve nothing. My bottom line is not yet written. I will figure\nout how to test the magical strength of Muggleborns, and the\nmagical strength of purebloods. If my tests tell me that\nMuggleborns are weaker, I will believe they are weaker. If my tests\ntell me that Muggleborns are stronger, I will believe they are\nstronger. Knowing this and other truths, I will gain some measure\nof power -\"",
      "\"And you expect me to believe whatever you say?\" Draco\ndemanded hotly.",
      "\"I expect you to perform the tests personally,\" said\nthe shadowy figure quietly. \"Are you afraid of what you\nwill find?\"",
      "Draco stared at the shadowy figure for a while, his eyes\nnarrowed. \"Nice trap, Harry,\" he said. \"I'll have to remember that\none, it's new.\"",
      "The shadowy figure shook his head. \"It's not a trap, Draco.\nRemember - I don't know what we'll find. But you do not\nunderstand the universe by arguing with it or telling it to come\nback with a different answer next time. When you put on the robes\nof a scientist you must forget all your politics and arguments and\nfactions and sides, silence the desperate clingings of your mind,\nand wish only to hear the answer of Nature.\" The shadowy figure\npaused. \"Most people can't do it. That's why this is difficult. Are\nyou sure you wouldn't rather just learn about the brain?\"",
      "\"And if I tell you I'd rather learn about the brain,\" Draco\nsaid, his voice now hard, \"you'll go around telling people that I\nwas afraid of what I'd find.\"",
      "\"No,\" said the shadowy figure. \"I will do no such thing.\"",
      "\"But you might do the same sort of tests yourself, and if you\ngot the wrong answer, I wouldn't be there to say anything before\nyou showed it to someone else.\" Draco's voice was still hard.",
      "\"I would still ask you first, Draco,\" the shadowy figure said\nquietly.",
      "Draco paused. He hadn't been expecting that, he'd thought he saw\nthe trap but... \"You would?\u202f\"",
      "\"Of course. How would I know who to blackmail or what\nwe could ask from them? Draco, I say again that this is not a trap\nI set for you. At least not for you personally. If your politics\nwere different, I would be saying, what if the test shows that\npurebloods are stronger.\"",
      "\"Really.\"",
      "\"Yes! That's the price anyone has to pay to\nbecome a scientist!\"",
      "Draco held up a hand. He had to think.",
      "The shadowy, green-lit figure waited.",
      "It didn't take long to think about, though. If you discarded all\nthe confusing parts... then Harry Potter was planning to mess\naround with something that could cause a gigantic political\nexplosion, and it would be insane to just walk away and let him do\nit on his own. \"We'll study blood,\" said Draco.",
      "\"Excellent,\" said the figure, and smiled.\n\"Congratulations on being willing to ask the question.\"",
      "\"Thanks,\" Draco said, not quite managing to keep the irony out\nof his voice.",
      "\"Hey, did you think going to the Moon was easy? Be glad\nthis just involves changing your mind sometimes, and not a human\nsacrifice!\"",
      "\"Human sacrifice would be way easier!\"",
      "There was a slight pause, and then the figure nodded. \"Fair\npoint.\"",
      "\"Look, Harry,\" said Draco without much hope, \"I thought the idea\nwas to take all the things that Muggles know, combine them with\nthings that wizards know, and become masters of both worlds.\nWouldn't it be a lot easier to just study all the things that\nMuggles already found out, like the Moon stuff, and use\nthat power -\"",
      "\"No,\" said the figure with a sharp shake of his head,\nsending green shadows moving around his nose and eyes. His voice\nhad turned very grim. \"If you cannot learn the scientist's art of\naccepting reality, then I must not tell you what that\nacceptance has discovered. It would be like a powerful wizard\ntelling you of those gates which must not be opened, and those\nseals which must not be broken, before you had proven your\nintelligence and discipline by surviving the lesser perils.\"",
      "A chill went down Draco's spine and he shuddered involuntarily.\nHe knew it had been visible even in the dim light. \"All right,\"\nsaid Draco. \"I understand.\" Father had told him that many times.\nWhen a more powerful wizard told you that you weren't ready to\nknow, you didn't pry any further if you wanted to live.",
      "The figure inclined his head. \"Indeed. But there is something\nelse you should understand. The first scientists, being Muggles,\nlacked your traditions. In the beginning they simply did not\ncomprehend the notion of dangerous knowledge, and thought that all\nthings known should be spoken freely. When their searches turned\ndangerous, they told their politicians of things that should have\nstayed secret - don't look like that, Draco, it wasn't simple\nstupidity. They did have to be smart enough to uncover the secret\nin the first place. But they were Muggles, it was the first time\nthey'd found anything really dangerous, and they didn't\nstart out with a tradition of secrecy. There was a war\ngoing on, and the scientists on one side worried that if they\ndidn't talk, the scientists of the enemy country\nwould tell their politicians first...\" The voice trailed\noff significantly. \"They didn't destroy the world. But it was\nclose. And we are not going to repeat that mistake.\"",
      "\"Right,\" Draco said, his voice now very firm. \"We\nwon't. We're wizards, and studying science doesn't make us\nMuggles.\"",
      "\"As you say,\" said the green-lit silhouette. \"We will establish\nour own Science, a magical Science, and that Science will\nhave smarter traditions from the very start.\" The voice grew hard.\n\"The knowledge I share with you will be taught alongside the\ndisciplines of accepting truth, the level of this knowledge will be\nkeyed to your progress in those disciplines, and you will share\nthat knowledge with no one else who has not learned those\ndisciplines. Do you accept this?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" said Draco. What was he supposed to do, say no?",
      "\"Good. And what you discover for yourself, you will keep to\nyourself unless you think that other scientists are ready to know\nit. What we do share among ourselves, we will not tell the world\nunless we agree it is safe for the world to know. And whatever our\nown politics and allegiances, we will all punish\nany of our number who reveal dangerous magics or give away\ndangerous weapons, no matter what sort of war is going on. From\nthis day onward, that will be the tradition and the law of science\namong wizards. Are we agreed on that?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" said Draco. Actually this was starting to sound\npretty attractive. The Death Eaters had tried to take power by\nbeing scarier than everyone else, and they hadn't actually won yet.\nMaybe it was time to try ruling using secrets instead. \"And our\ngroup stays hidden for as long as possible, and everyone in it has\nto agree to our rules.\"",
      "\"Of course. Definitely.\"",

      "\"We're going to need better robes,\" said the shadowy figure,\n\"with hoods and so on -\"",
      "\"I was just thinking that,\" said Draco. \"We don't need\nwhole new robes, though, just cowled cloaks to put on. I have a\nfriend in Slytherin, she'll take your measurements -\"",

      "\"I'm not stupid!\u202f\"",
      "\"And no masks for now, not when it's just you and me -\" said the\nshadowy figure.",

      "\"It's called a PhD and wouldn't that make it too easy to\nidentify our people?\"",
      "\"Huh?\"",
      "\"I mean, what if someone is like 'okay, now everyone pull up\ntheir robes over their right arms' and our guy is like 'whoops,\nsorry, looks like I'm a spy' -\"",
      "\"Forget I said anything,\" said Draco, sweat suddenly\nspringing out all over his body. He needed a distraction,\nfast - \"And what do we call ourselves? The Science\nEaters?\"",
      "\"No,\" said the shadowy figure slowly. \"That doesn't sound\nright...\"",
      "Draco wiped his robed arm across his forehead, wiping away beads\nof moisture. What had the Dark Lord been thinking? Father\nhad said the Dark Lord was smart!",
      "\"I've got it!\" said the shadowy figure suddenly. \"You won't\nunderstand yet, but trust me, it fits.\"",
      "Right now Draco would have accepted 'Malfoy Munchers' as long as\nit changed the subject. \"What is it?\"",
      "And standing amid the dusty desks in an unused classroom in the\ndungeons of Hogwarts, the green-lit silhouette of Harry Potter\nspread his arms dramatically and said, \"This day shall mark the\ndawn of... the Bayesian Conspiracy.\"",
      "A silent figure trudged wearily through the halls of Hogwarts in\nthe direction of Ravenclaw.",
      "Harry had gone straight from the meeting with Draco to dinner,\nand stayed at dinner barely long enough to choke down a few fast\ngulps of food before going off to bed.",
      "It wasn't even 7pm yet, but it was well past bedtime for Harry.\nHe'd realized last night that he wouldn't be able to use\nthe Time-Turner on Saturday until after the book-reading contest\nwas already over. But he could still use the Time-Turner on\nFriday night, and gain time that way. So Harry had pushed\nhimself to stay awake until 9pm on Friday, when the protective\nshell opened, and then used the four hours remaining on the\nTime-Turner to spin back to 5pm and collapse into sleep. He'd woken\nup around 2am on Saturday morning, just as planned, and read for\nthe next twelve hours straight... and it still hadn't been enough.\nAnd now Harry would be going to sleep rather early for the next few\ndays, until his sleep cycle caught up again.",
      "The portrait on the door asked Harry some dumb riddle meant for\neleven-year-olds that he answered without the words even passing\nthrough his conscious mind, and then Harry staggered up the stairs\nto his dorm room, changed into his pajamas and collapsed into\nbed.",
      "And found that his pillow seemed rather lumpy.",
      "Harry groaned. He sat up reluctantly, twisted in bed, and lifted\nup his pillow.",
      "This revealed a note, two golden Galleons, and a book titled\nOcclumency: The Hidden Arte.",
      "Harry picked up the note and read:",
      "My, you do get yourself into trouble and quickly. Your\nfather was no match for you.",
      "You have made a powerful enemy. Snape commands the loyalty,\nadmiration, and fear of all House Slytherin. You cannot trust any\nof that House now, whether they come to you in friendly guise or\nfearsome.",
      "From now on you must not meet Snape's eyes. He is a\nLegilimens and can read your mind if you do. I have enclosed a book\nwhich may help you learn to protect yourself, though there is only\nso far you can get without a tutor. Still you may hope to at least\ndetect intrusion.",
      "So that you may find some extra time in which to study\nOcclumency, I have enclosed 2 Galleons, which is the price of\nanswer sheets and homework for the first-year History of Magic\nclass (Professor Binns having given the same tests and same\nassignments every year since he died). Your newfound friends the\nWeasley twins should be able to sell you a copy. It goes without\nsaying that you must not get caught with it in your\npossession.",
      "Of Professor Quirrell I know little. He is a Slytherin and a\nDefense Professor, and that is two marks against him. Consider\ncarefully any advice he gives you, and tell him nothing you do not\nwish known.",
      "Dumbledore only pretends to be insane. He is extremely\nintelligent, and if you continue to step into closets and vanish,\nhe will certainly deduce your possession of an invisibility cloak\nif he has not done so already. Avoid him whenever possible, hide\nthe Cloak of Invisibility somewhere safe (NOT your pouch) any time\nyou cannot avoid him, and step with great care in his\npresence.",
      "Please be more careful in the future, Harry Potter.",
      "- Santa Claus",
      "Harry stared at the note.",
      "It did seem to be pretty good advice. Of course Harry\nwasn't going to cheat in History class even if they gave him a dead\nmonkey for a professor. But Severus's Legilimency... whoever'd sent\nthis note knew a lot of important, secret things and was willing to\ntell Harry about them. The note was still warning him against\nDumbledore stealing the Cloak but at this point Harry honestly had\nno clue if that was a bad sign, it could just be an understandable\nmistake.",
      "There seemed to be some sort of intrigue going on inside\nHogwarts. Maybe if Harry compared stories between\nDumbledore and the note-sender, he could work out a\ncombined picture that would be accurate? Like if they\nboth agreed on something, then...",
      "...whatever...",
      "Harry stuffed everything into his pouch and turned up the\nQuieter and pulled the cover over his head and died.",
      "It was Sunday morning and Harry was eating pancakes in the Great\nHall, sharp quick bites, glancing nervously at his watch every few\nseconds.",
      "It was 8:02am, and in precisely two hours and one minute, it\nwould be exactly one week since he'd seen the Weasleys and\ncrossed over onto Platform Nine and Three-Quarters.",
      "And the thought had occurred to him... Harry didn't know if this\nwas a valid way to think about the universe, he didn't know\nanything any more, but it seemed possible...",
      "That...",
      "Not enough interesting things had happened to him over the\nlast week.",
      "When he was done eating breakfast, Harry planned to go straight\nup to his room and hide in the bottom level of his trunk and not\ntalk to anyone until 10:03am.",
      "And that was when Harry saw the Weasley twins walking toward\nhim. One of them was carrying something concealed behind his\nback.",
      "He should scream and run away.",
      "He should scream and run away.",
      "Whatever this was... it could very well be...",
      "...the grand finale...",
      "He really should just scream and run away.",
      "With a resigned feeling that the universe would come and get him\nanyway, Harry continued slicing at the pancake with his\nfork and knife. He couldn't muster the energy. That was the sad\ntruth. Harry knew now how people felt when they were tired of\nrunning, tired of trying to escape fate, and they just fell to the\nground and let the horrifically befanged and tentacled demons of\nthe darkest abyss drag them off to their unspeakable destiny.",
      "The Weasley twins drew closer.",
      "And yet closer.",
      "Harry ate another bite of pancake.",
      "The Weasley twins arrived, grinning brightly.",
      "\"Hello, Fred,\" Harry said dully. One of the twins nodded.\n\"Hello, George.\" The other twin nodded.",
      "\"You sound tired,\" said George.",
      "\"You should cheer up,\" said Fred.",
      "\"Look what we got you!\"",
      "And George took, from behind Fred's back -",
      "A cake with twelve flaming candles.",
      "There was a pause, as the Ravenclaw table stared at them.",
      "\"That's not right,\" said someone. \"Harry Potter was born on the\nthirty-first of Jul-\"",
      "\"HE IS COMING,\" said a huge hollow voice that cut\nthrough all conversation like a sword of ice. \"THE ONE WHO WILL\nTEAR APART THE VERY -\"",
      "Dumbledore had leapt out of his throne and run straight over the\nHead Table and seized hold of the woman speaking those awful words,\nFawkes had appeared in a flash, and all three of them vanished in a\ncrack of fire.",
      "There was a shocked pause...",
      "...followed by heads turning in the direction of Harry\nPotter.",
      "\"I didn't do it,\" Harry said in a tired voice.",
      "\"That was a prophecy!\u202f\" someone at the table hissed.\n\"And I bet it's about you!\u202f\"",
      "Harry sighed.",
      "He stood up from his seat, raised his voice, and said very\nloudly over the conversations that were starting up, \"It's not\nabout me! Obviously! I'm not coming here, I'm already\nhere!\u202f\"",
      "Harry sat back down again.",
      "The people who had been looking at him turned away again.",
      "Someone else at the table said, \"Then who is it\nabout?\"",
      "And with a dull, leaden sensation, Harry realized who\nwasn't already at Hogwarts.",
      "Call it a wild guess, but Harry had a feeling the undead Dark\nLord would be showing up one of these days.",
      "The conversation continued on around him.",
      "\"Not to mention, tear apart the very what?\u202f\"",
      "\"I thought I heard Trelawney start to say something with an 'S'\njust before the Headmaster grabbed her.\"",
      "\"Like... soul? Sun?\"",
      "\"If someone's going to tear apart the Sun we're really\nin trouble!\"",
      "That seemed rather unlikely to Harry, unless the world contained\nscary things which had heard of David Criswell's ideas about star\nlifting.",
      "\"So,\" Harry said in tired tones, \"this happens every Sunday\nbreakfast, does it?\"",
      "\"No,\" said a student who might have been in his seventh year,\nfrowning grimly. \"It doesn't.\"",
      "Harry shrugged. \"Whatever. Anyone want some birthday cake?\"",
      "\"But it's not your birthday!\" said the same student\nwho'd objected last time.",
      "That was the cue for Fred and George to start laughing, of\ncourse.",
      "Even Harry managed a weary smile.",
      "As the first slice was served to him, Harry said, \"I've had a\nreally long week.\"",
      "And Harry was sitting in the cavern level of his trunk, slid\nshut and locked so no one could get in, a blanket pulled over his\nhead, waiting for the week to be over.",
      "10:01.",
      "10:02.",
      "10:03, but just to be sure...",
      "10:04 and the first week was done.",
      "Harry breathed a sigh of relief, and gingerly pulled the blanket\noff of his head.",
      "A few moments later, he had emerged into the bright sunlit air\nof his dorm.",
      "Shortly after, and he was in the Ravenclaw common room. A few\npeople looked at him, but no one said anything or tried to talk to\nhim.",
      "Harry found a nice wide writing desk, pulled back a comfortable\nchair, and sat down. From his pouch he drew a sheet of paper and a\npencil.",
      "Mum and Dad had told Harry in no uncertain terms that while they\nunderstood his enthusiasm for leaving home and getting away from\nhis parents, he was to write them every week without fail,\njust so that they knew he was alive, unharmed, and not in\nprison.",
      "Harry stared down at the blank sheet of paper. Let's\nsee...",
      "After leaving his parents at the train station, he'd...",
      "...gotten acquainted with a boy raised by Darth Vader, become\nfriends with the three most infamous pranksters in Hogwarts, met\nHermione, then there'd been the Incident with the Sorting Hat...\nMonday he'd been given a time machine to treat his sleep disorder,\ngotten a legendary invisibility cloak from an unknown benefactor,\nrescued seven Hufflepuffs by staring down five scary older boys one\nof whom had threatened to break his finger, realized that he\npossessed a mysterious dark side, learned to cast\nFrigideiro in Charms class, and gotten started on his\nrivalry with Hermione... Tuesday had introduced Astronomy taught by\nProfessor Aurora Sinistra who was nice, and History of Magic taught\nby a ghost who ought to be exorcised and replaced with a tape\nrecorder... Wednesday, he'd been pronounced the Most Dangerous\nStudent in the Classroom... Thursday, let's not even think about\nThursday... Friday, the Incident in Potions Class, followed by his\nblackmailing the Headmaster, followed by the Defense Professor\nhaving him beaten up in class, followed by the Defense Professor\nturning out to be the most awesome human being who still walked the\nface of the Earth... Saturday he'd lost a bet and gone on his first\ndate and started redeeming Draco... and then this morning Professor\nTrelawney's unheard prophecy might or might not indicate that an\nimmortal Dark Lord was about to attack Hogwarts.",
      "Harry mentally organized his material, and started writing.",
      "Dear Mum and Dad:",
      "Hogwarts is lots of fun. I learned how to violate the Second\nLaw of Thermodynamics in Charms class, and I met a girl named\nHermione Granger who reads faster than I do.",

He'd practiced Transfiguration over and\nover during one of his extra hours every day, taking the other hour\nfor beginning Occlumency. He was taking the worthwhile classes\nseriously, not just turning in his homework every day, but\nusing his free time to learn more than was required, to read other\nbooks beyond the given textbooks, looking to master the subject and\nnot just memorize a few test answers, to excel. You didn't see that\nmuch outside Ravenclaw. And now even within Ravenclaw, his\nonly remaining competitors were Padma Patil (whose parents came\nfrom a non-English-speaking culture and thus had raised her with an\nactual work ethic), Anthony Goldstein (out of a certain tiny ethnic\ngroup that won 25% of the Nobel Prizes), and of course, striding\nfar above everyone like a Titan strolling through a pack of\npuppies, Hermione Granger.",
      "To run this particular experiment you needed the test subject to\nlearn sixteen new spells, on their own, without help or correction.\nThat meant the test subject was Hermione. Period.",

      "\"AAAAAAAAARRRRRRGHHHH!\u202f\"",
      "Thud. Thud. Thud.",
      "Harry had thought about the nature of magic for a while, and\nthen designed a series of experiments based on the premise that\nvirtually everything wizards believed about magic was wrong.",
      "You couldn't really need to say 'Wingardium Leviosa' in\nexactly the right way in order to levitate something, because, come\non, 'Wingardium Leviosa'? The universe was going to check that you\nsaid 'Wingardium Leviosa' in exactly the right way and otherwise it\nwouldn't make the quill float?",
      "No. Obviously no, once you thought about it seriously. Someone,\nquite possibly an actual preschool child, but at any rate some\nEnglish-speaking magic user, who thought that 'Wingardium Leviosa'\nsounded all flyish and floaty, had originally spoken those words\nwhile casting the spell for the first time. And then told everyone\nelse it was necessary.",
      "But (Harry had reasoned) it didn't have to be that way,\nit wasn't built into the universe, it was built into\nyou.",
      "There was an old story passed down among scientists, a\ncautionary tale, the story of Blondlot and the N-Rays.",
      "Shortly after the discovery of X-Rays, an eminent French\nphysicist named Prosper-Rene Blondlot - who had been first to\nmeasure the speed of radio waves and show that they propagated at\nthe speed of light - had announced the discovery of an amazing new\nphenomenon, N-Rays, which would induce a faint brightening of a\nscreen. You had to look hard to see it, but it was there. N-Rays\nhad all sorts of interesting properties. They were bent by\naluminium and could be focused by an aluminium prism into striking\na treated thread of cadmium sulfide, which would then glow faintly\nin the dark...",
      "Soon dozens of other scientists had confirmed Blondlot's\nresults, especially in France.",
      "But there were still other scientists, in England and Germany,\nwho said they weren't quite sure they could see that faint\nglow.",
      "Blondlot had said they were probably setting up the machinery\nwrong.",
      "One day Blondlot had given a demonstration of N-Rays. The lights\nhad turned out, and his assistant had called off the brightening\nand darkening as Blondlot performed his manipulations.",
      "It had been a normal demonstration, all the results going as\nexpected.",
      "Even though an American scientist named Robert Wood had quietly\nstolen the aluminium prism from the center of Blondlot's\nmechanism.",
      "And that had been the end of N-Rays.",
      "Reality, Philip K. Dick had once said, is that\nwhich, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away.",
      "Blondlot's sin had been obvious in retrospect. He shouldn't have\ntold his assistant what he was doing. Blondlot should have made\nsure the assistant didn't know what was being tried or\nwhen it was being tried, before asking him to describe the screen's\nbrightness. It could have been that simple.",
      "Nowadays it was called \"blinding\" and it was one of the things\nmodern scientists took for granted. If you were doing a psychology\nexperiment to see whether people got angrier when they were hit\nover the head with red truncheons than with green truncheons, you\ndidn't get to look at the subjects yourself and decide how \"angry\"\nthey were. You would snap photos of them after they'd been hit with\nthe truncheon, and send the photos off to a panel of raters, who\nwould rate on a scale of 1 to 10 how angry each person looked,\nobviously without knowing what color of truncheon they'd\nbeen hit with. Indeed there was no good reason to tell the raters\nwhat the experiment was about, at all. You certainly\nwouldn't tell the experimental subjects that you thought\nthey ought to be angrier when hit by red truncheons. You'd just\noffer them 20 pounds, lure them into a test room, hit them with a\ntruncheon, color randomly assigned of course, and snap the photo.\nIn fact the truncheon-hitting and photo-snapping would be done by\nan assistant who hadn't been told about the hypothesis, so he\ncouldn't look expectant, hit harder, or snap the photo at just the\nright time.",
      "Blondlot had destroyed his reputation with the sort of mistake\nthat would get a failing grade and probably derisive laughter from\nthe T.A. in a first-year undergraduate course on experimental\ndesign... in 1991.",
      "But this had been a bit longer ago, in 1904, and so it had taken\nmonths before Robert Wood had formulated the obvious alternative\nhypothesis and figured out how to test it, and dozens of other\nscientists had been sucked in.",
      "More than two centuries after science had gotten started. That\nlate in scientific history, it still hadn't been obvious.",
      "Which made it entirely plausible that in the tiny\nwizarding world, where science didn't seem much known at all, no\none had ever tried the first, the simplest, the most obvious thing\nthat any modern scientist would think to check.",
      "The books were full of complicated instructions for all the\nthings you had to do exactly right in order to cast a\nspell. And, Harry had hypothesized, the process of obeying those\ninstructions, of checking that you were following them correctly,\nprobably did do something. It forced you to\nconcentrate on the spell. Being told to just wave your wand\nand wish probably wouldn't work as well. And once you\nbelieved the spell was supposed to work a certain way, once you had\npracticed it that way, you might not be able to convince yourself\nthat it could work any other way...",
      "...if you did the simple but wrong thing, and tried to test\nalternative forms yourself.",
      "But what if you didn't know what the original spell had\nbeen like?",
      "What if you gave Hermione a list of spells she hadn't studied\nyet, taken from a book of silly prank spells in the Hogwarts\nlibrary, and some of those spells had the correct and original\ninstructions, while others had one changed gesture, one changed\nword? What if you kept the instructions constant, but told her that\na spell supposed to create a red worm was supposed to create a blue\nworm instead?",
      "Well, in that case, it had turned out...",
      "...Harry was having trouble believing his results here...",
      "...if you told Hermione to say \"Oogely boogely\" with the vowel\ndurations in the ratio of 3 to 1 to 1, instead of the correct ratio\nof 3 to 1 to 2, you still got the bat but it wouldn't glow any\nmore.",
      "Not that belief was irrelevant here. Not that\nonly the words and wand movements mattered.",
      "If you gave Hermione completely incorrect information about what\na spell was supposed to do, it would stop working.",
      "If you didn't tell her at all what the spell was supposed to do,\nit would stop working.",
      "If she knew in very vague terms what the spell was supposed to\ndo, or she was only partially wrong, then the spell would work as\noriginally described in the book, not the way she'd been told it\nshould.",
      "Harry was, at this moment, literally banging his head against\nthe brick wall. Not hard. He didn't want to damage his precious\nbrains. But if he didn't have some outlet for his frustration, he\nwould spontaneously catch on fire.",
      "Thud. Thud. Thud.",
      "It seemed the universe actually did want you to say\n'Wingardium Leviosa' and it wanted you to say it in a certain exact\nway and it didn't care what you thought the pronunciation\nshould be any more than it cared how you felt about gravity.",

      "So Harry had explained to her what they were testing.",
      "Harry had explained why they were testing it.",
      "Harry had explained why probably no wizard had tried it before\nthem.",
      "Harry had explained that he was actually fairly confident of his\nprediction.",
      "Because, Harry had said, there was no way that the\nuniverse actually wanted you to say 'Wingardium Leviosa'.",
      "Hermione had pointed out that this was not what her books said.\nHermione had asked if Harry really thought he was smarter, at\neleven years old and just over a month into his Hogwarts education,\nthan all the other wizards in the world who disagreed with him.",

      "\"Of course.\"",
      "Now Harry was staring at the red brick directly in front of him\nand contemplating how hard he would have to hit his head in order\nto give himself a concussion that would interfere with long-term\nmemory formation and prevent him from remembering this later.\nHermione wasn't laughing, but he could feel her intent to\nlaugh radiating out from behind him like a dreadful pressure\non his skin, sort of like knowing you were being stalked by a\nserial killer only worse.",
      "\"Say it,\" Harry said.",
      "\"I wasn't going to,\" said the kindly voice of Hermione\nGranger. \"It didn't seem nice.\"",
      "\"Just get it over with,\" said Harry.",
      "\"Okay! So you gave me this whole long lecture about how\nhard it was to do basic science and how we might need to stay on\nthe problem for thirty-five years, and then you went and\nexpected us to make the greatest discovery in the history of magic\nin the first hour we were working together.

      "Over the last month, Harry had carefully worked out, in advance,\na course of experimentation for them that would have lasted until\nDecember.",
      "It would have been a great set of experiments if the\nvery first test had not falsified the basic premise.",
      "Harry could not believe he had been this dumb.",
      "\"Let me correct myself,\" said Harry. \"I need to design\none new experiment. I'll let you know when we've got it,\nand we'll do it, and then I'll design the next one. How does that\nsound?\"",
      "\"It sounds like someone wasted a whole lot of\neffort.\"",
      "Thud. Ow. He'd done that a bit harder than he'd\nplanned.",
      "\"So,\" said Hermione. She was leaning back in her chair and the\nsmug look was back on her face. \"What did we discover today?\"",
      "\"I discovered,\" said Harry through gritted teeth, \"that when it\ncomes to doing truly basic research on a genuinely confusing\nproblem where you have no clue what's going on, my books on\nscientific methodology aren't worth crap -\"",
      "\"Language, Mr. Potter! Some of us are innocent young girls!\"",
      "\"Fine. But if my books were worth a carp, that's a kind\nof fish not anything bad, they would have given me the following\nimportant piece of advice: When there's a confusing problem and\nyou're just starting out and you have a falsifiable hypothesis, go\ntest it. Find some simple, easy way of doing a basic check and do\nit right away. Don't worry about designing an elaborate course of\nexperiments that would make a grant proposal look impressive to a\nfunding agency. Just check as fast as possible whether your ideas\nare false before you start investing huge amounts of effort in\nthem. How does that sound for a moral?\"",
      "\"Mmm... okay,\" said Hermione. \"But I was also hoping for\nsomething like 'Hermione's books aren't worthless. They're written\nby wise old wizards who know way more about magic than I do. I\nshould pay attention to what Hermione's books say.' Can we have\nthat moral too?\"",
      "Harry's jaw seemed to be clenched too tightly to let any words\nout, so he just nodded.",
      "\"Great!\" Hermione said. \"I liked this experiment. We learned a\nlot from it and it only took me an hour or so.\"",

      "Harry Potter, judging by the expression on his face, didn't seem\nto have any doubts on the appropriate mood.",
      "Harry Potter looked like he was ready to kill someone.",
      "\"Hermione Granger,\" said Harry Potter, just as Draco was opening\nhis mouth. \"Don't ask.\"",
      "He couldn't have gone on another date, could he?\nthought Draco, but that didn't make any sense.",
      "\"Harry,\" said Draco, \"I'm sorry but I have to ask this anyway,\ndid you really order the mudblood girl an expensive\nmokeskin pouch for her birthday?\"",
      "\"Yes, I did. You've already worked out why, of course.\"",
      "Draco reached up and raked fingers through his hair in\nfrustration, his cowl brushing the back of his hand. He\nhadn't been quite sure why, but now he couldn't say so.\nAnd Slytherin knew he was courting Harry Potter, he'd made\nit obvious enough in Defense class. \"Harry,\" said Draco, \"people\nknow I'm friends with you, they don't know about the Conspiracy of\ncourse, but they know we're friends, and it makes me look\nbad when you do that sort of thing.\"",
      "Harry Potter's face tightened. \"Anyone in Slytherin who can't\nunderstand the concept of acting nice toward people you don't\nactually like should be ground up and fed to pet snakes.\"",
      "\"There are a lot of people in Slytherin who don't,\"\nDraco said, his voice serious. \"Most people are stupid, and you\nhave to look good in front of them anyway.\" Harry Potter\nhad to understand that if he ever wanted to get anywhere\nin life.",
      "\"What do you care what other people think? Are you\nreally going to live your life needing to explain everything you do\nto the dumbest idiots in Slytherin, letting them judge\nyou? I'm sorry, Draco, but I'm not lowering my cunning\nplots to the level of what the dumbest Slytherins can understand,\njust because it might make you look bad otherwise. Not even your\nfriendship is worth that. It would take all the fun out of\nlife. Tell me you haven't ever thought the same thing\nwhen someone in Slytherin is being too stupid to breathe, that it's\nbeneath the dignity of a Malfoy to have to pander to them.\"",
      "Draco genuinely hadn't. Ever. Pandering to idiots was like\nbreathing, you did it without thinking about it.",
      "\"Harry,\" Draco said at last. \"Just doing whatever you want,\nwithout worrying about how it looks, isn't smart. The Dark\nLord worried about how he looked! He was feared and hated, and\nhe knew exactly what sort of fear and hate he wanted to\ncreate. Everyone has to worry about what other people\nthink.\"",
      "The cowled figure shrugged. \"Perhaps. Remind me sometime to tell\nyou about something called Asch's Conformity Experiment, you might\nfind it quite amusing. For now I'll just note that it's dangerous\nto worry about what other people think on instinct,\nbecause you actually care, not as a matter of cold-blooded\ncalculation. Remember, I was beaten and bullied by older Slytherins\nfor fifteen minutes, and afterward I stood up and graciously\nforgave them. Just like the good and virtuous Boy-Who-Lived ought\nto do. But my cold-blooded calculations, Draco, tell me that I have\nno use for the dumbest idiots in Slytherin, since I\ndon't own a pet snake. So I have no reason to care what they\nthink about how I conduct my duel with Hermione Granger.\"",
      "Draco did not clench his fists in frustration. \"She's just some\nmudblood,\" Draco said, keeping his voice calm, rather than\nshouting. \"If you don't like her, push her down the stairs.\"",
      "\"Ravenclaw would know -\"",
      "\"Have Pansy Parkinson push her down the stairs! You wouldn't\neven have to manipulate her, offer her a Sickle and she'd do\nit!\"",
      "\"I would know! Hermione beat me in a book-reading\ncontest, she's getting better grades than me, I have to defeat her\nwith my brain or it doesn't count!\"",
      "\"She's just a mudblood! Why do you respect her that\nmuch?\u202f\"",
      "\"She's a power among Ravenclaws! Why do you care what some\npowerless idiot in Slytherin thinks?\u202f\"",
      "\"It's called politics! And if you can't play it you can't\nhave power!\u202f\"",
      "\"Walking on the moon is power! Being a great wizard is\npower! There are kinds of power that don't require me to spend the\nrest of my life pandering to morons!\u202f\"",
      "Both of them stopped, and, in almost perfect unison, began\ntaking deep breaths to calm themselves.",
      "\"Sorry,\" Harry Potter said after a few moments, wiping sweat\nfrom his forehead. \"Sorry, Draco. You've got a lot of political\npower and it makes sense for you to keep it. You should be\ncalculating what Slytherin thinks. It's an important game and I\nshouldn't have insulted it. But you can't ask me to lower\nthe level of my game in Ravenclaw, just so that you don't look bad\nby associating with me. Tell Slytherin you're gritting your teeth\nwhile you pretend to be my friend.\"",
      "That was exactly what Draco had told Slytherin, and he\nstill wasn't sure whether it was true.",
      "\"Anyway,\" Draco said. \"Speaking of your image. I'm afraid I've\ngot some bad news. Rita Skeeter heard some of the stories about you\nand she's been asking questions.\"",
      "Harry Potter raised his eyebrows. \"Who?\"",
      "\"She writes for the Daily Prophet,\" Draco said. He\ntried to keep the worry out of his voice. The Daily\nProphet was one of Father's primary tools, he used it like a\nwizard's wand. \"That's the newspaper people actually pay attention\nto. Rita Skeeter writes about celebrities, and as she puts it, uses\nher quill to puncture their over-inflated reputations. If she can't\nfind any rumors about you, she'll just make up her own.\"",
      "\"I see,\" said Harry Potter. His green-lit face looked\nvery thoughtful beneath the cowl.",
      "Draco hesitated before saying what he had to say next. By now\nsomeone had certainly reported to Father that he was courting Harry\nPotter, and Father would also know that Draco hadn't written home\nabout it, and Father would understand that Draco didn't think he\ncould actually keep it a secret, which sent a clear message that\nDraco was practicing his own game now but still on Father's side,\nsince if Draco had been tempted away, he would have been sending\nfalse reports.",
      "It followed that Father had probably anticipated what Draco was\nabout to say next.",
      "Playing the game with Father for real was a rather unnerving\nsensation. Even if they were on the same side. It was, on the one\nhand, exhiliarating, but Draco also knew that in the end it would\nturn out that Father had played the game better. There was no other\nway it could possibly go.",
      "\"Harry,\" Draco finally said. \"This isn't a suggestion. This\nisn't my advice. Just the way it is. My father could almost\ncertainly quash that article. But it would cost you.\"",
      "That Father had been expecting Draco to tell Harry Potter\nexactly that was not something Draco said out loud. Harry Potter\nwould work it out on his own, or not.",
      "But instead Harry Potter shook his head, smiling beneath the\ncowl. \"I have no intention of trying to quash Rita Skeeter.\"",
      "Draco didn't even try to keep the incredulity out of his voice.\n\"You can't tell me you don't care what the\nnewspaper says about you!\"",
      "\"I care less than you might think,\" said Harry Potter. \"But I\nhave my own ways of dealing with the likes of Skeeter. I don't need\nLucius's help.\"",
      "A worried look came over Draco's face before he could stop it.\nWhatever Harry Potter was about to do next, it would be something\nFather wasn't expecting, and Draco was feeling very nervous about\nwhere that might lead.",
      "Draco also realized that his hair was getting sweaty underneath\nthe cowl. He'd never actually worn one of those before, and hadn't\nrealized that the Death Eaters' cloaks probably had things like\nCooling Charms.",
      "Harry Potter wiped some sweat from his forehead again, grimaced,\ntook out his wand, pointed it upward, took a deep breath, and said\n\"Frigideiro!\u202f\"",
      "Moments later Draco felt the cold draft.",
      "\"Frigideiro! Frigideiro! Frigideiro! Frigideiro!\nFrigideiro!\u202f\"",
      "Then Harry Potter lowered the wand, though his hand seemed a bit\nshaky, and put it back into his robes.",
      "The whole room seemed perceptibly cooler. Draco could have done\nthat too, but still, not bad.",
      "\"So,\" Draco said. \"Science. You're going to tell me about\nblood.\"",
      "\"We're going to find out about blood,\" Harry Potter\nsaid. \"By doing experiments.\"",
      "\"All right,\" Draco said. \"What sort of experiments?\"",
      "Harry Potter smiled evilly beneath his cowl, and said, \"You tell\nme.\"",
      "Draco had heard of something called the Socratic Method, which\nwas teaching by asking questions (named after an ancient\nphilosopher who had been too smart to be a real Muggle and hence\nhad been a disguised pureblood wizard). One of his tutors had used\nSocratic teaching a lot. It had been annoying but effective.",
      "Then there was the Potter Method, which was insane.",
      "To be fair, Draco had to admit that Harry Potter had tried the\nSocratic Method first and it hadn't been working too well.",
      "Harry Potter had asked how Draco would go about\ndisproving the blood purist hypothesis that wizards\ncouldn't do the neat stuff now that they'd done eight centuries ago\nbecause they had interbred with Muggleborns and Squibs.",
      "Draco had said that he did not understand how Harry Potter could\nsit there with a straight face and claim this was not a trap.",
      "Harry Potter had replied, still with a straight face, that if it\nwas a trap it would have been so pathetically obvious that\nhe ought to be ground up and fed to pet snakes, but it was\nnot a trap, it was simply a rule of how scientists\noperated that you had to try to disprove your own theories, and if\nyou made an honest effort and failed, that was victory.",
      "Draco had tried to point out the staggering stupidity of this by\nsuggesting that the key to surviving a duel was to cast Avada\nKedavra on your own foot and miss.",
      "Harry Potter had nodded.",
      "Draco had shaken his head.",
      "Harry Potter had then presented the idea that scientists watched\nideas fight to see which ones won, and you couldn't fight\nwithout an opponent, so Draco needed to figure out opponents\nfor the blood purist hypothesis to fight so that blood purism could\nwin, which Draco understood a little better even though Harry\nPotter had said it with a rather distasteful look. Like, it was\nclear that if blood purism was the way the world really was, then\nthe sky just had to be blue, and if some other theory was true, the\nsky just had to be green; and nobody had seen the sky yet; and then\nyou went outside and looked and the blood purists won; and after\nthis had happened six times in a row, people would start noticing\nthe trend.",
      "Harry Potter had then proceeded to claim that all the opponents\nDraco was inventing were too weak, so blood purism wouldn't get\ncredit for defeating them because the battle wouldn't be impressive\nenough. Draco had understood that too. Wizards have gotten\nweaker because house elves are stealing our magic hadn't\nsounded impressive to him either.",
      "(Though Harry Potter had said that one at least was\ntestable, in that they could try to check if house elves had gotten\nstronger over time, and even draw a picture representing the\nincreasing strength of house elves and another picture representing\nthe decreasing strength of wizards and if the two pictures matched\nthat would point to the house elves, all said in such completely\nserious tones that Draco had felt an impulse to ask Dobby a few\npointed questions under Veritaserum before snapping out of it.)",
      "And Harry Potter had finally said that Draco couldn't\nfix the battle, scientists weren't dumb, it would be\nobvious if you fixed the battle, it had to be a real\nfight, between two different theories that might both\nreally be true, with a test that only the true\nhypothesis would win, something that actually would come\nout different ways depending on which hypothesis was actually\ncorrect, and there would be experienced scientists watching to make\nsure that was exactly what happened. Harry Potter had claimed that\nhe himself just wanted to know how blood really worked and\nfor that he need to see blood purism really win and Draco\nwasn't going to fool him with theories that were just\nthere to be knocked down.",
      "Even having seen the point, Draco hadn't been able to invent any\n\"plausible alternatives\", as Harry Potter put it, to the idea that\nwizards were getting less powerful because they were mixing their\nblood with mud. It was too obviously true.",
      "It was then that Harry Potter had said, rather frustrated, that\nhe couldn't imagine Draco was really this bad at\nconsidering different viewpoints, surely there'd been\nDeath Eaters who'd posed as enemies of blood purism and had come up\nwith much more plausible-sounding arguments against their own side\nthan Draco was offering. If Draco had been trying to pose as a\nmember of Dumbledore's faction, and come up with the house elf\nhypothesis, he wouldn't have fooled anyone for a second.",
      "Draco had been forced to admit this was a point.",
      "Hence the Potter Method.",
      "\"Please, Dr. Malfoy,\" whined Harry Potter, \"why won't you accept\nmy paper?\"",
      "Harry Potter had needed to repeat the phrase \"just pretend to be\npretending to be a scientist\" three times before Draco had\nunderstood.",
      "In that moment Draco had realized that there was something\ndeeply wrong with Harry Potter's brain, and anyone who\ntried Legilimency on it would probably never come back out\nagain.",
      "Harry Potter had then gone into further and considerable detail:\nDraco was to pretend to be a Death Eater who was posing as the\neditor of a scientific journal, Dr. Malfoy, who wanted to reject\nhis enemy Dr. Potter's paper \"On the Heritability of Magical\nAbility\", and if the Death Eater didn't act like a real scientist\nwould, he would be revealed as a Death Eater and executed, while\nDr. Malfoy was also being watched by his own rivals and needed to\nappear to reject Dr. Potter's paper for neutral scientific\nreasons or he would lose his position as journal editor.",
      "It was a wonder the Sorting Hat wasn't gibbering madly in St.\nMungo's.",
      "It was also the most complicated thing anyone had ever\nasked Draco to pretend and there was no possible way he could have\nrefused the challenge.",
      "Right now they were, as Harry Potter had put it, getting in the\nmood.",
      "\"I'm afraid, Dr. Potter, that you wrote this in the wrong color\nof ink,\" Draco said. \"Next!\"",
      "Dr. Potter's face did an excellent job of crumpling in despair,\nand Draco couldn't help but feel a flash of Dr. Malfoy's glee, even\nthough the Death Eater was only pretending to be Dr. Malfoy.",
      "This part was fun. He could have done this all day\nlong.",
      "Dr. Potter got up from the chair, slumped over in dismay, and\ntrudged off, and turned into Harry Potter, who gave Draco a\nthumbs-up, and then turned back into Dr. Potter again, now\napproaching with an eager smile.",
      "Dr. Potter sat down and presented Dr. Malfoy with a piece of\nparchment on which was written:",
      "On the Heritability of Magical\nAbility",
      "Dr. H. J. Potter-Evans-Verres,\nInstitute for Sufficiently Advanced Science",
      "My observation:",
      "Today's wizards can't do things\nas impressive as\nwhat wizards used to do 800 years ago.",
      "My conclusion:",
      "Wizardkind has become weaker by\nmixing\ntheir blood with Muggleborns and Squibs.",
      "\"Dr. Malfoy,\" said Dr. Potter with a hopeful look, \"I was\nwondering if the Journal of Irreproducible Results could\nconsider for publication my paper entitled 'On the Heritability of\nMagical Ability'.\"",
      "Draco looked at the parchment, smiling while he considered\npossible rejections. If he was a professor, he would have refused\nthe essay as too short, so -",
      "\"It's too long, Dr. Potter,\" said Dr. Malfoy.",
      "For a moment there was genuine incredulity on Dr. Potter's\nface.",
      "\"Ah...\" said Dr. Potter. \"How about if I get rid of the separate\nlines for observations and conclusions, and just put in a\ntherefore -\"",
      "\"Then it'll be too short. Next!\"",
      "Dr. Potter trudged off.",
      "\"All right,\" said Harry Potter, \"you're getting too\ngood at this. Two more times to practice, and then third time is\nfor real, no interruptions between, I'll just come in straight at\nyou and that time you'll reject the paper based on the actual\ncontent, remember, your scientific rivals are watching.\"",
      "Dr. Potter's next paper was perfect in every way, a marvel of\nits kind, but unfortunately had to be rejected because Dr. Malfoy's\njournal was having trouble with the letter E. Dr. Potter offered to\nrewrite it without those words, and Dr. Malfoy explained that it\nwas really more of a vowel problem.",
      "The paper after that was rejected because it was Tuesday.",
      "It was, in fact, Saturday.",
      "Dr. Potter tried to point this out and was told \"Next!\"",
      "(Draco was starting to understand why Snape had used his hold\nover Dumbledore just to get a position that let him be awful to\nstudents.)",
      "And then -",
      "Dr. Potter was approaching with a superior smirk on his\nface.",
      "\"This is my latest paper, On the Heritability of Magical\nAbility,\" Dr. Potter stated confidently, and thrust out the\nparchment. \"I have decided to allow your journal to publish it, and\nhave prepared it in perfect accordance with your guidelines so that\nyou may publish it quickly.\"",
      "The Death Eater decided to track down and kill Dr. Potter after\nhis mission was done. Dr. Malfoy kept a polite smile on his face,\nsince his rivals were watching, and said...",
      "(The pause stretched, with Dr. Potter looking at him\nimpatiently.)",
      "...\"Let me look at that, please.\"",
      "Dr. Malfoy took the parchment and perused it carefully.",
      "The Death Eater was starting to get nervous about the fact that\nhe wasn't a real scientist, and Draco was trying to remember how to\ntalk like Harry Potter.",
      "\"You, ah, need to consider other possible explanations for your,\num, observation, besides just this one -\"",
      "\"Really?\" interrupted Dr. Potter. \"Like what, exactly? House\nelves are stealing our magic? My data admit of only one\npossible conclusion, Dr. Malfoy. There are no other\nplausible hypotheses.\"",
      "Draco was trying furiously to order his brain to think, what\nwould he say if he was posing as a member of Dumbledore's faction,\nwhat did they claim was the explanation for wizardkind's\ndecline, Draco had never bothered to actually ask that...",
      "\"If you can't think of any other way to explain my data, you'll\nhave to publish my paper, Dr. Malfoy.\"",
      "It was the sneer on Dr. Potter's face that did it.",
      "\"Oh yeah?\" snapped Dr. Malfoy. \"How do you know that magic\nitself isn't fading away?\"",
      "Time stopped.",
      "Draco and Harry Potter exchanged looks of appalled horror.",
      "Then Harry Potter spat something that was probably an extremely\nbad word if you'd been raised by Muggles. \"I didn't think of\nthat!\u202f\" said Harry Potter. \"And I should have. The magic goes\naway. Damn, damn, damn!\u202f\"",
      "The alarm in Harry Potter's voice was contagious. Without even\nthinking about it, Draco's hand went into his robes and clutched at\nhis wand. He'd thought the House of Malfoy was safe, so\nlong as you only married into families that could trace their\nbloodlines back four generations you were supposed to be\nsafe, it had never occurred to him before that there might\nbe nothing anyone could do to stop the end of magic. \"Harry, what\ndo we do?\" Draco's voice was rising in panic. \"What do we\ndo?\u202f\"",
      "\"Let me think!\u202f\"",
      "After a few moments, Harry grabbed from a nearby desk the same\nquill and roll of parchment he'd used to write his pretend paper,\nand started scribbling something.",
      "\"We'll figure it out,\" Harry said, his voice tight, \"if magic is\nfading out of the world we'll figure out how fast it's fading and\nhow much time we have left to do something, and then we'll figure\nout why it's fading, and then we'll do something about it. Draco,\nhave wizarding powers been declining at a steady rate, or have\nthere been sudden drops?\"",
      "\"I... I don't know...\"",
      "\"You told me that no one had matched the four founders of\nHogwarts. So it's been going on for at least eight centuries, then?\nYou can't remember hearing anything about the problems suddenly\nappearing five centuries ago or anything like that?\"",
      "Draco was trying frantically to think. \"I always heard that\nnobody was as good as Merlin and then after that nobody was as good\nas the Founders of Hogwarts.\"",
      "\"All right,\" Harry said. He was still scribbling. \"Because three\ncenturies ago is when Muggles started to not believe in magic,\nwhich I thought might have something to do with it. And about a\ncentury and a half ago was when Muggles began using a kind of\ntechnology that stops working around magic and I was wondering if\nit might also go the other way around.\"",
      "Draco exploded out of his chair, so angry he could hardly even\nspeak. \"It's the Muggles -\"",
      "\"Damn it!\u202f\" roared Harry. \"Weren't you even listening\nto yourself? It's been going on for eight centuries at\nleast and the Muggles weren't doing anything interesting then!\nWe have to figure out the real truth! The Muggles\nmight have something to do with this but if they\ndon't and you go blaming everything on them and that stops\nus from figuring out what's really going on then one day\nyou're going to wake up in the morning and find out that your wand\nis just a stick of wood!\"",
      "Draco's breath stopped in his throat. His father often said\nour wands will break in our hands in his speeches but\nDraco had never really thought before about what that\nmeant, it wasn't going to happen to him after\nall. And now suddenly it seemed very real. Just a stick of\nwood. Draco could imagine just what it would be like to take\nout his wand and try to cast a spell and find that nothing was\nhappening...",
      "That could happen to everyone.",
      "There would be no more wizards, no more magic, ever. Just\nMuggles who had a few legends about what their ancestors had been\nable to do. Some of the Muggles would be called Malfoy, and that\nwould be all that was left of the name.",
      "For the first time in his life, Draco realized why there were\nDeath Eaters.",
      "He'd always taken for granted that becoming a Death Eater was\nsomething you did when you grew up. Now Draco understood,\nhe knew why Father and Father's friends had sworn to give their\nlives to prevent the nightmare from coming to pass, there were\nthings you couldn't just stand by and watch happen. But what if it\nwas going to happen anyway, what if all the sacrifices,\nall the friends they'd lost to Dumbledore, the family\nthey'd lost, what if it had all been for nothing...",
      "\"Magic can't be fading away,\" Draco said. His voice was\nbreaking. \"It wouldn't be fair.\"",
      "Harry stopped scribbling and looked up. His face had an angry\nexpression. \"Your father never told you that life isn't fair?\"",
      "Father had said that every single time Draco used the word.\n\"But, but, it's too awful to believe that -\"",
      "\"Draco, let me introduce you to something I call the Litany of\nTarski. It changes every time you use it. On this occasion it runs\nlike so: If magic is fading out of the world, I want to believe\nthat magic is fading out of the world. If magic is not fading out\nof the world, I want not to believe that magic is fading out of the\nworld. Let me not become attached to beliefs I may not want.\nIf we're living in a world where magic is fading, that's what\nwe have to believe, we have to know what's coming, so we can\nstop it, or in the very worst case, be prepared to do what we can\nin the time we have left. Not believing it won't stop it from\nhappening. So the only question we have to ask is whether\nmagic is actually fading, and if that's the world we live\nin then that's what we want to believe. Litany of Gendlin:\nWhat's true is already so, owning up to it doesn't make it\nworse. Got that, Draco? I'm going to make you memorize it\nlater. It's something you repeat to yourself any time you start\nwondering if it's a good idea to believe something that isn't\nactually true. In fact I want you to say it right now. What's\ntrue is already so, owning up to it doesn't make it worse. Say\nit.\"",
      "\"What's true is already so,\" repeated Draco, his voice\ntrembling, \"owning up to it doesn't make it worse.\"",
      "\"If magic is fading, I want to believe that magic is fading. If\nmagic is not fading, I want not to believe that magic is fading.\nSay it.\"",
      "Draco repeated back the words, the sickness churning in his\nstomach.",
      "\"Good,\" Harry said, \"remember, it might not be\nhappening, and then you won't have to believe it, either.\nFirst we just want to know what's actually going on, which\nworld we actually live in.\" Harry turned back to his work,\nscribbled some more, and then turned the parchment so Draco could\nsee it. Draco leaned over the desk and Harry brought the green\nlight closer.",
      "Observation:",
      "Wizardry isn't as powerful now as it was when Hogwarts was\nfounded.",
      "Hypotheses:",
      "1. Magic itself is fading.\n2. Wizards are interbreeding with Muggles and Squibs.\n3. Knowledge to cast powerful spells is being lost.\n4. Wizards are eating the wrong foods as children, or something\nelse besides blood is making them grow up weaker.\n5. Muggle technology is interfering with magic. (Since 800 years\nago?)\n6. Stronger wizards are having fewer children. (Draco = only child?\nCheck if 3 powerful wizards, Quirrell / Dumbledore / Dark Lord, had\nany children.)",
      "Tests:",
      "\"All right,\" Harry said. His breathing sounded a little calmer.\n\"Now when you're dealing with a confusing problem and you have no\nidea what's going on, the smart thing to do is figure out some\nreally simple tests, things you can look at right away. We need\nfast tests that distinguish between these hypotheses. Observations\nthat would come out a different way for at least one of them\ncompared to all the other ones.\"",
      "Draco stared at the list in shock. He was suddenly realizing\nthat he knew an awful lot of purebloods who were only children.\nHimself, Vincent, Gregory, practically everyone. The two\nmost powerful wizards everyone talked about were Dumbledore and the\nDark Lord and neither had any children just like Harry had\nsuspected...",
      "\"It's going to be really hard to distinguish between 2 and 6,\"\nHarry said, \"it's in the blood either way, you'd have to try and\ntrack the decline of wizardry and compare that to how many kids\ndifferent wizards were having and measure the abilities of\nMuggleborns compared to purebloods...\" Harry's fingers were tapping\nnervously on the desk. \"Let's just lump 6 in with 2 and call them\nthe blood hypothesis for now. 4 is unlikely because then everyone\nwould notice a sudden drop when the wizards switched to new foods,\nit's hard to see what would've changed steadily over 800 years. 5\nis unlikely for the same reason, no sudden drop, Muggles weren't\ndoing anything 800 years back. 4 looks like 2 and 5 looks like 1\nanyway. So mainly we should be trying to distinguish between 1, 2,\nand 3.\" Harry turned the parchment to himself, drew an ellipse\naround those three numbers, turned it back. \"Magic is fading, blood\nis weakening, knowledge is disappearing. What test comes out\ndifferently depending on which of those is true? What could we see\nthat would mean any one of these was false?\"",
      "\"I don't know!\" blurted Draco. \"Why are you asking me?\nYou're the scientist!\"",
      "\"Draco,\" Harry said, a note of pleading desperation in his\nvoice, \"I only know what Muggle scientists know! You grew up in the\nwizarding world, I didn't! You know more magic than I do and you\nknow more about magic than I do and you thought of this\nwhole idea in the first place, so start thinking like a scientist\nand solve this!\"",
      "Draco swallowed hard and stared at the paper.",
      "Magic is fading... wizards are interbreeding with Muggles...\nknowledge is being lost...",
      "\"What does the world look like if magic is fading?\" said Harry\nPotter. \"You know more about magic, you should be the one guessing\nnot me! Imagine you're telling a story about it, what happens in\nthe story?\"",
      "Draco imagined it. \"Charms that used to work stop working.\"\nWizards wake up and find that their wands are sticks of\nwood...",
      "\"What does the world look like if the wizarding blood gets\nweaker?\"",
      "\"People can't do things their ancestors could do.\"",
      "\"What does the world look like if knowledge is being lost?\"",
      "\"People don't know how to cast the Charms in the first place...\"\nsaid Draco. He stopped, surprised at himself. \"That's a test, isn't\nit?\"",
      "Harry nodded decisively. \"That's one.\" He wrote it down on the\nparchment under Tests:",
      "A. Are there spells we know but can't cast (1 or 2) or are\nthe lost spells no longer known (3)?",
      "\"So that distinguishes between 1 and 2 on the one hand, and 3 on\nthe other hand,\" said Harry. \"Now we need some way to distinguish\nbetween 1 and 2. Magic fading, blood weakening, how could we tell\nthe difference?\"",
      "\"What kind of Charms did students used to cast in their first\nyear at Hogwarts?\" said Draco. \"If they used to be able to cast\nmuch more powerful Charms, the blood was stronger -\"",
      "Harry Potter shook his head. \"Or magic itself was stronger. We\nhave to figure out some way of telling the difference.\"\nHarry stood up from his chair, began pacing nervously through the\nclassroom. \"No, wait, that might still work. Suppose different\nspells use up different amounts of magical energy. Then if the\nambient magic weakened, the powerful spells would die first, but\nthe spells everyone learns in their first year would stay the\nsame...\" Harry's nervous pacing sped up. \"It's not a very good\ntest, it's more about powerful wizardry being lost versus all\nwizardry being lost, someone's blood could be too weak for powerful\nwizardry but strong enough for easy spells... Draco, do you know if\nmore powerful wizards within a single era, like powerful\nwizards from just this century, are more powerful as children? If\nthe Dark Lord had cast the Cooling Charm when he was eleven, could\nhe have frozen the whole room?\"",
      "Draco's face screwed up as he tried to recollect. \"I can't\nremember hearing anything about the Dark Lord but I think\nDumbledore's supposed to have done something amazing on his\nTransfiguration O.W.L.s in fifth year... I think other powerful\nwizards were good in Hogwarts too...\"",
      "Harry scowled, still pacing. \"They could just be studying hard.\nStill, if first-year students learned the same spells and seemed\nabout as powerful then as now, we could call that weak\nevidence favoring 1 over 2... wait, hold on.\" Harry stopped where\nhe stood. \"I have another test that might distinguish between 1 and\n2. It would take a while to explain, it uses some things that\nscientists know about blood and inheritance, but it's an easy\nquestion to ask. And if we combine my test and your test\nand they both come out the same way, that's a strong hint at the\nanswer.\" Harry almost ran back to the desk, took the parchment and\nwrote:",
      "B. Did ancient first-year students cast the same sort of\nspells, with the same power, as now? (Weak evidence for 1 over 2,\nbut blood could also be losing powerful wizardry only.)",
      "C. Additional test that distinguishes 1 and 2 using\nscientific knowledge of blood, will explain later.",
      "\"Okay,\" said Harry, \"we can at least try to tell the difference\nbetween 1 and 2 and 3, so let's go with this right away, we can\nfigure out more tests after we do the ones we already\nhave. Now it's going to look a little odd if Draco Malfoy and Harry\nPotter go around asking questions together, so here's my idea.\nYou'll go through Hogwarts and find old portraits and ask them\nabout what spells they learned to cast during their first years.\nThey're portraits so they won't know there's anything odd about\nDraco Malfoy doing that. I'll ask recent portraits and living\npeople about spells we know but can't cast, no one will notice\nanything unusual if Harry Potter asks weird questions. And I'll\nhave to do complicated research about forgotten spells, so I want\nyou to be the one to gather the data I need for my own scientific\nquestion. It's a simple question and you should be able to find the\nanswer by asking portraits. You might want to write this down,\nready?\"",
      "Draco sat down again and scrabbled in his bookbag for parchment\nand quill. When it was laid down on the desk, Draco looked up, face\ndetermined. \"Go ahead.\"",
      "\"Find portraits who knew a married Squib couple - don't make\nthat face, Draco, it's important information. Just ask recent\nportraits who are Gryffindors or something. Find portraits who knew\na married Squib couple well enough to know the names of all their\nchildren. Write down the name of each child and whether that child\nwas a wizard, a Squib, or a Muggle. If they don't know whether the\nchild was a Squib or a Muggle, write down 'non-wizard'. Write that\ndown for every child the couple had, don't leave any out.\nIf the portrait only knows the name of the wizarding children, not\nthe names of all the children, then don't write down\nany data from that couple. It's very important that you\nonly bring me data from someone who knows all the children\na Squib couple had, well enough to know them all by name. Try to\nget at least forty names total, if you can, and if you have time\nfor more, even better. Have you got all that?\"",
      "\"Repeat it,\" Draco said, when he was done writing, and Harry\nrepeated it.",
      "\"I've got it,\" Draco said, \"but why -\"",
      "\"It has to do with one of the secrets of blood that scientists\nalready discovered. I'll explain when you get back. Let's split up\nand meet back here in an hour, 6:22pm that should be. Are we ready\nto go?\"",
      "Draco nodded decisively. It was all very rushed, but he'd long\nsince been taught how to rush.",
      "\"Then go!\u202f\" said Harry Potter and yanked off his cowled\ncloak and shoved it into his pouch, which began eating it, and,\nwithout even waiting for his pouch to finish, spun around and began\nstriding rapidly toward the classroom door, bumping into a desk and\nalmost falling over in his haste.",
      "By the time Draco had managed to get his own cloak off and stow\nit in his bookbag, Harry Potter was gone.",
      "Draco almost ran out the door."

      "\"They're no more powerful than the spells we use now.\"",
      "Harry Potter's fist struck a desk, hard. \"Damn it. All right. My\nown experiment was a failure, Draco. There's something called the\nInterdict of Merlin -\"",
      "Draco hit himself on the forehead, realizing.",
      "\"- which stops anyone from getting knowledge of powerful spells\nout of books, even if you find and read a powerful wizard's notes\nthey won't make sense to you, it has to go from one living mind to\nanother. I couldn't find any powerful spells that we had the\ninstructions for but couldn't cast. But if you can't get them out\nof old books, why would anyone bother passing them on by word of\nmouth after they stopped working? Did you get the data on the Squib\ncouples?\"",
      "Draco started to hand the parchment over -",
      "But Harry Potter held up a hand. \"Law of science, Draco. First I\ntell you the theory and the prediction. Then you show me the data.\nThat way you know I'm not just making up a theory to fit; you know\nthat the theory actually predicted the data in advance. I\nhave to explain this to you anyway, so I have to explain it\nbefore you show me the data. That's the rule. So put on\nyour cloak and let's sit down.\"",
      "Harry Potter sat down at a desk with torn scraps of paper\narranged across its surface. Draco drew his cloak out of his\nbookbag, drew it on, and sat down across from Harry on the other\nside, giving the paper scraps a puzzled look. They were arranged in\ntwo rows and the rows were about twenty scraps long.",
      "\"The secret of blood,\" said Harry Potter, an intense look on his\nface, \"is something called deoxyribonucleic acid. You don't say\nthat name in front of anyone who's not a scientist.\nDeoxyribonucleic acid is the recipe that tells your body how to\ngrow, two legs, two arms, short or tall, whether you have brown\neyes or green. It's a material thing, you can see it if\nyou have microscopes, which are like telescopes only they look at\nthings that are very small instead of very far away. And that\nrecipe has two copies of everything, always, in case one copy is\nbroken. Imagine two long rows of pieces of paper. At each place in\nthe row, there are two pieces of paper, and when you have children,\nyour body selects one piece of paper at random from each place in\nthe row, and the mother's body will do the same, and so the child\nalso gets two pieces of paper at each place in the row. Two copies\nof everything, one from your mother, one from your father, and when\nyou have children they get one piece of paper from you at random in\neach place.\"",
      "As Harry spoke, his fingers ranged over the paired scraps of\npaper, pointing to one part of the pair when he said \"from your\nmother\", the other when he said \"from your father\". And as Harry\ntalked about picking a piece of paper at random, his hand pulled a\nKnut out of his robes and flipped it; Harry looked at the coin, and\nthen pointed to the top piece of paper. All without a pause in the\nspeech.",
      "\"Now when it comes to something like being short or tall,\nthere's a lot of places in the recipe that make\nlittle differences. So if a tall father marries a short\nmother, the child gets some pieces of paper saying 'tall' and some\npieces of paper saying 'short', and usually the child ends up\nmiddle-sized. But not always. By luck, the child might get a lot of\npieces saying 'tall', and not many papers saying 'short', and grow\nup pretty tall. You could have a tall father with five papers\nsaying 'tall' and a tall mother with five papers saying 'tall' and\nby amazing luck the child gets all ten papers saying\n'tall' and ends up taller than both of them. You see? Blood isn't a\nperfect fluid, it doesn't mix perfectly. Deoxyribonucleic acid is\nmade up of lots of little pieces, like a glass of pebbles instead\nof a glass of water. That's why a child isn't always exactly in the\nmiddle of the parents.\"",
      "Draco listened with his mouth open. How in Merlin's name had the\nMuggles figured all this out? They could see the\nrecipe?",
      "\"Now,\" Harry Potter said, \"suppose that, just like with\ntallness, there's lots of little places in the recipe where you can\nhave a piece of paper that says 'magic' or 'not magic'. If you have\nenough pieces of paper saying 'magic' you're a wizard, if you have\na lot of pieces of paper you're a powerful wizard, if you\nhave too few you're a Muggle, and in between you're a Squib. Then,\nwhen two Squibs marry, most of the time the children should also be\nSquibs, but once in a while a child will get lucky and get most of\nthe father's magic papers and most of the mother's magic\npapers, and be strong enough to be a wizard. But probably not a\nvery powerful one. If you started out with a lot of powerful\nwizards and they married only each other, they would stay powerful.\nBut if they started marrying Muggleborns who were just barely\nmagical, or Squibs... you see? The blood wouldn't mix perfectly, it\nwould be a glass of pebbles, not a glass of water, because that's\njust the way blood works. There would still be powerful wizards now\nand then, when they got a lot of magic papers by luck. But they\nwouldn't be as powerful as the most powerful wizards from\nearlier.\"",
      "Draco nodded slowly. He'd never heard it explained that way\nbefore. There was a surprising beauty to how exactly it fit.",
      "\"But,\" Harry said. \"That's only one\nhypothesis. Suppose that instead there's only a single\nplace in the recipe that makes you a wizard. Only one\nplace where a piece of paper can say 'magic' or 'not magic'. And\nthere are two copies of everything, always. So then there are only\nthree possibilities. Both copies can say 'magic'. One copy can say\n'magic' and one copy can say 'not magic'. Or both copies can say\n'not magic'. Wizards, Squibs, and Muggles. Two copies and you can\ncast spells, one copy and you can still use potions or magic\ndevices, and zero copies means you might even have trouble looking\nstraight at magic. Muggleborns wouldn't really be born to Muggles,\nthey would be born to two Squibs, two parents each with one magic\ncopy who'd grown up in the Muggle world. Now imagine a witch\nmarries a Squib. Each child will get one paper saying 'magic' from\nthe mother, always, it doesn't matter which piece gets picked at\nrandom, both say 'magic'. But like flipping a coin, half the time\nthe child will get a paper saying 'magic' from the father, and half\nthe time the child will get the father's paper saying 'not magic'.\nWhen a witch marries a Squib, the result won't be a lot of weak\nwizarding children. Half the children will be wizards and witches\njust as powerful as their mother, and half the children will be\nSquibs. Because if there's just one place in the recipe\nthat makes you a wizard, then magic isn't like a glass of pebbles\nthat can mix. It's like a single magical pebble, a sorcerer's\nstone.\"",
      "Harry arranged three pairs of papers side by side. On one pair\nhe wrote 'magic' and 'magic'. On another pair he wrote 'magic' on\nthe top paper only. And the third pair he left blank.",
      "\"In which case,\" Harry said, \"either you have two stones or you\ndon't. Either you're a wizard or not. Powerful wizards would get\nthat way by studying harder and practicing more. And if wizards get\ninherently less powerful, not because of spells being lost\nbut because people can't cast them... then maybe they're eating the\nwrong foods or something. But if it's gotten steadily worse over\neight hundred years, then that could mean magic itself is fading\nout of the world.\"",
      "Harry arranged another two pairs of papers side by side, and\ntook out a quill. Soon each pair had one piece of paper saying\n'magic' and the other paper blank.",
      "\"And that brings me to the prediction,\" said Harry. \"What\nhappens when two Squibs marry. Flip a coin twice. It can come up\nheads and heads, heads and tails, tails and heads, or tails and\ntails. So one quarter of the time you'll get two heads, one quarter\nof the time you'll get two tails, and half the time you'll get one\nheads and one tail. Same thing if two Squibs marry. One quarter of\nthe children would come up magic and magic, and be wizards. One\nquarter would come up not-magic and not-magic, and be Muggles. The\nother half would be Squibs. It's a very old and very classic\npattern. It was discovered by Gregor Mendel who is not forgotten,\nand it was the first hint ever uncovered for how the recipe worked.\nAnyone who knows anything about blood science would recognize that\npattern in an instant. It wouldn't be exact, any more than if you\nflip a coin twice forty times you'll always get exactly ten pairs\nof two heads. But if it's seven or thirteen wizards out of forty\nchildren that'll be a strong indicator. That's the test I had you\ndo. Now let's see your data.\"",

      "Harry's look was fierce. \"Yes you can, because you have to. I\nthought about it myself, too, after I found out about the Interdict\nof Merlin.

      "Draco's mind was just blank.",

      "A. Are there spells we know but can't cast (1 or 2) or are\nthe lost spells no longer known (3)? Result: Inconclusive due to\nInterdict of Merlin. No known uncastable spell, but could simply\nhave not been passed on.",
      "B. Did ancient first-year students cast the same sort of\nspells, with the same power, as now? (Weak evidence for 1 over 2,\nbut blood could also be losing powerful wizardry only.)\nResult: Same level\nof first-year spells then as now.",
      "C. Additional test that distinguishes 1 and 2 using\nscientific knowledge of blood, will explain later. Result: There's only one place\nin the recipe that makes you a wizard, and either you have two\npapers saying 'magic' or you don't.",
      "D. Are magical creatures losing their powers? Distinguishes\n1 from (2 or 3). Result: Magical creatures seem\nto be as strong as they ever were.",
      "\"A failed,\" said Harry Potter. \"B is weak evidence for 1 over 2.\nC falsifies 2. D falsifies 1. 4 was unlikely and B argues against 4\nas well. 5 was unlikely and D argues against it. 6 is falsified\nalong with 2. That leaves 3. Interdict of Merlin or not, I didn't\nactually find any known spell that couldn't be cast. So when you\nadd it all up, it looks like knowledge is being lost.\"",
      "And the trap snapped shut.",
      "As soon as the panic went away, as soon as Draco understood that\nmagic wasn't fading out, it took all of five seconds to\nrealize.",
      "Draco shoved himself away from the desk and stood up so hard\nthat his chair skittered with a scraping noise across the floor and\nfell over.",
      "\"So it was all just a stupid trick, then.\"",
      "Harry Potter stared at him for a moment, still sitting. When he\nspoke, his voice was quiet. \"It was a fair test, Draco. If it had\ncome out a different way, I would have accepted it. That's not\nsomething I would ever cheat on. Ever. I didn't look at your data\nbefore I made my predictions. I told you up front when the\nInterdict of Merlin invalidated the first experiment -\"",
      "\"Oh,\" Draco said, the anger starting to come out into his voice,\n\"you didn't know how the whole thing was going to come out?\"",
      "\"I didn't know anything you didn't know,\" Harry said,\nstill quietly. \"I admit that I suspected. Hermione Granger was too\npowerful, she should have been barely magical and she wasn't, how\ncan a Muggleborn be the best spellcaster in Hogwarts? And she's\ngetting the best grades on her essays too, it's too much\ncoincidence for one girl to be the strongest magically and\nacademically unless there's a single cause. Hermione Granger's\nexistence pointed to there being only one thing that makes you a\nwizard, something you either have or you don't, and the power\ndifferences coming from how much we know and how much we practice.\nAnd there weren't different classes for purebloods and Muggleborns,\nand so on. There were too many ways the world didn't look the way\nit would look if you were right. But Draco, I didn't see anything\nyou couldn't see too. I didn't perform any tests I didn't tell you\nabout. I didn't cheat, Draco. I wanted us to work out the answer\ntogether. And I never thought that magic might be fading out of the\nworld until you said it. It was a scary idea for me, too.\"",
      "\"Whatever,\" Draco said. He was working very hard to control his\nvoice and not just start screaming at Harry. \"You claim you're not\ngoing to run off and tell anyone else about this.\"",
      "\"Not without consulting you first,\" Harry said. He opened his\nhands in a pleading gesture. \"Draco, I'm being as nice as I can but\nthe world turned out to just not be that way.\"",
      "\"Fine. Then you and I are through. I'm going to just walk away\nand forget any of this ever happened.\"",
      "Draco spun around, feeling the burning sensation in his throat,\nthe sense of betrayal, and that was when he realized he really\nhad liked Harry Potter, and that thought didn't slow him\ndown for a moment as he strode toward the classroom door.",
      "And Harry Potter's voice came, now louder, and worried:",
      "\"Draco... you can't forget. Don't you understand? That\nwas your sacrifice.\"",
      "Draco stopped in midstride and turned around. \"What are\nyou talking about?\"",
      "But there was already a freezing coldness in Draco's spine.",
      "He knew even before Harry Potter said it.",
      "\"To become a scientist. You questioned one of your beliefs, not\njust a small belief but something that had great significance to\nyou. You did experiments, gathered data, and the outcome proved the\nbelief was wrong. You saw the results and understood what they\nmeant.\" Harry Potter's voice was faltering. \"Remember, Draco, you\ncan't sacrifice a true belief that way, because the\nexperiments will confirm it instead of falsifying it. Your\nsacrifice to become a scientist was your false belief that\nwizard blood was mixing and getting weaker.\"",
      "\"That's not true!\u202f\" said Draco. \"I didn't sacrifice the\nbelief. I still believe that!\" His voice was getting louder, and\nthe chill was getting worse.",
      "Harry Potter shook his head. His voice came in a whisper.\n\"Draco... I'm sorry, Draco, you don't believe it, not\nanymore.\" Harry's voice rose again. \"I'll prove it to you. Imagine\nthat someone tells you they're keeping a dragon in their house. You\ntell them you want to see it. They say it's an invisible dragon.\nYou say fine, you'll listen to it move. They say it's an inaudible\ndragon. You say you'll throw some cooking flour into the air and\nsee the outline of the dragon. They say the dragon is permeable to\nflour. And the telling thing is that they know, in\nadvance, exactly which experimental results they'll have\nto explain away. They know everything will come out the\nway it does if there's no dragon, they know in advance\njust which excuses they'll have to make. So maybe they say\nthere's a dragon. Maybe they believe they believe there's\na dragon, it's called belief-in-belief. But they don't actually\nbelieve it. You can be mistaken about what you believe, most people\nnever realize there's a difference between believing something and\nthinking it's good to believe it.\" Harry Potter had risen from the\ndesk now, and taken a few steps toward Draco. \"And Draco, you don't\nbelieve any more in blood purism, I'll show you that you don't. If\nblood purism is true, then Hermione Granger doesn't make sense, so\nwhat could explain her? Maybe she's a wizarding orphan raised by\nMuggles, just like I was? I could go to Granger and ask to see\npictures of her parents, to see if she looks like them. Would you\nexpect her to look different? Should we go perform that test?\"",
      "\"They would have put her with relatives,\" Draco said, his voice\ntrembling. \"They'll still look the same.\"",
      "\"You see. You already know what experimental result you'll have\nto excuse. If you still believed in blood purism you would say,\nsure, let's go take a look, I bet she won't look like her parents,\nshe's too powerful to be a real Muggleborn -\"",
      "\"They would have put her with relatives!\"",
      "\"Scientists can do tests to check for sure if someone is the\ntrue child of a father. Granger would probably do it if I paid her\nfamily enough. She wouldn't be afraid of the results. So\nwhat do you expect that test to show? Tell me to run it and we\nwill. But you already know what the test will say. You'll always\nknow. You won't ever be able to forget. You might wish you\nbelieved in blood purism, but you'll always expect to see\nhappen just exactly what would happen if there was only one\nthing that made you a wizard. That was your sacrifice to become a\nscientist.\"",
      "Draco's breathing was ragged. \"Do you realize what you've\ndone?\u202f\" Draco surged forward and he seized Harry by the collar\nof his robes. His voice rose to a scream, it sounded unbearably\nloud in the closed classroom and the silence. \"Do you realize\nwhat you've done?\u202f\"",
      "Harry's voice was shaky. \"You had a belief. The belief was\nfalse. I helped you see that. What's true is already so, owning up\nto it doesn't make it worse -\"",
      "The fingers on Draco's right hand clenched into a fist and that\nhand dropped down and blasted up unstoppably and punched Harry\nPotter in the jaw so hard that his body went crashing back into a\ndesk and then to the floor.",
      "\"Idiot!\u202f\" screamed Draco. \"Idiot! Idiot!\u202f\"",
      "\"Draco,\" whispered Harry from the floor, \"Draco, I'm sorry, I\ndidn't think this would happen for months, I didn't expect you to\nawaken as a scientist this quickly, I thought I would have longer\nto prepare you, teach you the techniques that make it hurt less to\nadmit you're wrong -\"",
      "\"What about Father?\" Draco said. His voice trembled with rage.\n\"Were you going to prepare him or did you just not\ncare what happened after this?\"",
      "\"You can't tell him!\u202f\" Harry said, his voice rising in\nalarm. \"He's not a scientist! You promised, Draco!\"",
      "For a moment the thought of Father not knowing came as a\nrelief.",
      "And then the real anger started to rise.",
      "\"So you planned for me to lie to him and tell him I still\nbelieve,\" Draco said, voice shaking. \"I'll always have to lie to\nhim, and now when I grow up I can't be a Death Eater, and I won't\neven be able to tell him why not.\"",
      "\"If your father really loves you,\" whispered Harry from the\nfloor, \"he'll still love you even if you don't become a Death\nEater, and it sounds like your father does really love\nyou, Draco -\"",
      "\"Your stepfather is a scientist,\" Draco said. The words\ncoming out like biting knives. \"If you weren't going to be\na scientist, he would still love you. But you'd be a little\nless special to him.\"",
      "Harry flinched. The boy opened his mouth, as if to say 'I'm\nsorry', and then closed his mouth, seeming to think better of it,\nwhich was either very smart of him or very lucky, because Draco\nmight have tried to kill him.",
      "\"You should have warned me,\" Draco said. His voice rose.\n\"You should have warned me!\u202f\"",
      "\"I... I did... every time I told you about the power, I told you\nabout the price. I said, you have to admit you're wrong. I said\nthis would be the hardest path for you. That this was the sacrifice\nanyone had to make to become a scientist. I said, what if the\nexperiment says one thing and your family and friends say another\n-\"",
      "\"You call that a warning?\u202f\" Draco was screaming now.\n\"You call that a warning? When we're doing a ritual that calls\nfor a permanent sacrifice?\u202f\"",
      "\"I... I...\" The boy on the floor swallowed. \"I guess maybe it\nwasn't clear. I'm sorry. But that which can be destroyed by the\ntruth should be.\"",
      "Hitting him wasn't enough.",
      "\"You're wrong about one thing,\" Draco said, his voice deadly.\n\"Granger isn't the strongest student in Hogwarts. She just gets the\nbest grades in class. You're about to find out the difference.\"",
      "Sudden shock showed in Harry's face, and he tried to roll\nquickly to his feet -",
      "It was already too late for him.",
      "\"Expelliarmus!\u202f\"",
      "Harry's wand flew across the room.",
      "\"Gom jabbar!\u202f\"",
      "A pulse of inky blackness struck Harry's left hand.",
      "\"That's a torture spell,\" said Draco. \"It's for getting\ninformation out of people. I'm just going to leave it on you and\nlock the door behind me when I go. Maybe I'll set the locking spell\nto wear off after a few hours. Maybe it won't wear off until you\ndie in here. Have fun.\"",
      "Draco moved smoothly backward, wand still on Harry. Draco's hand\ndipped down, picked up his bookbag, without his aim wavering.",
      "The pain was already showing in Harry Potter's face as he spoke.\n\"Malfoys are above the underage magic laws, I take it? It's not\nbecause your blood is stronger. It's because you already practiced.\nIn the beginning you were as weak as any of us. Is my prediction\nwrong?\"",
      "Draco's hand whitened on his wand, but his aim stayed\nsteady.",
      "\"Just so you know,\" Harry said through gritted teeth, \"if you'd\ntold me I was wrong I would have listened. I won't ever\ntorture you when you show me that I'm wrong. And you\nwill. Someday. You're awakened as a scientist now, and\neven if you never learn to use your power, you'll always,\" Harry\ngasped, \"be looking, for ways, to test, your beliefs -\"",
      "Draco's backing away was less smooth, now, a little faster, and\nhe had to work to keep his wand on Harry as he reached back to open\nthe door and stepped back out of the classroom.",
      "Then Draco shut the door again.",
      "He cast the most powerful locking Charm he knew.",
      "Draco waited until he heard Harry's first scream before casting\nthe Quietus.",
      "And then he walked away.",
      "\"Aaahhhhh! Finite Incantatem! Aaaahhh!\u202f\"",
      "Harry's left hand had been put into a pot of boiling cooking oil\nand left there. He'd put everything he had into the Finite\nIncantatem and it still wasn't working.",
      "Some hexes required specific counters or you couldn't undo them,\nor maybe it was just that Draco was that much stronger.",
      "\"Aaaaahhhh!\u202f\"",
      "Harry's hand was really starting to hurt, now, and that was\ninterfering with his attempts to think creatively.",
      "But a few screams later, Harry realized what he had to do.",
      "His pouch, unfortunately, was on the wrong side of his body, and\nit took some twisting to reach into it, especially with his other\narm flailing around in a reflex, unstoppable attempt to fling off\nthe source of pain. By the time he managed it his other arm had\nmanaged to throw away his wand again.",
      "\"Medical ahhhhh kit! Medical kit!\"",
      "On the floor, the green light was too dim to see by.",
      "Harry couldn't stand. He couldn't crawl. He rolled across the\nfloor to where he thought his wand was, and it wasn't there, and\nwith one hand he managed to raise himself high enough to see his\nwand, and he rolled there, and got the wand, and rolled back to\nwhere the medical kit was opened. There was also a good deal of\nscreaming, and a bit of throwing up.",
      "It took eight tries before Harry could cast Lumos.",
      "And then, well, the package wasn't designed to be opened\none-handed, because all wizards were idiots, that was why. Harry\nhad to use his teeth and so it took a while before Harry finally\nmanaged to wrap the Numbcloth over his left hand.",
      "When all feeling in his left hand was finally gone, Harry let\nhis mind come apart, and lay motionless on the floor, and cried for\na while.",
      "Well, Harry's mind said silently into itself, when it\nhad recovered enough to think in words again. Was it worth\nit?",
      "Slowly, Harry's functional hand reached up to a desk.",
      "Harry pulled himself to his feet.",
      "Took a deep breath.",
      "Exhaled.",
      "Smiled.",
      "It wasn't much of a smile, but it was a smile nonetheless.",
      "Thank you, Professor Quirrell, I couldn't have lost without\nyou.",
      "He hadn't redeemed Draco yet, not even close. Contrary to what\nDraco himself might now believe, Draco was still the child of a\nDeath Eater, through and through. Still a boy who'd grown up\nthinking \"rape\" was something the cool older kids did. But it was\none heck of a start.",
      "Harry couldn't claim it had all gone just as planned. It had all\ngone just as completely made up on the spot. The plan\nhadn't called for this to happen until December or thereabouts,\nafter Harry had taught Draco the techniques not to deny the\nevidence when he saw it.",
      "But he'd seen the look of fear on Draco's face, realized that\nDraco was already taking an alternative hypothesis\nseriously, and seized the moment. One case of true curiosity had\nthe same sort of redeeming power in rationality that one case of\ntrue love had in movies.",
      "In retrospect, Harry had given himself hours to make the most\nimportant discovery in the history of magic, and months to break\nthrough the undeveloped mental barriers of an eleven-year-old boy.\nThis could indicate that Harry had some sort of major cognitive\ndeficit with respect to estimating task completion times.",
      "Was Harry going to Science Hell for what he'd done? Harry wasn't\nsure. He'd contrived to keep Draco's mind on the possibility that\nmagic was fading, made sure Draco would carry out the part of the\nexperiment that would seem at first to point in that direction.\nHe'd waited until after explaining genetics to prompt Draco into\nrealizing about magical creatures (though Harry had thought in\nterms of ancient artifacts like the Sorting Hat, which no one could\nduplicate anymore, but which continued to function). But Harry\nhadn't actually exaggerated any evidence, hadn't distorted the\nmeaning of any results. When the Interdict of Merlin had\ninvalidated the test that should have been definitive, he'd told\nDraco up front.",
      "And then there was the part after that...",
      "But he hadn't actually lied to Draco. Draco had\nbelieved it, and that would make it true.",
      "The end, admittedly, had not been fun.",
      "Harry turned, and staggered toward the door.",
      "Time to test Draco's locking spell.",
      "The first step was simply trying to turn the doorknob. Draco\ncould have been bluffing.",
      "Draco hadn't been bluffing.",
      "\"Finite Incantatem.\" Harry's voice came out rather\nhoarse, and he could feel that the spell hadn't taken.",
      "So Harry tried it again, and that time it felt true. But another\ntwist at the doorknob showed it hadn't worked. No surprise\nthere.",
      "Time to bring out the big guns. Harry drew a deep breath. This\nspell was one of the most powerful he'd learned so far.",
      "\"Alohomora!\u202f\"",
      "Harry staggered a little after saying it.",
      "And the classroom door still didn't open.",
      "That shocked Harry. Harry hadn't been planning to go anywhere\nnear Dumbledore's forbidden corridor, of course. But a spell to\nopen magical locks had seemed like a useful sort of spell anyway,\nand so Harry had learned it. Was Dumbledore's forbidden corridor\nmeant to lure people so stupid that they didn't notice the security\nwas worse than what Draco Malfoy could put on it?",
      "Fear was creeping back into Harry's system. The placard in the\nmedical kit had said the Numbcloth could only safely be used for up\nto thirty minutes. After that it would come off automatically, and\nnot be reusable for 24 hours. Right now it was 6:51pm. He'd put on\nthe Numbcloth about five minutes ago.",
      "So Harry took a step back, and considered the door. It was a\nsolid panel of dark oaken wood, interrupted only by the brass metal\ndoorknob.",
      "Harry didn't know any explosive or cutting or smashing spells,\nand Transfiguring explosive would have violated the rule against\nTransfiguring things to be burned. Acid was a liquid and would have\nmade fumes...",
      "But that was no obstacle to a creative thinker.",
      "Harry laid his wand against one of the door's brass hinges, and\nconcentrated on the form of cotton as a pure abstraction apart from\nany material cotton, and also on the pure material apart from the\npattern that made it a brass hinge, and brought the two concepts\ntogether, imposing shape on substance. An hour of Transfiguration\npractice every day for a month had gotten Harry to the point where\nhe could Transfigure a subject of five cubic centimeters in just\nunder a minute.",
      "After two minutes the hinge hadn't changed at all.",
      "Whoever had designed Draco's locking spell, they'd thought of\nthat, too. Or the door was part of Hogwarts and the castle was\nimmune.",
      "A glance showed the walls to be solid stone. So was the floor.\nSo was the ceiling. You couldn't separately Transfigure a part of\nsomething that was a solid whole; Harry would have needed to try\nTransfiguring the whole wall, which would have taken hours or maybe\ndays of continuous effort, if he could have done it at all, and if\nthe wall wasn't contiguous with the rest of the whole castle...",
      "Harry's Time-Turner wouldn't open until 9pm. After that he could\ngo back to 6pm, before the door was locked.",
      "How long would the torture spell last?",
      "Harry swallowed hard. Tears were coming into his eyes again.",
      "His brilliantly creative mind had just offered the ingenious\nsuggestion that Harry could cut his hand off using the hacksaw in\nthe toolset stored in his pouch, which would hurt, obviously, but\nmight hurt a lot less than Draco's pain spell, since the nerves\nwould be gone; and he had tourniquets in the healer's kit.",
      "And that was obviously a hideously stupid idea that Harry would\nregret the rest of his entire life.",
      "But Harry didn't know if he could hold out for two hours under\ntorture.",
      "He wanted out of this classroom, he wanted out of this\nclassroom now, he didn't want to wait in here screaming\nfor two hours until he could use the Time-Turner, he needed to\nget out and find someone to get the torture spell off his\nhand...",
      "Think! Harry screamed at his brain. Think!\nThink!",
      "The Slytherin dorm was mostly empty. People were at dinner. For\nsome reason Draco himself wasn't feeling very hungry.",
      "Draco closed the door to his private room, locked it, Charmed it\nshut, Quieted it, sat down on his bed, and started to cry.",
      "It wasn't fair.",
      "It wasn't fair.",
      "It was the first time Draco had ever really lost\nbefore, Father had warned him that losing for real would hurt the\nfirst time it happened, but he'd lost so much, it wasn't\nfair, it wasn't fair for him to lose everything the very\nfirst time he lost.",
      "Somewhere in the dungeons, a boy Draco had actually liked was\nscreaming in pain. Draco had never hurt anyone he'd liked before.\nPunishing people who deserved it was supposed to be fun, but this\njust felt sick inside. Father hadn't warned him about that, and\nDraco wondered if it was a hard lesson everyone had to learn when\nthey grew up, or if Draco was just weak.",
      "Draco wished it were Pansy screaming. That would have felt\nbetter.",
      "And the worst part was knowing that it might have been a mistake\nto hurt Harry Potter.",
      "Who else was there for Draco now? Dumbledore? After what he'd\ndone? Draco would sooner have been burned alive.",
      "Draco would have to go back to Harry Potter because there was\nnowhere else for him to go. And if Harry Potter said he didn't want\nhim, then Draco would be nothing, just a pathetic little boy who\ncould never be a Death Eater, never join Dumbledore's faction,\nnever learn science.",
      "The trap had been perfectly set, perfectly executed. Father had\nwarned Draco over and over that what you sacrificed to Dark rituals\ncouldn't be regained. But Father hadn't known that the accursed\nMuggles had invented rituals that didn't need wands, rituals you\ncould be tricked into doing without knowing it, and that was only\none of the terrible secrets which scientists knew and which Harry\nPotter had brought with him.",
      "Draco started crying harder, then.",
      "He didn't want this, he didn't want this but there was\nno turning back. It was too late. He was already a scientist.",
      "Draco knew he should go back and free Harry Potter and\napologize. It would have been the smart thing to do.",
      "Instead Draco stayed in his bed and sobbed.",
      "He'd already hurt Harry Potter. It might be the only time Draco\never got to hurt him, and he would have to hold to that one memory\nfor the rest of his life.",
      "Let him keep screaming.",
      "Harry dropped the remnants of his hacksaw to the ground. The\nbrass hinges had proved impervious, not even scratched, and Harry\nwas beginning to suspect that even the desperation act of trying to\nTransfigure acid or explosives would have failed to open this door.\nOn the plus side, the attempt had destroyed the hacksaw.",
      "His watch said it was 7:02pm, with less than fifteen minutes\nleft, and Harry tried to remember if there were any other sharp\nthings in his pouch that needed destroying, and felt another fit of\ntears welling up. If only, when his Time-Turner opened, he could go\nback and prevent -",
      "And that was when Harry realized he was being\nsilly.",
      "It wasn't the first time he'd been locked in a room.",
      "Professor McGonagall had already told him the correct way to do\nthis.",
      "...she'd also told him not to use the Time-Turner for this sort\nof thing.",
      "Would Professor McGonagall realize that this occasion really\ndid warrant a special exception? Or just take away the\nTime-Turner entirely?",
      "Harry gathered up all his things, all the evidence, into his\npouch. A Scourgify took care of the vomit on the floor,\nthough not the sweat that had soaked his robes. He left the\noverturned desks overturned, it wasn't important enough to be worth\ndoing with one hand.",
      "When he was done, Harry glanced down at his watch. 7:04pm.",
      "And then Harry waited. Seconds passed, feeling like years.",
      "At 7:07pm, the door opened.",
      "Professor Flitwick's puff-bearded face looked rather concerned.\n\"Are you all right, Harry?\" said the squeaky voice of Ravenclaw's\nHead of House. \"I got a note saying you'd been locked in here\n-\""

      "He'd just taken for granted that no one would go to the\nauthorities when a Malfoy did something to them. That no one would\nwant Lucius Malfoy's eye on them, ever.",
      "But Harry Potter wasn't a frightened little Hufflepuff trying to\nstay out of the game. He was already playing it, and Father's eye\nwas already on him.",
      "\"What else did Madam Pomfrey say?\" said Draco, his heart in his\nthroat.",
      "\"Professor Flitwick said that the spell cast on my hand had been\na Dark torture hex and extremely serious business, and that\nrefusing to say who did it was absolutely unacceptable.\"",
      "There was a long pause.",
      "\"And then?\" Draco said in a shaking voice.",
      "Harry Potter smiled slightly. \"I apologized deeply, which made\nProfessor Flitwick look very stern, and then I told\nProfessor Flitwick that the whole thing was, indeed, extremely\nserious, secret, delicate business, and that I'd already\ninformed the Headmaster about the project.\"",
      "Draco gasped. \"No! Flitwick isn't going to just accept that!\nHe'll check with Dumbledore!\"",
      "\"Indeed,\" said Harry Potter. \"I was promptly hauled off to the\nHeadmaster's office.\"",
      "Draco was trembling now. If Dumbledore brought Harry Potter\nbefore the Wizengamot, willingly or otherwise, and had the\nBoy-Who-Lived testify under Veritaserum that Draco had tortured\nhim... too many people loved Harry Potter, Father could\nlose that vote...",
      "Father might be able to convince Dumbledore not to do that, but\nit would cost. Cost terribly. The game had rules now, you\ncouldn't just threaten someone at random any more. But Draco had\nwalked into Dumbledore's hands of his own free will. And Draco was\na very valuable hostage.",
      "Though since Draco couldn't be a Death Eater now, he wasn't as\nvaluable as Father thought.",
      "The thought tore at his heart like a Cutting Charm.",
      "\"Then what?\" whispered Draco.",
      "\"Dumbledore deduced immediately that it was you. He knew we'd\nbeen associating.\"",
      "The worst possible scenario. If Dumbledore hadn't guessed who\ndid it, he might not have risked using Legilimency just to find\nout... but if Dumbledore knew...",
      "\"And?\" Draco forced out the word.",
      "\"We had a little chat.\"",
      "\"And?\"",
      "Harry Potter grinned. \"And I explained that it would be in his\nbest interest not to do anything.\"",
      "Draco's mind ran into a brick wall and splattered. He just\nstared at Harry Potter with his mouth hanging slack like a\nfool.",
      "It took that long for Draco to remember.",
      "Harry knew Dumbledore's mysterious secret, the one Snape used as\nhis hold.",
      "Draco could just see it now. Dumbledore looking all stern,\nconcealing his eagerness as he explained to Harry what a terribly\nserious matter this was.",
      "And Harry politely telling Dumbledore to keep his mouth shut if\nhe knew what was good for him.",
      "Father had warned Draco against people like this, people who\ncould ruin you and still be so likable that it was hard to hate\nthem properly.",
      "\"After which,\" Harry said, \"the Headmaster told Professor\nFlitwick that this was, indeed, a secret and delicate matter of\nwhich he had already been informed, and that he did not think\npressing it at this time would help me or anyone. Professor\nFlitwick started to say something about the Headmaster's usual\nplotting going much too far, and I had to interrupt at that point\nand explain that it had been my own idea and not anything\nthe Headmaster forced me into, so Professor Flitwick spun around\nand started lecturing me, and the Headmaster interrupted\nhim and said that as the Boy-Who-Lived I was doomed to\nhave weird and dangerous adventures so I was safer if I got into\nthem on purpose instead of waiting for them to happen by accident,\nand that was when Professor Flitwick threw up his little hands and\nstarted shrieking in a high-pitched voice at both of us\nabout how he didn't care what we were cooking up together, but this\nwasn't ever to happen again for as long as I was in Ravenclaw House\nor he would have me thrown out and I could go to Gryffindor which\nwas where all this Dumbledoring belonged -\"",
      "Harry was making it very hard for Draco to hate\nhim.",
      "\"Anyway,\" Harry said, \"I didn't want to be thrown out of\nRavenclaw, so I promised Professor Flitwick that nothing like this\nwould happen again, and if it did, I would just tell him who did\nit.\"",
      "Harry's eyes should have been cold. They weren't. The voice\nshould have made it a deadly threat. It wasn't.",
      "And Draco saw the question that should have been obvious, and it\nkilled the mood in an instant.",
      "\"Why... didn't you?\"",
      "Harry walked over to the window, into the small beam of sunlight\nshining into the alcove, and turned his head outward, toward the\ngreen grounds of Hogwarts. The brightness shone on him, on his\nrobes, on his face.",
      "\"Why didn't I?\" Harry said. His voice caught. \"I guess because I\njust couldn't get angry at you. I knew I'd hurt you first. I won't\neven call it fair, because what I did to you was worse than what\nyou did to me.\"",
      "It was like running into another brick wall. Harry could have\nbeen speaking archaic Greek for all Draco understood him then.",
      "Draco's mind scrabbled for patterns and came up flat blank. The\nstatement was a concession that hadn't been in Harry's best\ninterests. It wasn't even what Harry should say to make Draco a\nmore loyal servant, now that Harry held power over him. For that\nHarry should be emphasizing how kindly he'd been, not how much he'd\nhurt Draco.",
      "\"Even so,\" Harry said, and now his voice was lower, almost a\nwhisper, \"please don't do that again, Draco. It hurt, and I'm not\nsure I could forgive you a second time. I'm not sure I'd be able to\nwant to.\"",
      "Draco just didn't get it.",
      "Was Harry trying to be friends with him?",
      "There was no way Harry Potter could be dumb enough to believe\nthat was still possible after what he'd done.",
      "You could be someone's friend and ally, like Draco had tried to\ndo with Harry, or you could destroy their life and leave them no\nother options. Not both.",
      "But then Draco didn't understand what else Harry could\nbe trying.",
      "And a strange thought came to Draco then, something Harry had\nkept talking about yesterday.",
      "And the thought was: Test it.",
      "You're awakened as a scientist now, Harry had said,\nand even if you never learn to use your power, you'll always,\nbe looking, for ways, to test, your beliefs... Those ominous\nwords, spoken in gasps of agony, had kept running through Draco's\nmind.",
      "If Harry was pretending to be the repentant friend who\nhad accidentally hurt someone...",
      "\"You planned what you did to me!\" Draco said, managing\nto put a note of accusation in his voice. \"You didn't do it because\nyou got angry, you did it because you wanted to!\"",
      "Fool, Harry Potter would say, of course I planned\nit, and now you're mine -",
      "Harry turned back toward Draco. \"What happened yesterday\nwasn't the plan,\" Harry said, his voice seeming stuck in\nhis throat. \"The plan was that I would teach you why you\nwere always better off knowing the truth, and then we would try\ntogether to discover the truth about blood, and whatever the answer\nwas we would accept it. Yesterday I... rushed things.\"",
      "\"Always better off knowing the truth,\" Draco said coldly. \"Like\nyou did me a favor.\"",
      "Harry nodded, blowing Draco's mind completely, and said, \"What\nif Lucius comes up with the same idea I did, that the problem is\nstronger wizards having fewer children? He might start a program to\npay the strongest purebloods to have more children. In fact, if\nblood purism were right, that's just what Lucius\nshould be doing - addressing the problem on his\nside, where he can make things happen right away. Right now, Draco,\nyou're the only friend Lucius has who would try to stop him from\nwasting the effort, because you're the only one who knows the\nreal truth and can predict the real results.\"",
      "The thought came to Draco that Harry Potter had been raised in a\nplace so strange that he was now effectively a magical creature\nrather than a wizard. Draco simply couldn't guess what Harry would\nsay or do next.",
      "\"Why?\u202f\" Draco said. Putting pain and betrayal into his\nvoice wasn't hard at all. \"Why did you do this to me? What\nwas your plan?\"",
      "\"Well,\" Harry said, \"you're Lucius's heir, and believe it or\nnot, Dumbledore thinks I belong to him. So we could grow up and\nfight their battles with each other. Or we could do something\nelse.\"",
      "Slowly, Draco's mind wrapped around this. \"You want to provoke a\nfight to the finish between them, then seize power after they're\nboth exhausted.\" Draco felt cold dread in his chest. He would\nhave to try and stop that no matter the cost to himself\n-",
      "But Harry shook his head. \"Stars above, no!\u202f\"",
      "\"No...?\"",
      "\"You wouldn't go along with that and neither would I,\" said\nHarry. \"This is our world, we don't want to break it. But\nimagine, say, Lucius thought the Conspiracy was your tool and you\nwere on his side, Dumbledore thought the Conspiracy was my tool and\nI was on his side, Lucius thought that you'd turned me and\nDumbledore believed the Conspiracy was mine, Dumbledore thought\nthat I'd turned you and Lucius believed the Conspiracy was yours,\nand so they both helped us out but only in ways that the other one\nwouldn't notice.\"",
      "Draco did not have to fake being speechless.",
      "Father had once taken him to see a play called The Tragedy\nof Light, about this incredibly clever Slytherin\nnamed Light who'd set out to purify the world of evil using an\nancient ring that could kill anyone whose name and face he knew,\nand who'd been opposed by another incredibly clever Slytherin, a\nvillain named Lawliet, who'd worn a disguise to conceal his true\nface; and Draco had shouted and cheered at all the right parts,\nespecially in the middle; and then the play had ended sadly and\nDraco had been hugely disappointed and Father had gently pointed\nout that the word 'Tragedy' was right there in the title.",
      "Afterward, Father had asked Draco if he understood why they had\ngone to see this play.",
      "Draco had said it was to teach him to be as cunning as Light and\nLawliet when he grew up.",
      "Father had said that Draco couldn't possibly be more wrong, and\npointed out that while Lawliet had cleverly concealed his face\nthere had been no good reason for him to tell Light his\nname. Father had then gone on to demolish almost every\npart of the play, while Draco listened with his eyes growing wider\nand wider. And Father had finished by saying that plays like this\nwere always unrealistic, because if the playwright had\nknown what someone actually as smart as Light would\nactually do, the playwright would have tried to take over\nthe world himself instead of just writing plays about it.",
      "That was when Father had told Draco about the Rule of Three,\nwhich was that any plot which required more than three different\nthings to happen would never work in real life.",
      "Father had further explained that since only a fool\nwould attempt a plot that was as complicated as possible,\nthe real limit was two.",
      "Draco couldn't even find words to describe the sheer gargantuan\nunworkability of Harry's master plan.",
      "But it was just the sort of mistake you would make if\nyou didn't have any mentors and thought you were clever and had\nlearned about plotting by watching plays.",
      "\"So,\" said Harry, \"what do you think of the plan?\"",
      "\"It's clever...\" Draco said slowly. Shouting brilliant!\nand gasping in awe would have looked too suspicious. \"Harry, can I\nask a question?\"",
      "\"Sure,\" said Harry.",
      "\"Why did you buy Granger an expensive pouch?\"",
      "\"To show no hard feelings,\" said Harry at once. \"Though I expect\nshe'll also feel awkward if she refuses any small requests I make\nover the next couple of months.\"",
      "And that was when Draco realized that Harry actually\nwas trying to be his friend.",
      "Harry's move against Granger had been smart, maybe even\nbrilliant. Make your enemy not suspect you, and put them\ninto your debt in a friendly way so that you could maneuver them\ninto position just by asking them. Draco couldn't have\ngotten away with that, his target would have been too suspicious,\nbut the Boy-Who-Lived could. So the first step of Harry's\nplot was to give his enemy an expensive present, Draco wouldn't\nhave thought of that, but it could\nwork...",
      "If you were Harry's enemy, his plots might be hard to see\nthrough at first, they might even be stupid, but his reasoning\nwould make sense once you understood it, you would\ncomprehend that he was trying to hurt you.",
      "The way Harry was acting toward Draco right now did not\nmake sense.",
      "Because if you were Harry's friend, then he tried to be\nfriends with you in the alien, incomprehensible way he'd been\nraised by Muggles to do, even if it meant destroying your entire\nlife.",
      "The silence stretched.",
      "\"I know that I've abused our friendship terribly,\" Harry said\nfinally. \"But please realize, Draco, that in the end, I just wanted\nthe two of us to find the truth together. Is that something you can\nforgive?\"",
      "A fork with two paths, but with only one path easy to go back on\nlater if Draco changed his mind...",
      "\"I guess I understand what you were trying to do,\" Draco lied,\n\"so yes.\"",
      "Harry's eyes lit up. \"I'm glad to hear that, Draco,\" he said\nsoftly.",
      "The two students stood in that alcove, Harry still dipped in the\nlone sunbeam, Draco in shadow.",
      "And Draco realized with a note of horror and despair, that\nalthough it was a terrifying fate indeed to be Harry's friend,\nHarry now had so many different avenues for threatening Draco that\nbeing his enemy would be even worse.",
      "Probably.",
      "Maybe.",
      "Well, he could always switch to being enemies later...",
      "He was doomed.",
      "\"So,\" Draco said. \"Now what?\"",
      "\"We study again next Saturday?\"",
      "\"It better not go like the last one -\"",
      "\"Don't worry, it won't,\" said Harry. \"A few more Saturdays like\nthat and you'd be ahead of me.\"",
      "Harry laughed. Draco didn't.",
      "\"Oh, and before you go,\" Harry said, and grinned sheepishly. \"I\nknow this is a bad time, but I wanted to ask you for advice about\nsomething, actually.\"",
      "\"Okay,\" Draco said, still a bit distracted by that last\nstatement.",
      "Harry's eyes grew intent. \"Buying that pouch for Granger used up\nmost of the gold I managed to steal from my Gringotts vault -\"",
      "What.",
      "\"- and McGonagall has the vault key, or Dumbledore does now,\nmaybe. And I was just about to launch a plot that might take some\nmoney, so I was wondering if you know how I can get access -\"",
      "\"I'll loan you the money,\" said Draco's mouth in sheer\nexistential reflex.",
      "Harry looked taken aback, but in a pleased way. \"Draco, you\ndon't have to -\"",
      "\"How much?\"",
      "Harry named the amount and Draco couldn't quite keep the shock\nfrom showing on his face. That was almost all the spending money\nFather had given Draco to last out the whole year, Draco would be\nleft with just a few Galleons -",
      "Then Draco mentally kicked himself. All he had to do was write\nFather and explain that the money was gone because he had managed\nto loan it to Harry Potter, and Father would send him a\nspecial congratulatory note written in golden ink, a giant\nChocolate Frog that would take two weeks to eat, and ten times as\nmany Galleons just in case Harry Potter needed another loan.",
      "\"It's way too much, isn't it,\" said Harry. \"I'm sorry, I\nshouldn't have asked -\"",
      "\"Excuse me, I am a Malfoy, you know,\" said Draco. \"I\nwas just surprised you wanted that much.\"",
      "\"Don't worry,\" Harry Potter said cheerfully. \"It's nothing that\nthreatens your family's interests, just me being evil.\"",
      "Draco nodded. \"No problem, then. You want to go get it right\nnow?\"",
      "\"Sure,\" said Harry.",
      "As they left the alcove and started heading toward the dungeons,\nDraco couldn't help but ask, \"So can you tell me which\nplot this is for?\"",
      "\"Rita Skeeter.\"",
      "Draco thought some very bad words to himself, but it was far too\nlate to say no.",
      "By the time they'd reached the dungeons, Draco had started\npulling together his thoughts again.",
      "He was having trouble hating Harry Potter. Harry\nhad been trying to be friendly, he was just insane.",
      "And that wasn't going to stop Draco's revenge or even slow it\ndown.",
      "\"So,\" Draco said, after looking around to make certain no one\nwas nearby. Their voices would both be Blurred, of course, but it\nnever hurt to be extra sure. \"I've been thinking. When we bring new\nrecruits into the Conspiracy, they're going to have to\nthink we're equals. Otherwise it would only take\none of them to blow the plot to Father. You already worked\nthat out, right?\"",
      "\"Naturally,\" said Harry.",
      "\"Will we be equals?\" said Draco.",
      "\"I'm afraid not,\" Harry said. It was clear that he was trying to\nsound gentle, and also clear that he was trying to suppress a good\ndeal of condescension and not quite succeeding. \"I'm sorry, Draco,\nbut you don't even know what the word Bayesian in\nBayesian Conspiracy means right now. You're going to have\nto study for months before we take anyone else in, just so you can\nput up a good front.\"",
      "\"Because I don't know enough science,\" Draco said, carefully\nkeeping his voice neutral.",
      "Harry shook his head at that. \"The problem isn't that you're\nignorant of specific science things like deoxyribonucleic acid.\nThat wouldn't stop you from being my equal. The problem is\nthat you aren't trained in the methods of rationality, the\ndeeper secret knowledge behind how all those discoveries\ngot made in the first place. I'll try to teach you those,\nbut they're a lot harder to learn. Think of what we did yesterday,\nDraco. Yes, you did some of the work. But I was the only one in\ncontrol. You answered some of the questions. I asked all of them.\nYou helped push. I did the steering by myself. And without the\nmethods of rationality, Draco, you can't possibly steer the\nConspiracy where it needs to go.\"",
      "\"I see,\" said Draco, his voice sounding disappointed.",
      "Harry's voice tried to gentle itself even more. \"I'll try to\nrespect your expertise, Draco, about things like people stuff. But\nyou need to respect my expertise too, and there's just no\nway you could be my equal when it comes to steering the\nConspiracy. You've only been a scientist for one day, you\nknow one secret about deoxyribonucleic acid, and you\naren't trained in any of the methods of rationality.\"",
      "\"I understand,\" said Draco.",
      "And he did.",
      "People stuff, Harry had said. Seizing control of the\nConspiracy probably wouldn't even be difficult. And afterward, he\nwould kill Harry Potter just to be sure -",
      "The memory rose up in Draco of how sick inside it had felt last\nnight, knowing Harry was screaming.",
      "Draco thought some more bad words.",
      "Fine. He wouldn't kill Harry. Harry had been raised by\nMuggles, it wasn't his fault he was insane.",
      "Instead, Harry would live on, just so that Draco could tell him\nthat it had all been for Harry's own good, really, he ought to be\ngrateful -",
      "And with a sudden twitch of surprised pleasure, Draco realized\nthat it actually was for Harry's own good. If Harry tried\nto carry out his plan of playing Dumbledore and Father for fools,\nhe would die.",
      "That made it perfect.",
      "Draco would take all of Harry's dreams away from him, just as\nHarry had done to him.",
      "Draco would tell Harry that it had been for his own good, and it\nwould be absolutely true.",
      "Draco would wield the Conspiracy and the power of science to\npurify the wizarding world, and Father would be as proud of him as\nif he'd been a Death Eater.",
      "Harry Potter's evil plots would be foiled, and the forces of\nright would prevail.",
      "The perfect revenge.",
      "Unless...",
      "Just pretend to be pretending to be a scientist, Harry\nhad told him.",
      "Draco didn't have words to describe exactly what was wrong with\nHarry's mind -",
      "(since Draco had never heard the term depth of\nrecursion)",
      "- but he could guess what sort of plots it implied.",
      "...unless all that was exactly what Harry wanted Draco\nto do as part of some even larger plot which Draco would\nplay right into by trying to foil this one, Harry might\neven know that his plan was unworkable, it might have no\npurpose except luring Draco to thwart it -",
      "No. That way lay madness. There had to be a\nlimit. The Dark Lord himself hadn't been that twisty. That\nsort of thing didn't happen in real life, only in Father's silly\nbedtime stories about foolish gargoyles who always ended up\nfurthering the hero's plans every time they tried to stop him.",
      "And beside Draco, Harry walked along with a smile on his face,\nthinking about the evolutionary origins of human intelligence.",
      "In the beginning, before people had quite understood how\nevolution worked, they'd gone around thinking crazy ideas like\nhuman intelligence evolved so that we could invent better\ntools.",
      "The reason why this was crazy was that only one person in the\ntribe had to invent a tool, and then everyone else would use it,\nand it would spread to other tribes, and still be used by their\ndescendants a hundred years later. That was great from the\nperspective of scientific progress, but in evolutionary terms, it\nmeant that the person who invented something didn't have much of a\nfitness advantage, didn't have all that many more\nchildren than everyone else. Only relative fitness\nadvantages could increase the relative frequency of a gene in the\npopulation, and drive some lonely mutation to the point where it\nwas universal and everyone had it. And brilliant inventions just\nweren't common enough to provide the sort of consistent selection\npressure it took to promote a mutation. It was a natural guess, if\nyou looked at humans with their guns and tanks and nuclear weapons\nand compared them to chimpanzees, that the intelligence was there\nto make the technology. A natural guess, but wrong.",
      "Before people had quite understood how evolution worked, they'd\ngone around thinking crazy ideas like the climate changed, and\ntribes had to migrate, and people had to become smarter in order to\nsolve all the novel problems.",
      "But human beings had four times the brain size of a chimpanzee.\n20% of a human's metabolic energy went into feeding the brain.\nHumans were ridiculously smarter than any other species.\nThat sort of thing didn't happen because the environment stepped up\nthe difficulty of its problems a little. Then the organisms would\njust get a little smarter to solve them. Ending up with that\ngigantic outsized brain must have taken some sort of\nrunaway evolutionary process, something that would push\nand push without limits.",
      "And today's scientists had a pretty good guess at what that\nrunaway evolutionary process had been.",
      "Harry had once read a famous book called Chimpanzee\nPolitics. The book had described how an adult chimpanzee named\nLuit had confronted the aging alpha, Yeroen, with the help of a\nyoung, recently matured chimpanzee named Nikkie. Nikkie had not\nintervened directly in the fights between Luit and Yeroen, but had\nprevented Yeroen's other supporters in the tribe from coming to his\naid, distracting them whenever a confrontation developed between\nLuit and Yeroen. And in time Luit had won, and become the new\nalpha, with Nikkie as the second most powerful...",
      "...though it hadn't taken very long after that for Nikkie to\nform an alliance with the defeated Yeroen, overthrow Luit, and\nbecome the new new alpha.",
      "It really made you appreciate what millions of years of hominids\ntrying to outwit each other - an evolutionary arms race\nwithout limit - had led to in the way of increased mental\ncapacity.",
      "'Cause, y'know, a human would have totally seen that one\ncoming.",
      "And beside Harry, Draco walked along, suppressing his smile as\nhe thought about his revenge.",
      "Someday, maybe in years but someday, Harry Potter would learn\njust what it meant to underestimate a Malfoy.",
      "Draco had awakened as a scientist in a single day. Harry had\nsaid that wasn't supposed to happen for months.",
      "But of course if you were a Malfoy, you would be a more powerful\nscientist than anyone who wasn't.",
      "So Draco would learn all of Harry Potter's methods of\nrationality, and then when the time was ripe -"

      "To seek out new life, and J. K. Rowling!",
      "Note: Since the science in this story is usually all correct, I\ninclude a warning that in Ch. 22-25 Harry overlooks many\npossibilities, the most important of which is that there are lots\nof magical genes but they're all on one chromosome (which wouldn't\nhappen naturally, but the chromosome might have been engineered).\nIn this case, the inheritance pattern would be Mendelian, but the\nmagical chromosome could still be degraded by chromosomal crossover\nwith its nonmagical homologue. (Harry has read about Mendel and\nchromosomes in science history books, but he hasn't studied enough\nactual genetics to know about chromosomal crossover. Hey, he's only\neleven.) However, although a modern science journal would find a\nlot more nits to pick, everything Harry presents as strong\nevidence is in fact strong evidence - the other possibilities are\nimprobable.",
      "Act 2:",
      "(The sun shone brilliantly into the Great Hall from the\nenchanted sky-ceiling above, illuminating the students as though\nthey sat beneath the naked sky, gleaming from their plates and\nbowls, as, refreshed by a night's sleep, they inhaled breakfast in\npreparation for whatever plans they'd made for their Sunday.)",
      "So. There was only one thing that made you a wizard.",
      "That wasn't surprising, when you thought about it. What DNA\nmostly did was tell ribosomes how to chain amino acids together\ninto proteins. Conventional physics seemed quite capable of\ndescribing amino acids, and no matter how many amino acids you\nchained together, conventional physics said you would never, ever\nget magic out of it.",
      "And yet magic seemed to be hereditary, following DNA.",
      "Then that probably wasn't because the DNA was chaining\ntogether nonmagical amino acids into magical proteins.",
      "Rather the key DNA sequence did not, of itself, give you your\nmagic at all.",
      "Magic came from somewhere else.",
      "(At the Ravenclaw table there was one boy who was staring off\ninto space, as his right hand automatically spooned some\nunimportant food into his mouth from whatever was in front of him.\nYou probably could have substituted a pile of dirt and he wouldn't\nhave noticed.)",
      "And for some reason the Source of Magic was paying attention to\na particular DNA marker among individuals who were ordinary\nape-descended humans in every other way.",
      "(Actually there were quite a lot of boys and girls staring off\ninto space. It was the Ravenclaw table, after all.)",
      "There were other lines of logic leading to the same conclusion.\nComplex machinery was always universal within a sexually\nreproducing species. If gene B relied on gene A, then A had to be\nuseful on its own, and rise to near-universality in the gene pool\non its own, before B would be useful often enough to confer a\nfitness advantage. Then once B was universal you would get a\nvariant A* that relied on B, and then C that relied on A* and B,\nthen B* that relied on C, until the whole machine would fall apart\nif you removed a single piece. But it all had to happen\nincrementally - evolution never looked ahead, evolution\nwould never start promoting B in preparation for A\nbecoming universal later. Evolution was the simple historical fact\nthat, whichever organisms did in fact have the most children, their\ngenes would in fact be more frequent in the next generation. So\neach piece of a complex machine had to become nearly universal\nbefore other pieces in the machine would evolve to depend on its\npresence.",
      "So complex, interdependent machinery, the powerful\nsophisticated protein machines that drove life, was always\nuniversal within a sexually reproducing species - except\nfor a small handful of non-interdependent\nvariants that were being selected on at any given time, as\nfurther complexity was slowly laid down. It was why all human\nbeings had the same underlying brain design, the same emotions, the\nsame facial expressions wired up to those emotions; those\nadaptations were complex, so they had to be universal.",
      "If magic had been like that, a big complex adaptation with lots\nof necessary genes, then a wizard mating with a Muggle would have\nresulted in a child with only half those parts and half the machine\nwouldn't do much. And so there would have been no Muggleborns,\never. Even if all the pieces had individually gotten into the\nMuggle gene pool, they'd never reassemble all in one place to form\na wizard.",
      "There hadn't been some genetically isolated valley of humans\nthat had stumbled onto an evolutionary pathway leading to\nsophisticated magical sections of the brain. That complex genetic\nmachinery, if wizards interbred with Muggles, would never have\nreassembled into Muggleborns.",
      "So however your genes made you a wizard, it wasn't by\ncontaining the blueprints for complicated machinery.",
      "That was the other reason Harry had guessed the Mendelian\npattern would be there. If magical genes weren't complicated, why\nwould there be more than one?",
      "And yet magic itself seemed pretty complicated. A door-locking\nspell would prevent the door from opening and prevent you\nfrom Transfiguring the hinges and resist Finite\nIncantatem and Alohomora. Many elements all pointing\nin the same direction: you could call that goal-orientation, or in\nsimpler language, purposefulness.",
      "There were only two known causes of purposeful complexity.\nNatural selection, which produced things like butterflies. And\nintelligent engineering, which produced things like cars.",
      "Magic didn't seem like something that had self-replicated into\nexistence. Spells were purposefully complicated, but not, like a\nbutterfly, complicated for the purpose of making copies of\nthemselves. Spells were complicated for the purpose of serving\ntheir user, like a car.",
      "Some intelligent engineer, then, had created the Source of\nMagic, and told it to pay attention to a particular DNA marker.",
      "The obvious next thought was that this had something to do with\n\"Atlantis\".",
      "Harry had asked Hermione about that earlier - on the train to\nHogwarts, after hearing Draco say it - and so far as she knew,\nnothing more was known than the word itself.",
      "It might have been pure legend. But it was also plausible enough\nthat a civilization of magic-users, especially one from\nbefore the Interdict of Merlin, would have managed to blow\nitself up.",
      "The line of reasoning continued: Atlantis had been an isolated\ncivilization that had somehow brought into being the Source of\nMagic, and told it to serve only people with the Atlantean genetic\nmarker, the blood of Atlantis.",
      "And by similar logic: The words a wizard spoke, the wand\nmovements, those weren't complicated enough of themselves to build\nup the spell effects from scratch - not the way that the three\nbillion base pairs of human DNA actually were complicated\nenough to build a human body from scratch, not the way that\ncomputer programs took up thousands of bytes of data.",
      "So the words and wand movements were just triggers, levers\npulled on some hidden and more complex machine. Buttons, not\nblueprints.",
      "And just like a computer program wouldn't compile if you made a\nsingle spelling error, the Source of Magic wouldn't respond to you\nunless you cast your spells in exactly the right way.",
      "The chain of logic was inexorable.",
      "And it led inevitably toward a single final conclusion.",
      "The ancient forebears of the wizards, thousands of years\nearlier, had told the Source of Magic to only levitate things if\nyou said...",
      "'Wingardium Leviosa.'",
      "Harry slumped over at the breakfast table, resting his forehead\nwearily on his right hand.",
      "There was a story from the dawn days of Artificial Intelligence\n- back when they were just starting out and no one had yet realized\nthe problem would be difficult - about a professor who had\ndelegated one of his grad students to solve the problem of computer\nvision.",
      "Harry was beginning to understand how that grad student must\nhave felt.",
      "This could take a while.",
      "Why did it take more effort to cast the Alohomora spell, if it\nwas just like pressing a button?",
      "Who'd been silly enough to build in a spell for Avada\nKedavra that could only be cast using hatred?",
      "Why did wordless Transfiguration require you to make a complete\nmental separation between the concept of form and concept of\nmaterial?",
      "Harry might not be done with this problem by the time he\ngraduated Hogwarts. He could still be working on this problem when\nhe was thirty years old. Hermione had been right, Harry\nhadn't realized that on a gut level before. He'd just\ngiven an inspiring speech about determination.",
      "Harry's mind briefly considered whether to get on a gut level\nthat he might never solve the problem at all, then decided that\nwould be taking things much too far.",
      "Besides, so long as he could get as far as immortality in the\nfirst few decades, he'd be fine.",
      "What method had the Dark Lord used? Come to think, the fact that\nthe Dark Lord had somehow managed to survive the death of his first\nbody was almost infinitely more important than the fact\nthat he'd tried to take over magical Britain -",
      "\"Excuse me,\" said an expected voice from behind him in very\nunexpected tones. \"At your convenience, Mr. Malfoy requests the\nfavor of a conversation.\"",
      "Harry did not choke on his breakfast cereal. Instead he turned\naround and beheld Mr. Crabbe.",
      "\"Excuse me,\" said Harry. \"Don't you mean 'Da boss wants\nta talk wid youse?'\"",
      "Mr. Crabbe didn't look happy. \"Mr. Malfoy instructed me to speak\nproperly.\"",
      "\"I can't hear you,\" Harry said. \"You're not speaking properly.\"\nHe turned back to his bowl of tiny blue crystal snowflakes and\ndeliberately ate another spoonful.",
      "\"Da boss wants to talk with youse,\" came a threatening voice\nfrom behind him. \"Ya'd better come see him if ya know what's good\nfor ya.\"",
      "There. Now everything was going according to plan.",

      "\"A reason?\u202f\" said the old wizard. He restrained the\nfury from his face. The boy before him had been the victim, and\ncertainly did not need to be frightened any further. \"There is\nnothing that can excuse -\"",
      "\"What I did to him was worse.\"",
      "The old wizard stiffened in sudden horror. \"Harry, what have\nyou done?\u202f\"",
      "\"I tricked Draco into believing that I'd tricked him into\nparticipating in a ritual that sacrificed his belief in blood\npurism. And that meant he couldn't be a Death Eater when he grew\nup. He'd lost everything, Headmaster.\"",
      "There was a long quiet in the office, broken only by the tiny\npuffs and whistles of the fiddly things, which after enough time\nhad come to seem like silence.",
      "\"Dear me,\" said the old wizard, \"I do feel silly. And\nhere I was expecting you might try to redeem the heir of\nMalfoy by, say, showing him true friendship and\nkindness.\"",
      "\"Ha! Yeah, like that would have worked.\"",
      "The old wizard sighed. This was taking it too far. \"Tell me,\nHarry. Did it even occur to you that there was something\nincongruous about setting out to redeem someone through\nlies and trickery?\"",
      "\"I did it without telling any direct lies, and since we're\ntalking about Draco Malfoy here, I think the word you're looking\nfor is congruous.\" The boy looked rather smug.",

      "The reason for this was simple: It did stretch on for\nmiles.",
      "The time was three in the morning, and Fred and George were\nstarting the long way down the secret passage that led from a\nstatue of a one-eyed witch in Hogwarts, to the cellar of the\nHoneydukes candyshop in Hogsmeade.",
      "\"How's it doing?\" said Fred in a low voice.",
      "(Not that there'd be anyone listening, but there was something\nodd about talking in a normal voice when you were going through a\nsecret passage.)",

Chances were that no one except Dumbledore\ncould fix it if it was broken.",
      "And the Weasley twins weren't about to turn the Map over to\nDumbledore. It would have been an unforgivable insult to the\nMarauders - the four unknowns who'd managed to steal part of the\nHogwarts security system, something probably forged by\nSalazar Slytherin himself, and twist it into a tool for student\npranking.",
      "Some might have considered it disrespectful.",
      "Some might have considered it criminal.",
      "The Weasley twins firmly believed that if Godric Gryffindor had\nbeen around to see it, he would have approved.",
      "The brothers walked on and on and on, mostly in silence. The\nWeasley twins talked to each other when they were thinking through\nnew pranks, or when one of them knew something the other didn't.\nOtherwise there wasn't much point.

      "\"Not exactly, Mr. Flume,\" said Fred. \"We were hoping you could\nhelp us with something considerably more... interesting.\"",
      "\"Now, boys,\" said Flume, sounding severe, \"I hope you didn't\nwake me up just so I could tell you again that I'm not selling you\nany merchandise that could get you into real trouble. Not until\nyou're sixteen, anyways -\"",
      "George drew forth an item from his robes, and wordlessly passed\nit to Flume. \"Have you seen this?\" said Fred.",
      "Flume looked at yesterday's edition of the Daily\nProphet and nodded, scowling. The headline on the paper read\nTHE NEXT DARK LORD? and showed a young boy which some student's\ncamera had managed to catch in an uncharacteristically cold and\ngrim expression.",
      "\"I can't believe that Malfoy,\" Flume snapped. \"Going after the\nboy when he's only eleven! The man ought to be ground up and used\nto make chocolates!\"",
      "Fred and George blinked in unison. Malfoy was behind\nRita Skeeter? Harry Potter hadn't warned them about that... which\nsurely meant that Harry didn't know. He never would have brought\nthem in if he did...",

      "\"Miss Skeeter,\" said the man, sounding rather severe and cold\nfor someone whose face looked that young. \"Fancy running into you\nhere.\"",
      "\"Out of my way, buster!\" snapped Rita, and tried to step around\nhim.",
      "The man in her pathway matched the movement so perfectly that it\nwas like neither of them had moved at all, just stood still while\nthe street shifted around them.",
      "Rita's eyes narrowed. \"Who do you think you are?\"",
      "\"How very foolish,\" the man said dryly. \"It would have been wise\nto memorize the face of the disguised Death Eater training Harry\nPotter to be the next Dark Lord.

      "Rita took a moment to place the reference. This was\nQuirinus Quirrell?

And his hair\nwas already falling out? Couldn't he afford a healer?",
      "No, that wasn't important, she had a time and a place and a\nbeetle to be. She'd just received an anonymous tip about Madam\nBones making time with one of her younger assistants.

      "\"Out of my way!\u202f\" Rita said, and tried to push Quirrell\nfrom her path. Quirrell's arm brushed her own, deflecting, and Rita\nstaggered as the thrust went into the thin air.",
      "Quirrell pulled up the sleeve of his left robe, showing his left\narm. \"Observe,\" said Quirrell, \"no Dark Mark. I would like your\npaper to publish a retraction.\"",

      "Quirrell stared at her for a moment.",
      "Then he smiled.",
      "\"Miss Skeeter,\" said Quirrell, \"I had hoped to find some lever\nthat would prove persuasive. Yet I find that I cannot deny myself\nthe pleasure of simply crushing you.\"",

A speech to the effect that Fred and George\nand Lee had tremendous potential if they could just learn to be\nweirder. To make people's lives surreal, instead\nof just surprising them with the equivalents of buckets of water\npropped above doors. (Fred and George had exchanged interested\nlooks, they'd never thought of that one.) Harry Potter had invoked\na picture of the prank they'd pulled on Neville - which, Harry had\nmentioned with some remorse, the Sorting Hat had chewed him out on\n- but which must have made Neville doubt his own sanity.\nFor Neville it would have felt like being suddenly transported into\nan alternate universe. The same way everyone else had felt when\nthey'd seen Snape apologize. That was the true power of\npranking.",
      "Are you with me? Harry Potter had cried, and Lee Jordan\nhad answered no.",
      "\"Count us in,\" said Fred, or possibly George, for there\nwas no doubt that Godric Gryffindor would have said yes.",

      "The three members of the Order of Chaos got down to\nbusiness.",
      "(It wasn't that sad. Fred and George would still work\nwith Lee on giant spider pranks, same as ever. They'd only started\ncalling it the Order of Chaos in order to recruit Harry Potter,\nafter Ron had told them about Harry being weird and evil, and Fred\nand George had decided to save Harry by showing him true friendship\nand kindness. Thankfully this no longer seemed necessary - although\nthey weren't quite sure about that...)",
      "\"So,\" said one of the twins, \"what's this about?\"",

      "Fred and George looked at each other, a bit puzzled. \"You want\nus to slip her some of our more interesting candies?\"",
      "\"No,\" said Harry. \"No, no, no! That's giant-spider\nthinking! Come on, what would you do if you heard that\nRita Skeeter was looking for rumors about you?\u202f\"",
      "That made it obvious.",
      "Grins slowly started on the faces of Fred and George.",
      "\"Start rumors about ourselves,\" they replied.",
      "\"Exactly,\" said Harry, grinning widely. \"But these\ncan't be just any rumors. I want to teach people never to\nbelieve what the newspaper says about Harry Potter, any more than\nMuggles believe what the newspaper says about Elvis. At first I\njust thought about flooding Rita Skeeter with so many rumors that\nshe wouldn't know what to believe, but then she'll just cherry-pick\nthe ones that sound plausible and bad. So what I want you to do is\ncreate a fake story about me, and get Rita Skeeter to believe it\nsomehow. But it has to be something that, afterward, everyone will\nknow was fake. We want to fool Rita Skeeter and her\neditors, and afterward have the proof come out that it was\nfalse. And of course - given that those are the requirements - the\nstory has to be as ridiculous as it can possibly be, and\nstill get printed. Do you understand what I want you to do?\"",
      "\"Not exactly...\" Fred or George said slowly. \"You want us to\ninvent the story?\"",
      "\"I want you to do all of it,\" Harry Potter said. \"I'm\nsort of busy right now, plus I want to be able to say truthfully\nthat I had no idea what was coming. Surprise me.\"",
      "For a moment there was a very evil grin on the faces of Fred and\nGeorge.",
      "Then they turned serious. \"But Harry, we don't really know how\nto do anything like that -\"",
      "\"So figure it out,\" Harry said. \"I have confidence in you. Not\ntotal confidence, but if you can't do it,\ntell me that, and I'll try someone else, or do it myself.\nIf you have a really good idea - for both the ridiculous story, and\nhow to convince Rita Skeeter and her editors to print it - then you\ncan go ahead and do it. But don't go with something mediocre. If\nyou can't come up with something awesome, just say\nso.\"",
      "Fred and George exchanged worried glances.",
      "\"I can't think of anything,\" said George.",
      "\"Neither can I,\" said Fred. \"Sorry.\"",
      "Harry stared at them.",
      "And then Harry began to explain how you went about thinking of\nthings.",
      "It had been known to take longer than two seconds, said\nHarry.",
      "You never called any question impossible, said\nHarry, until you had taken an actual clock and thought about it for\nfive minutes, by the motion of the minute hand. Not five minutes\nmetaphorically, five minutes by a physical clock.",
      "And furthermore, Harry said, his voice emphatic and his\nright hand thumping hard on the floor, you did not start\nout immediately looking for solutions.",
      "Harry then launched into an explanation of a test done by\nsomeone named Norman Maier, who was something called an\norganizational psychologist, and who'd asked two different sets of\nproblem-solving groups to tackle a problem.",
      "The problem, Harry said, had involved three employees doing\nthree jobs. The junior employee wanted to just do the easiest job.\nThe senior employee wanted to rotate between jobs, to avoid\nboredom. An efficiency expert had recommended giving the junior\nperson the easiest job and the senior person the hardest job, which\nwould be 20% more productive.",
      "One set of problem-solving groups had been given the\ninstruction \"Do not propose solutions until the problem has been\ndiscussed as thoroughly as possible without suggesting any.\"",
      "The other set of problem-solving groups had been given no\ninstructions. And those people had done the natural thing, and\nreacted to the presence of a problem by proposing solutions. And\npeople had gotten attached to those solutions, and started fighting\nabout them, and arguing about the relative importance of freedom\nversus efficiency and so on.",
      "The first set of problem-solving groups, the ones given\ninstructions to discuss the problem first and\nthen solve it, had been far more likely to hit upon the\nsolution of letting the junior employee keep the easiest job and\nrotating the other two people between the other two jobs, for what\nthe expert's data said would be a 19% improvement.",
      "Starting out by looking for solutions was taking things\nentirely out of order. Like starting a meal with dessert,\nonly bad.",
      "(Harry also quoted someone named Robyn Dawes as saying that the\nharder a problem was, the more likely people were to try to solve\nit immediately.)",
      "So Harry was going to leave this problem to Fred and George, and\nthey would discuss all the aspects of it and brainstorm anything\nthey thought might be remotely relevant. And they shouldn't try to\ncome up with an actual solution until they'd finished doing that,\nunless of course they did happen to randomly think of\nsomething awesome, in which case they could write it down for\nafterward and then go back to thinking. And he didn't want to hear\nback from them about any so-called failures to think of\nanything for at least a week. Some people spent\ndecades trying to think of things.",
      "\"Any questions?\" said Harry.",
      "Fred and George stared at each other.",
      "\"I can't think of any.\"",
      "\"Neither can I.\"",
      "Harry coughed gently. \"You didn't ask about your budget.\"",
      "Budget? they thought.",
      "\"I could just tell you the amount,\" Harry said. \"But I think\nthis will be more inspiring.\"",
      "Harry's hands dipped into his robe, and brought forth -",
      "Fred and George almost fell over, even though they were sitting\ndown.",
      "\"Don't spend it for the sake of spending it,\" Harry said. On the\nstone floor in front of them gleamed an absolutely ridiculous\namount of money. \"Only spend it if awesomeness requires; and what\nawesomeness does require, don't hesitate to spend. If there's\nanything left over, just return it afterward, I trust you. Oh, and\nyou get ten percent of what's there, regardless of how much you end\nup spending -\"",
      "\"We can't!\u202f\" blurted one of the twins. \"We don't accept\nmoney for that sort of thing!\"",
      "(The twins never took money for doing anything illegal. Unknown\nto Ambrosius Flume, they were selling all of his merchandise at\nzero percent markup. Fred and George wanted to be able to testify -\nunder Veritaserum if necessary - that they had not been\nprofiteering criminals, just providing a public service.)",
      "Harry frowned at them. \"But I'm asking you to put in some real\nwork here. A grownup would get paid for doing something like this,\nand it would still count as a favor for a friend. You\ncan't just hire people for this sort of thing.\"",
      "Fred and George shook their heads.",
      "\"Fine,\" Harry said. \"I'll just get you expensive Christmas\npresents, and if you try returning them to me I'll burn them. Now\nyou don't even know how much I'm going to spend on you,\nexcept, obviously, that it's going to be more than if you'd just\ntaken the money. And I'm going to buy you those presents\nanyway, so think about that before you tell me\nyou can't think of anything awesome.\"",
      "Harry stood up, smiling, and turned to go while Fred and George\nwere still gaping in shock. He strode a few steps away, and then\nturned back.",
      "\"Oh, one last thing,\" Harry said. \"Leave Professor Quirrell out\nof whatever you do. He doesn't like publicity. I know it'd be\neasier to get people to believe weird things about the Defense\nProfessor than anyone else, and I'm sorry to have to get in your\nway like that, but please, leave Professor Quirrell out of it.\"",
      "And Harry turned again and took a few more steps -",
      "Looked back one last time, and said, softly, \"Thank you.\"",
      "And left.",
      "There was a long pause after he'd departed.",
      "\"So,\" said one.",
      "\"So,\" said the other.",
      "\"The Defense Professor doesn't like publicity, does he.\"",
      "\"Harry doesn't know us very well, does he.\"",
      "\"No, he doesn't.\"",
      "\"But we won't use his money for that, of course.\"",
      "\"Of course not, that wouldn't be right. We'll do the Defense\nProfessor separately.\"",
      "\"We'll get some Gryffindors to write Skeeter, and say...\"",
      "\"...his sleeve lifted up one time in Defense class, and they saw\nthe Dark Mark...\"",
      "\"...and he's probably teaching Harry Potter all sorts of\ndreadful things...\"",
      "\"...and he's the worst Defense Professor anyone remembers even\nin Hogwarts, he's not just failing to teach us, he's\ngetting everything wrong, the complete opposite of what it should\nbe...\"",
      "\"...like when he claimed that you could only cast the Killing\nCurse using love, which made it pretty much useless.\"",
      "\"I like that one.\"",
      "\"Thanks.\"",
      "\"I bet the Defense Professor likes it too.\"",
      "\"He does have a sense of humor. He wouldn't have called us what\nhe did if he didn't have a sense of humor.\"",
      "\"But are we really going to be able to do Harry's job?\"",
      "\"Harry said to discuss the problem before trying to solve it, so\nlet's do that.\"",
      "The Weasley twins decided that George would be the enthusiastic\none while Fred doubted.",
      "\"It all seems sort of contradictory,\" said Fred. \"He wants it to\nbe ridiculous enough that everyone laughs at Skeeter and knows it's\nwrong, and he wants Skeeter to believe it. We can't do both things\nat the same time.\"",
      "\"We'll have to fake up some evidence to convince Skeeter,\" said\nGeorge.",
      "\"Was that a solution?\" said Fred.",
      "They considered this.",
      "\"Maybe,\" said George, \"but I don't think we should be all\nthat strict about it, do you?\"",
      "The twins shrugged helplessly.",
      "\"So then the fake evidence has to be good enough to convince\nSkeeter,\" said Fred. \"Can we really do that on our own?\"",
      "\"We don't have to do it on our own,\" said George, and pointed to\nthe pile of money. \"We can hire other people to help us.\"",
      "The twins got a thoughtful look on their face.",
      "\"That could use up Harry's budget pretty fast,\" said Fred. \"This\nis a lot of money for us, but it's not a lot of money for someone\nlike Flume.\"",
      "\"Maybe people will give discounts if they know it's for Harry,\"\nsaid George. \"But most importantly of all, whatever we do, it has\nto be impossible.\"",
      "Fred blinked. \"What do you mean, impossible?\u202f\"",
      "\"So impossible that we don't get in trouble, because no one\nbelieves we could have done it. So impossible that even Harry\nstarts wondering. It has to be surreal, it has to make people doubt\ntheir own sanity, it has to be... better than Harry.\"",
      "Fred's eyes were wide in astonishment. This happened sometimes,\nbetween them, but not often. \"But why?\"",
      "\"They were pranks. They were all pranks. The pie was a\nprank. The Remembrall was a prank. Kevin Entwhistle's cat was a\nprank. Snape was a prank. We're the best\npranksters in Hogwarts, are we going to roll over and give up\nwithout a fight?\"",
      "\"He's the Boy-Who-Lived,\" said Fred.",
      "\"And we're the Weasley twins! He's challenging\nus. He said we could do what he does. But I bet he doesn't think\nwe'll ever be as good as him.\"",
      "\"He's right,\" said Fred, feeling rather nervous. The Weasley\ntwins did sometimes disagree even when they had all the\nsame information, but every time they did it seemed unnatural, like\nat least one of them must be doing something wrong. \"This is\nHarry Potter we're talking about. He can do the\nimpossible. We can't.\"",
      "\"Yes we can,\" said George. \"And we have to be more\nimpossible than him.\"",
      "\"But -\" said Fred.",
      "\"It's what Godric Gryffindor would do,\" said George.",
      "That settled it, and the twins snapped back into... whatever it\nwas that was normal for them.",
      "\"All right, then -\"",
      "\"- let's think about it.\""

      "Professor Quirrell's office hours consisted of 11:40 to 11:55 AM\non Thursday. That was for all of his students in all years. It cost\na Quirrell point just to knock on the door, and if he didn't think\nyour reason was worth his time, you would lose another fifty.",
      "Harry knocked on the door.",
      "There was a pause. Then a biting voice said, \"I suppose you may\nas well come in, Mr. Potter.\"",
      "And before Harry could touch the doorknob, the door slammed\nopen, hitting the wall with a sharp crack that sounded like\nsomething might have broken in the wood, or the stone, or both.",
      "Professor Quirrell was leaning back in his chair and reading a\nsuspiciously old-looking book, bound in night-blue leather with\nsilver runes on the spine. His eyes had not moved from the pages.\n\"I am not in a good mood, Mr. Potter. And when I am not a good\nmood, I am not a pleasant person to be around. For your own sake,\nconduct your business quickly and depart.\"",
      "A cold chill seeped from the room, as though it contained\nsomething that cast darkness the way lamps cast light, and which\nhadn't been fully shaded.",
      "Harry was a bit taken aback. Not in a good mood didn't\nquite seem to cover it. What could be bothering Professor Quirrell\nthis much...?",
      "Well, you didn't just walk out on friends when they were feeling\ndown. Harry cautiously advanced into the room. \"Is there anything I\ncan do to help -\"",
      "\"No,\" said Professor Quirrell, still not looking up from the\nbook.",
      "\"I mean, if you've been dealing with idiots and want someone\nsane to talk to...\"",
      "There was a surprisingly long pause.",
      "Professor Quirrell slammed the book shut and it vanished with a\nsmall whispering sound. He looked up, then, and Harry flinched.",
      "\"I suppose an intelligent conversation would be pleasant for\nme at this point,\" said Professor Quirrell in the same\nbiting tone that had invited Harry to enter. \"You are not\nlikely to find it so, be warned.\"",
      "Harry drew a deep breath. \"I promise I won't mind if you snap at\nme. What happened?\"",
      "The cold in the room seemed to deepen. \"A sixth-year Gryffindor\ncast a curse at one of my more promising students, a sixth-year\nSlytherin.\"",
      "Harry swallowed. \"What... sort of curse?\"",
      "And the fury on Professor Quirrell's face was no longer\ncontained. \"Why bother to ask an unimportant question like that,\nMr. Potter? Our friend the sixth-year Gryffindor did not think it\nwas important!\"",
      "\"Are you serious?\u202f\" Harry said before he could stop\nhimself.",
      "\"No, I'm in a terrible mood today for no particular reason.\nYes I'm serious, you fool! He didn't know. He actually\ndidn't know. I didn't believe it until the Aurors confirmed it\nunder Veritaserum. He is in his sixth year at Hogwarts and\nhe cast a high-level Dark curse without knowing what it\ndid.\"",
      "\"You don't mean,\" Harry said, \"that he was mistaken\nabout what it did, that he somehow read the wrong spell description\n-\"",
      "\"All he knew was that it was meant to be directed at an enemy.\nHe knew that was all he knew.\"",
      "And that had been enough to cast the spell. \"I do not understand\nhow anything with that small a brain could walk upright.\"",
      "\"Indeed, Mr. Potter,\" said Professor Quirrell.",
      "There was a pause. Professor Quirrell leaned forward and picked\nup the silver inkwell from his desk, turning it around in his\nhands, staring at it as though wondering how he could go about\ntorturing an inkwell to death.",
      "\"Was the sixth-year Slytherin seriously hurt?\" said Harry.",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"Was the sixth-year Gryffindor raised by Muggles?\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"Is Dumbledore refusing to expel him because the poor boy didn't\nknow?\"",
      "Professor Quirrell's hands whitened on the inkwell. \"Do you\nhave a point, Mr. Potter, or are you just stating the\nobvious?\u202f\"",
      "\"Professor Quirrell,\" said Harry gravely, \"all the Muggle-raised\nstudents in Hogwarts need a safety lecture in which they are told\nthe things so ridiculously obvious that no wizardborn would ever\nthink to mention them. Don't cast curses if you don't know what\nthey do, if you discover something dangerous don't tell the world\nabout it, don't brew high-level potions without supervision in a\nbathroom, the reason why there are underage magic laws, all the\nbasics.\"",
      "\"Why?\" said Professor Quirrell. \"Let the stupid ones die before\nthey breed.\"",
      "\"If you don't mind losing a few sixth-year Slytherins along with\nthem.\"",
      "The inkwell caught fire in Professor Quirrell's hands and burned\nwith a terrible slowness, hideous black-orange flames tearing at\nthe metal and seeming to take tiny bites from it, the silver\ntwisting as it melted, as though it were trying and failing to\nescape. There was a tinny shrieking sound, as though the metal were\nscreaming.",
      "\"I suppose you are right,\" Professor Quirrell said with a\nresigned smile. \"I shall design a lecture to ensure that\nMuggleborns who are too stupid to live do not take anyone valuable\nwith them as they depart.\"",
      "The inkwell went on screaming and burning in Professor\nQuirrell's hands, tiny droplets of metal, still on fire, now\ndripping to the desk, as though the inkwell were crying.",
      "\"You're not running away,\" observed Professor Quirrell.",
      "Harry opened his mouth -",
      "\"If you're about to say you're not scared of me,\" said Professor\nQuirrell, \"don't.\"",
      "\"You are the scariest person I know,\" Harry said, \"and one of\nthe top reasons for that is your control. I simply can't imagine\nhearing that you'd hurt someone you had not made a deliberate\ndecision to hurt.\"",
      "The fire in Professor Quirrell's hands winked out, and he\ncarefully placed the ruined inkwell on his desk. \"You say the\nnicest things, Mr. Potter. Have you been taking lessons in\nflattery? From, perhaps, Mr. Malfoy?\"",
      "Harry kept his expression blank, and realized one second too\nlate that it might as well have been a signed confession. Professor\nQuirrell didn't care what your expression looked like, he cared\nwhich states of mind made it likely.",
      "\"I see,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"Mr. Malfoy is a useful friend\nto have, Mr. Potter, and there is much he can teach you, but I hope\nyou have not made the mistake of trusting him with too many\nconfidences.\"",
      "\"He knows nothing which I fear becoming known,\" said Harry.",
      "\"Well done,\" said Professor Quirrell, smiling slightly. \"So what\nwas your original business here?\"",
      "\"I think I'm done with the preliminary exercises in Occlumency\nand ready for the tutor.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell nodded. \"I shall conduct you to Gringotts\nthis Sunday.\" He paused, looking at Harry, and smiled. \"And we\nmight even make it a little outing, if you like. I've just had a\npleasant thought.\"",
      "Harry nodded, smiling back.",
      "As Harry left the office, he heard Professor Quirrell humming a\nsmall tune.",
      "Harry was glad he'd been able to cheer him up.",
      "That Sunday there seemed to be a rather large number of people\nwhispering in the hallways, at least when Harry Potter walked past\nthem.",
      "And a lot of pointed fingers.",
      "And a great deal of female giggling.",
      "It had started at breakfast, when someone had asked Harry if\nhe'd heard the news, and Harry had quickly interrupted and said\nthat if the news was written by Rita Skeeter then he didn't want to\nhear about it, he wanted to read it in the paper\nhimself.",
      "It had then developed that not many students at Hogwarts got\ncopies of the Daily Prophet, and that the copies which had\nnot already been bought up from their owners were being passed\naround in some sort of complicated order and nobody really knew who\nhad one at the moment...",
      "So Harry had used a Quieting Charm and gone on to eat his\nbreakfast, trusting to his seat-mates to wave off the many, many\nquestioners, and doing his best to ignore the incredulity, the\nlaughter, the congratulatory smiles, the pitying looks, the fearful\nglances, and the dropped plates as new people came down for\nbreakfast and heard.",
      "Harry was feeling rather curious, but it\nreally wouldn't have done to spoil the artistry by hearing\nit secondhand.",
      "He'd done homework in the safety of his trunk for the next\ncouple of hours, after telling his dormmates to come get him if\nanyone found him an original newspaper.",
      "Harry was still ignorant at 10AM, when he'd left Hogwarts in a\ncarriage with Professor Quirrell, who was in the front right, and\ncurrently slumped over in zombie-mode. Harry was sitting diagonally\nacross, as far away as the carriage allowed, in the back left. Even\nso, Harry had a constant feeling of doom as the carriage rattled\nover a small path through a section of non-forbidden forest. It\nmade it a bit hard to read, especially since the material was\ndifficult, and Harry suddenly wished he was reading one of his\nchildhood science fiction books instead -",
      "\"We're outside the wards, Mr. Potter,\" said Professor Quirrell's\nvoice from the front. \"Time to go.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell carefully disembarked from the carriage,\nbracing himself as he stepped down. Harry, on his own side, jumped\noff.",
      "Harry was wondering exactly how they'd get there when Professor\nQuirrell said \"Catch!\" and threw a bronze Knut at him, and Harry\ncaught it without thinking.",
      "A giant intangible hook caught at Harry's abdomen and yanked him\nback, hard, only without any sense of acceleration, and an instant\nlater Harry was standing in the middle of Diagon Alley.",
      "(Excuse me, what? said his brain.)",
      "(We just teleported, explained Harry.)",
      "(That didn't used to happen in the ancestral\nenvironment, Harry's brain complained, and disoriented\nhim.)",
      "Harry staggered as his feet adjusted to the brick of the street\ninstead of the dirt of the forest corridor they had been\ntraversing. He straightened, still dizzy, with the bustling witches\nand wizards seeming to sway slightly, and the cries of the\nshopkeepers seeming to move around in his hearing, as his brain\ntried to place a world to be located in.",
      "Moments later, there was a sort of sucking-popping sound from a\nfew paces behind Harry, and when Harry turned to look Professor\nQuirrell was there.",
      "\"Do you mind -\" said Harry, at the same time as Professor\nQuirrell said, \"I'm afraid I -\"",
      "Harry stopped, Professor Quirrell didn't.",
      "\"- need to go off and set something in motion, Mr. Potter. As it\nhas been thoroughly explained to me that I am responsible for\nanything whatsoever that happens to you, I'll be leaving you with\n-\"",
      "\"Newsstand,\" Harry said.",
      "\"Pardon?\"",
      "\"Or anywhere I can buy a copy of the Daily Prophet. Put\nme there and I'll be happy.\"",
      "Shortly after, Harry had been delivered into a bookstore,\naccompanied by several quietly spoken, ambiguous threats. And the\nshopkeeper had gotten less ambiguous threats, judging by\nthe way he had cringed, and how his eyes now kept darting between\nHarry and the entrance.",
      "If the bookstore burned down, Harry was going to stick around in\nthe middle of the fire until Professor Quirrell got back.",
      "Meanwhile -",
      "Harry took a quick glance around.",
      "The bookstore seemed rather small and shoddy, with only four\nrows of bookcases visible, and the nearest shelf Harry's eyes had\njumped to seemed to deal with narrow, cheaply bound books with grim\ntitles like The Massacre of Albania in the Fifteenth\nCentury.",
      "First things first. Harry stepped over to the seller's\ncounter.",
      "\"Pardon me,\" said Harry, \"One copy of the Daily\nProphet, please.\"",
      "\"Five Sickles,\" said the shopkeeper. \"Sorry, kid, I've only got\nthree left.\"",
      "Five Sickles dropped onto the counter. Harry had the feeling he\ncould have bargained him down a couple of points, but at this point\nhe didn't really care.",
      "The shopkeeper's eyes widened and he seemed to really notice\nHarry for the first time. \"You!\u202f\"",
      "\"Me!\u202f\"",
      "\"Is it true? Are you really -\"",
      "\"Shut up! Sorry, I've been waiting all day to\nread this in the original newspaper instead of hearing about it\nsecondhand, so please just hand it over, all right?\"",
      "The shopkeeper stared at Harry for a moment, then wordlessly\nreached under the counter and passed over one folded copy of the\nDaily Prophet.",
      "The headline read:",
      "HARRY POTTER\nSECRETLY BETROTHED\nTO GINEVRA WEASLEY",
      "Harry stared.",
      "He lifted the newspaper off the counter, softly, reverently,\nlike he was handling an original Escher artwork, and unbent it to\nread...",
      "...about the evidence that had convinced Rita Skeeter.",
      "...and some interesting further details.",
      "...and yet more evidence.",
      "Fred and George had cleared it with their sister first, surely?\nYes, of course they had. There was a picture of Ginevra Weasley\nsighing longingly over what Harry could see, looking closely, was a\nphoto of himself. That had to have been staged.",
      "But how on Earth...?",
      "Harry was sitting in a cheap folding chair, rereading the\nnewspaper for the fourth time, when the door whispered softly and\nProfessor Quirrell came back into the shop.",
      "\"My apologies for - what in Merlin's name are you\nreading?\"",
      "\"It would seem,\" said Harry, awe in his voice, \"that one Mr.\nArthur Weasley was placed under the Imperius Curse by a Death Eater\nwhom my father killed, thus creating a debt to House Potter, which\nmy father demanded be repaid by the hand in marriage of the\nrecently born Ginevra Weasley. Do people actually do that sort of\nthing around here?\"",
      "\"How could Miss Skeeter possibly be fool enough to\nbelieve -\"",
      "And Professor Quirrell's voice cut off.",
      "Harry had been reading the newspaper held vertically and\nunfolded, which meant that Professor Quirrell, from where he was\nstanding, could see the text underneath the headline.",
      "The look of shock on Professor Quirrell's face was a work of art\nalmost on par with the newspaper itself.",
      "\"Don't worry,\" said Harry cheerfully, \"it's all fake.\"",
      "From elsewhere in the store, he heard the shopkeeper gasp. There\nwas the sound of a stack of books falling over.",
      "\"Mr. Potter...\" Professor Quirrell said slowly, \"are you\nsure of that?\"",
      "\"Quite sure. Shall we go?\"",
      "Professor Quirrell nodded, looking rather abstracted, and Harry\nfolded the newspaper back up, and followed him out of the door.",
      "For some reason Harry didn't seem to be hearing any street\nnoises now.",
      "They walked in silence for thirty seconds before Professor\nQuirrell spoke. \"Miss Skeeter viewed the original proceedings of\nthe restricted Wizengamot session.\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"The original proceedings of the Wizengamot.\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"I would have trouble doing that.\"",
      "\"Really?\" said Harry. \"Because if my suspicions are correct,\nthis was done by a Hogwarts student.\"",
      "\"That is beyond impossible,\" Professor Quirrell said flatly.\n\"Mr. Potter... I regret to say that this young lady expects to\nmarry you.\"",
      "\"But that is improbable,\" said Harry. \"To quote Douglas\nAdams, the impossible often has a kind of integrity which the\nmerely improbable lacks.\"",
      "\"I see your point,\" Professor Quirrell said slowly. \"But... no,\nMr. Potter. It may be impossible, but I can imagine\ntampering with the Wizengamot proceedings. It is\nunimaginable that the Grand Manager of Gringotts should\naffix the seal of his office in witness to a false betrothal\ncontract, and Miss Skeeter personally verified that seal.\"",
      "\"Indeed,\" said Harry, \"you would expect the Grand Manager of\nGringotts to get involved with that much money changing hands. It\nseems Mr. Weasley was greatly in debt, and so demanded an\nadditional payment of ten thousand Galleons -\"",
      "\"Ten thousand Galleons for a Weasley? You\ncould buy the daughter of a Noble House for that!\"",
      "\"Excuse me,\" Harry said. \"I really have to ask at this point, do\npeople actually do that sort of thing around here -\"",
      "\"Rarely,\" said Professor Quirrell, with a frown on his face.\n\"And not at all, I suspect, since the Dark Lord departed. I suppose\nthat according to the newspaper, your father just paid it?\"",
      "\"He didn't have any choice,\" said Harry. \"Not if he wanted to\nfulfill the conditions of the prophecy.\"",
      "\"Give me that,\" said Professor Quirrell, and the\nnewspaper leaped out of Harry's hand so fast that he got a paper\ncut.",
      "Harry automatically put the finger in his mouth to suck on,\nfeeling rather shocked, and turned to remonstrate with Professor\nQuirrell -",
      "Professor Quirrell had stopped short in the middle of the\nstreet, and his eyes were flickering rapidly back and forth as an\ninvisible force held the newspaper suspended before him.",
      "Harry watched, gaping in open awe, as the newspaper opened to\nreveal pages two and three. And not much long after, four and five.\nIt was like the man had cast off a pretense of mortality.",
      "And after a troublingly short time, the paper neatly folded\nitself up again. Professor Quirrell plucked it from the air and\ntossed it to Harry, who caught it in sheer reflex; and then\nProfessor Quirrell started walking again, and Harry automatically\ntrudged after.",
      "\"No,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"that prophecy didn't sound quite\nright to me either.\"",
      "Harry nodded, still stunned.",
      "\"The centaurs could have been put under an Imperius,\"\nProfessor Quirrell said, frowning, \"that seems\nunderstandable. What magic can make, magic can corrupt, and it is\nnot unthinkable that the Great Seal of Gringotts could be twisted\nto another's hand. The Unspeakable could have been impersonated\nwith Polyjuice, likewise the Bavarian seer. And with\nenough effort it might be possible to tamper with the\nproceedings of the Wizengamot. Do you have any idea how that was\ndone?\"",
      "\"I do not have one single plausible hypothesis,\" said Harry. \"I\ndo know it was done on a total budget of forty Galleons.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell stopped short and whirled on Harry. His\nexpression was now completely incredulous. \"Forty Galleons will pay\na competent ward-breaker to open a path into a home you wish to\nburglarize! Forty thousand Galleons might pay a\nteam of the greatest professional criminals in the world to tamper\nwith the proceedings of the Wizengamot!\"",
      "Harry shrugged helplessly. \"I'll remember that the next time I\nwant to save thirty-nine thousand, nine hundred and sixty Galleons\nby finding the right contractor.\"",
      "\"I do not say this often,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"I am\nimpressed.\"",
      "\"Likewise,\" said Harry.",
      "\"And who is this incredible Hogwarts student?\"",
      "\"I'm afraid I couldn't say.\"",
      "Somewhat to Harry's surprise, Professor Quirrell made no\nobjection to this.",
      "They walked in the direction of the Gringotts building,\nthinking, for they were neither of them the sort of person who\nwould give up on the problem without considering it for at least\nfive minutes.",
      "\"I have a feeling,\" Harry said finally, \"that we're coming at\nthis from the wrong angle. There's a tale I once heard about some\nstudents who came into a physics class, and the teacher showed them\na large metal plate near a fire. She ordered them to feel the metal\nplate, and they felt that the metal nearer the fire was cooler, and\nthe metal further away was warmer. And she said, write down your\nguess for why this happens. So some students wrote down 'because of\nhow the metal conducts heat', and some students wrote down 'because\nof how the air moves', and no one said 'this just seems\nimpossible', and the real answer was that before the students came\ninto the room, the teacher turned the plate around.\"",
      "\"Interesting,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"That does sound\nsimilar. Is there a moral?\"",
      "\"That your strength as a rationalist is your ability to be more\nconfused by fiction than by reality,\" said Harry. \"If you're\nequally good at explaining any outcome, you have zero knowledge.\nThe students thought they could use words like 'because of heat\nconduction' to explain anything, even a metal plate being cooler on\nthe side nearer the fire. So they didn't notice how confused they\nwere, and that meant they couldn't be more confused by falsehood\nthan by truth. If you tell me that the centaurs were under the\nImperius Curse, I still have the feeling of something\nbeing not quite right. I notice that I'm still confused even after\nhearing your explanation.\"",
      "\"Hm,\" said Professor Quirrell.",
      "They walked on further.",
      "\"I don't suppose,\" said Harry, \"that it's possible to\nactually swap people into alternate universes? Like, this\nisn't our own Rita Skeeter, or they temporarily sent her somewhere\nelse?\"",
      "\"If that was possible,\" Professor Quirrell said, his\nvoice rather dry, \"would I still be here?\u202f\"",
      "And just as they were almost to the huge white front of the\nGringotts building, Professor Quirrell said:",
      "\"Ah. Of course. I see it now. Let me guess, the Weasley\ntwins?\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" said Harry, his voice going up another octave\nin pitch. \"How?\u202f\"",
      "\"I'm afraid I couldn't say.\"",
      "\"...That is not fair.\"",
      "\"I think it is extremely fair,\" said Professor Quirrell, and\nthey entered through the bronze doors.",
      "The time was just before noon, and Harry and Professor Quirrell\nwere seated at the foot and head of a wide, long, flat table, in a\nsumptuously appointed private room with thoroughly cushioned\ncouches and chairs along the walls, and soft curtains hanging\neverywhere.",
      "They were about to eat lunch in Mary's Place, which Professor\nQuirrell had said was known to him as one of the best restaurants\nin Diagon Alley, especially for - his voice had dropped\nmeaningfully - certain purposes.",
      "It was the nicest restaurant that Harry had ever been in, and it\nwas really eating away at Harry that Professor Quirrell was\ntreating him to the meal.",
      "The first part of the mission, to find an Occlumency instructor,\nhad been a success. Professor Quirrell, smiling evilly, had told\nGriphook to recommend the best he knew, and not worry about the\nexpense, since Dumbledore was paying it; and the goblin had smiled\nin return. There might have been a certain amount of smiling on\nHarry's part as well.",
      "The second part of the plan had been a complete failure.",
      "Harry was not allowed to take money out of his vault without\nHeadmaster Dumbledore or some other school official present, and\nProfessor Quirrell had not been given the vault key. Harry's Muggle\nparents could not authorize it because they were Muggles, and\nMuggles had around the same legal standing as children or kittens:\nthey were cute, so if you tortured them in public you could get\narrested, but they weren't people. Some reluctant\nprovision had been made for recognizing the parents of Muggleborns\nas human in a limited sense, but Harry's adoptive parents did not\nfall into that legal category.",
      "It seemed that Harry was effectively an orphan in the eyes of\nthe wizarding world. As such, the Headmaster of Hogwarts, or his\ndesignees within the school system, were Harry's guardians\nuntil he graduated. Harry could breathe without\nDumbledore's permission, but only so long as the Headmaster did not\nspecifically prohibit it.",
      "Harry had then asked if he could simply tell Griphook\nhow to diversify his investments beyond stacks of gold coins\nsitting in his vault.",
      "Griphook had stared blankly and asked what 'diversify'\nmeant.",
      "Banks, it seemed, did not make investments. Banks stored your\ngold coins in secure vaults for an annual fee.",
      "The wizarding world did not have a concept of stock. Or equity.\nOr corporations. Businesses were run by families out of their\npersonal vaults.",
      "Loans were made by rich people, not banks. Though Gringotts\nwould witness the contract, for a fee, and enforce its collection,\nfor a much larger fee.",
      "Good rich people let their friends borrow money and pay it back\nwhenever. Bad rich people charged you\ninterest.",
      "There was no secondary market in loans.",
      "Evil rich people charged you annual interest rates of at least\n20%.",
      "Harry had stood up, turned away, and rested his head against the\nwall.",
      "Harry had asked if he needed the Headmaster's permission before\nhe could start a bank.",
      "Professor Quirrell had interrupted at this point, saying that it\nwas time for lunch, and swiftly conducted a fuming Harry out of the\nbronze doors of Gringotts, through Diagon Alley, and to a fine\nrestaurant called Mary's Place, where a room had been reserved for\nthem. The owner had looked shocked at seeing Professor Quirrell\naccompanied by Harry Potter, but had conducted them to the room\nwithout complaint.",
      "And Professor Quirrell had quite deliberately announced that he\nwould pay the bill, seeming to rather enjoy the look on Harry's\nface.",
      "\"No,\" said Professor Quirrell to the waitress, \"we will not\nrequire menus. I will have the daily special accompanied by a\nbottle of Chianti, and Mr. Potter will have the Diracawl soup to\nstart, followed by a plate of Roopo balls, and treacle pudding for\ndessert.\"",
      "The waitress, clad in robes that still looked severe and formal\nwhile being rather shorter than usual, bowed respectfully and\ndeparted, shutting the door behind her.",
      "Professor Quirrell waved a hand in the direction of the door,\nand a bolt slid shut. \"Note the bolt on the inside. This room, Mr.\nPotter, is known as Mary's Room. It happens to be proof against all\nscrying, and I do mean all; Dumbledore himself could\ndetect nothing of what happens here. Mary's Room is used by two\nkinds of people. The first sort are engaged in illicit dalliances.\nAnd the second sort lead interesting lives.\"",
      "\"Really,\" said Harry.",
      "Professor Quirrell nodded.",
      "Harry's lips were parted in anticipation. \"It would be a waste\nto just sit here and eat lunch, then, without doing anything\nspecial.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell grinned, then took out his wand and flicked\nit in the direction of the door. \"Of course,\" he said, \"people who\nlead interesting lives take precautions more thorough than\nthe dalliers. I have just sealed us in. Nothing will now pass in or\nout of this room - through the crack under the door, for example.\nAnd...\"",
      "Professor Quirrell then spoke no fewer than four different\nCharms, none of which Harry recognized.",
      "\"Even that does not really suffice,\" said Professor\nQuirrell. \"If we were doing anything of truly great import, it\nwould be necessary to perform another twenty-three checks besides\nthose. If, say, Rita Skeeter knew or guessed that we would come\nhere, it is possible that she could be in this room wearing the\ntrue Cloak of Invisibility. Or she could be an Animagus with a tiny\nform, perhaps. There are tests to rule out such rare possibilities,\nbut to perform all of them would be arduous. Still, I wonder if I\nshould do them anyway, just so as not to teach you bad habits?\" And\nProfessor Quirrell tapped a finger on his cheek, looking\nabstracted.",
      "\"It's fine,\" Harry said, \"I understand, and I'll remember.\"\nThough he was a little disappointed that they weren't doing\nanything of truly great import.",
      "\"Very well,\" Professor Quirrell said. He leaned back in his\nchair, smiling broadly. \"You wrought quite well today, Mr. Potter.\nThe basic notion was yours, I'm sure, even if you delegated the\nexecution. I don't think we'll be hearing much more from Rita\nSkeeter after this. Lucius Malfoy will not be pleased with her\nfailure. If she's smart, she'll flee the country the instant she\nrealizes she's been fooled.\"",
      "A sinking sensation began to dawn in Harry's stomach. \"Lucius\nwas behind Rita Skeeter...?\"",
      "\"Oh, you didn't realize that?\" said Professor Quirrell.",
      "Harry hadn't thought about what would happen to Rita Skeeter\nafterward.",
      "At all.",
      "Not in the slightest.",
      "But she would get fired from her job, of course she\nwould be fired, she might have children going through Hogwarts for\nall Harry knew, and now it was worse, much worse -",
      "\"Is Lucius going to have her killed?\" Harry said in a barely\naudible voice. Somewhere in his head, the Sorting Hat was screaming\nat him.",
      "Professor Quirrell smiled dryly. \"If you have not dealt with\njournalists before, take it from me that the world gets a little\nbrighter every time one dies.\"",
      "Harry jumped out of his chair with a convulsive movement, he had\nto find Rita Skeeter and warn her before it was too late -",
      "\"Sit down,\" Professor Quirrell said sharply.\n\"No, Lucius won't kill her. But Lucius makes life\nextremely unpleasant for those who serve him ill. Miss\nSkeeter will flee and start her life over with a new name. Sit\ndown, Mr. Potter; there is nothing you can do at this point,\nand you have a lesson to learn.\"",
      "Harry sat down, slowly. There was a disappointed, annoyed look\non Professor Quirrell's face that was doing more to stop him than\nthe words.",
      "\"There are times,\" Professor Quirrell said, his voice cutting,\n\"when I worry that your brilliant Slytherin mind is simply wasted\non you. Repeat after me. Rita Skeeter was a vile, disgusting\nwoman.\"",
      "\"Rita Skeeter was a vile, disgusting woman,\" Harry said. He\nwasn't comfortable saying it, but there didn't seem to be any other\npossible actions, none at all.",
      "\"Rita Skeeter tried to destroy my reputation, but I executed an\ningenious plan and destroyed her reputation first.\"",
      "\"Rita Skeeter challenged me. She lost the game, and I won.\"",
      "\"Rita Skeeter was an obstacle to my future plans. I had no\nchoice but to deal with her if I wanted those plans to\nsucceed.\"",
      "\"Rita Skeeter was my enemy.\"",
      "\"I cannot possibly get anything done in life if I am not willing\nto defeat my enemies.\"",
      "\"I have defeated one of my enemies today.\"",
      "\"I am a good boy.\"",
      "\"I deserve a special reward.\"",
      "\"Ah,\" said Professor Quirrell, who had been grinning a\nbenevolent smile for the last few lines, \"I see I have succeeded in\ncatching your attention.\"",
      "That was true. And while Harry felt like he was being railroaded\ninto something - no, that wasn't just a feeling, he had\nbeen railroaded - he couldn't deny that saying those things, and\nseeing Professor Quirrell's smile, did make him feel\nbetter.",
      "Professor Quirrell reached into his robes, the gesture slow and\ndeliberately significant, and drew forth...",
      "...a book.",
      "It was different from any book Harry had ever seen, the edges\nand corners visibly misshapen; rough-hewn was the phrase\nthat came to mind, like it had been hacked out of a book mine.",
      "\"What is it?\" breathed Harry.",
      "\"A diary,\" said Professor Quirrell.",
      "\"Whose?\"",
      "\"That of a famous person.\" Professor Quirrell was smiling\nbroadly.",
      "\"Okay...\"",
      "Professor Quirrell's expression became more serious. \"Mr.\nPotter, one of the requisites for becoming a powerful wizard is an\nexcellent memory. The key to a puzzle is often something you read\ntwenty years ago in an old scroll, or a peculiar ring you saw on\nthe finger of a man you met only once. I mention this to explain\nhow I managed to remember this item, and the placard attached to\nit, after meeting you a good deal later. You see, Mr. Potter, over\nthe course of my life, I have viewed a number of private\ncollections held by individuals who are, perhaps, not quite\ndeserving of all that they have -\"",
      "\"You stole it?\" Harry said incredulously.",
      "\"That is correct,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"Very recently, in\nfact. I think you will appreciate this particular item much more\nthan the vile little man who held it for no other purpose than\nimpressing his equally vile friends with its rarity.\"",
      "Harry was simply gaping now.",
      "\"But if you feel that my actions were incorrect, Mr. Potter, I\nsuppose you needn't accept your special present. Though of course I\nshan't go to the trouble of stealing it back. So which is\nit to be?\"",
      "Professor Quirrell tossed the book from one hand to another,\ncausing Harry to reach out involuntarily with a look of dismay.",
      "\"Oh,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"don't worry about a little rough\nhandling. You could toss this diary in a fireplace and it would\nemerge unscathed. In any case, I await your decision.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell casually threw the book up into the air and\ncaught it again, grinning.",
      "No, said Gryffindor and Hufflepuff.",
      "Yes, said Ravenclaw. What part of the word 'book'\ndid you two not understand?",
      "The theft part, said Hufflepuff.",
      "Oh, come on, said Ravenclaw, you can't seriously\nask us to say no and spend the rest of our life wondering what it\nwas.",
      "It sounds like a net positive from a utilitarian\nstandpoint, said Slytherin. Think of it as an economic\ntransaction which generates gains from trade, only without the\ntrade part. Plus, we didn't steal it and it won't\nhelp anyone to have Professor Quirrell keep it.",
      "He's trying to turn you Dark! shrieked Gryffindor, and\nHufflepuff nodded firmly.",
      "Don't be a naive little boy, said Slytherin, he's\ntrying to teach you Slytherin.",
      "Yeah, said Ravenclaw. Whoever owned the book\noriginally was probably a Death Eater or something. It belongs with\nus.",
      "Harry's mouth opened, then halted that way, an agonized look on\nhis face.",
      "Professor Quirrell seemed to be quite enjoying himself. He had\nbalanced the book on its corner, on one finger, and was keeping it\nupright while humming a little tune.",
      "There came a knock at the door.",
      "The book vanished back into Professor Quirrell's robes, and he\nrose up from his chair. Professor Quirrell started to walk over to\nthe door -",
      "- and staggered, suddenly lurching into the wall.",
      "\"It's all right,\" said Professor Quirrell's voice, which\nsuddenly sounded a lot weaker than usual. \"Sit down, Mr. Potter,\nit's just a dizzy spell. Sit down.\"",
      "Harry's fingers gripped the edge of his chair, uncertain as to\nwhat he should do, what he could do. Harry couldn't even\nget too close to Professor Quirrell, not unless he wanted to defy\nthat sense of Doom -",
      "Professor Quirrell straightened, then, his breathing seeming a\nbit heavy, and opened the door.",
      "The waitress came in, bearing a platter of food; and as she\ndistributed the plates, Professor Quirrell walked slowly back to\nthe table.",
      "But by the time the waitress had bowed her way out, Professor\nQuirrell was sitting upright and smiling again.",
      "Still, the brief episode of whatever-it-was had decided Harry.\nHe couldn't say no, not after Professor Quirrell had gone to that\nmuch trouble.",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry said.",
      "Professor Quirrell held up a cautioning finger, then took out\nhis wand again, locked the door again, and repeated three of the\nsame Charms from earlier.",
      "Then Professor Quirrell took the book back out of his robes and\ntossed it to Harry, who almost dropped it into his soup.",
      "Harry shot Professor Quirrell a look of helpless indignation.\nYou weren't supposed to do that with books, enchanted or\nnot.",
      "Harry opened the book with ingrained, instinctive care. The\npages seemed too thick, with a texture unlike either Muggle paper\nor wizarding parchment. And the contents were...",
      "...blank?",
      "\"Am I supposed to be seeing -\"",
      "\"Look nearer the beginning,\" said Professor Quirrell, and Harry\n(again with that helpless, ingrained care) turned a block of pages\nback.",
      "The lettering was obviously handwritten, and very hard to read,\nbut Harry thought the words might be Latin.",
      "\"What is this?\" said Harry.",
      "\"That,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"is a record of the magical\nresearches of a Muggleborn who never came to Hogwarts. He refused\nhis letter, and conducted his own small investigations, which never\ndid get very far without a wand. From the description on the\nplacard, I expect that his name bears rather more significance to\nyou than to me. That, Harry Potter, is the diary of Roger\nBacon.\"",
      "Harry almost fainted.",
      "Nestled up against the wall, where Professor Quirrell had\nstumbled, glistened the crushed remains of a beautiful blue\nbeetle."

      "\"Pleeaaase,\" whined Harry Potter.",
      "Fred and George shook their heads again, smiling.",
      "There was an agonized look on Harry Potter's face. \"But I\ntold you how I did the one with Kevin Entwhistle's cat,\nand Hermione and the vanishing soda, and I can't tell you\nabout the Sorting Hat or the Remembrall or Professor Snape...\"",

      "Then they turned a corner and their faces sagged.",
      "\"I don't suppose Harry's guesses -\"",
      "\"- gave you any ideas?\" they said to each other at the same\ntime, and then their shoulders slumped further.",
      "Their last relevant memory was of Flume refusing to help them,\nthough they couldn't remember what they'd asked him to\ndo...",
      "...but they must have looked elsewhere and found\nsomeone to help them do something illegal, or\nthey wouldn't have agreed to be Obliviated afterward.",
      "How had they possibly been able to get all that done on\njust forty Galleons?",
      "At first they'd worried that they'd forged evidence so good that\nHarry actually would end up married to Ginny... but they'd\nthought of that too, it seemed. The Wizengamot proceedings had been\ntampered with again to put them back the way they'd been\noriginally, the fake betrothal contract had vanished from its\ndragon-guarded vault in Gringotts, and so on. It was pretty scary,\nactually. Most people now thought the Daily Prophet had\njust made the whole thing up for unguessable reasons, and the\nQuibbler had helpfully twisted the knife deeper with the\nnext day's headline, HARRY POTTER SECRETLY BETROTHED TO LUNA\nLOVEGOOD.",
      "Whoever they'd hired would tell them after the statute of\nlimitations expired, they desperately hoped. But meanwhile it was\nawful, they'd pulled their greatest prank ever, maybe the greatest\nprank in the history of pranking, and they couldn't remember\nhow. It was crazy, they'd been able to think of a way the\nfirst time, so why couldn't they see it now after\nknowing everything they'd done?",
      "Their only consolation was that Harry didn't know they didn't\nknow.",
      "Not even Mum had questioned them about it, despite the obvious\nWeasley connection. Whatever had been done, it was far out of the\nreach of any Hogwarts student... except possibly one, who,\nif certain rumors were true, might have done it by snapping his\nfingers. Harry had been questioned under Veritaserum, he'd\ntold them... with Dumbledore present and giving the Aurors scary\nlooks. The Aurors had asked just enough to determine that Harry\nhadn't pulled the prank himself or disappeared anyone, and then\ngotten the heck out of Hogwarts.",
      "Fred and George had wondered whether to feel insulted about\nHarry Potter being questioned by the Aurors for their\nprank, but the look on Harry's face, probably for exactly\nthe same reason, made everything worth it.",
      "Unsurprisingly, Rita Skeeter and the editor of the Daily\nProphet had both vanished and were probably in another country\nby now. They would've liked to be able to tell their\nfamily about that part. Dad would have congratulated them, they\nthought, after Mum had finished killing them and Ginny had burned\nthe remains.",
      "But everything was still all right, they'd tell Dad someday, and\nmeanwhile...",
      "...meanwhile Dumbledore had happened to sneeze while passing\nthem in the hallway, and a small package had accidentally dropped\nout of his pockets, and inside had been two matched wardbreaker's\nmonocles of incredible quality. The Weasley twins had\ntested their new monocles on the \"forbidden\" third-floor corridor,\nmaking a quick trip to the magic mirror and back, and they hadn't\nbeen able to see all the detection webs clearly, but the\nmonocles had shown a lot more than they'd seen the first\ntime.",
      "Of course they would have to be very careful never to get caught\nwith the monocles in their possession, or they would end up in the\nHeadmaster's office getting a stern lecture and maybe even threats\nof expulsion.",
      "It was good to know that not everyone who got Sorted into\nGryffindor grew up to be Professor McGonagall.",
      "Harry was in a white room, windowless, featureless, sitting\nbefore a desk, facing an expressionless man in formal robes of\nsolid black.",
      "The room was screened against detection, and the man had\nperformed exactly twenty-seven spells before saying so much as\n\"Hello, Mr. Potter.\"",
      "It was oddly appropriate that the man in black was about to try\nreading Harry's mind.",
      "\"Prepare yourself,\" the man said tonelessly.",
      "A human mind, Harry's Occlumency book had said, was only exposed\nto a Legilimens along certain surfaces. If you failed to\ndefend your surfaces, the Legilimens would go through and\nbe able to access any part of you which their own mind was able to\ncomprehend...",
      "...which tended not to be much. Human minds, it seemed, were\nhard for humans to understand on any level but the shallowest.\nHarry had wondered if knowing lots of cognitive science could make\nhim an incredibly powerful Legilimens, but repeated experience had\nfinally driven into him the lesson that he needed to get a\nlittle less excited in his anticipations about this sort of thing.\nIt wasn't as if any cognitive scientist understood humans well\nenough to make one.",
      "To learn the counter, Occlumency, the first step was to imagine\nyourself to be a different person, pretending it as thoroughly as\nyou could, immersing yourself entirely in that alternate persona.\nYou wouldn't always have to do that, but in the beginning, it was\nhow you learned where your surfaces were. The Legilimens would try\nto read you, and you would feel it happening if you paid close\nenough attention, you would sense them trying to enter. And your\njob was to make sure that they always touched your imaginary\npersona and not the real one.",
      "When you were good enough at that, you could imagine being a\nvery simple sort of person, pretend to be a rock, and make\na habit of leaving the pretense in place where all your surfaces\nwere. That was a standard Occlumency barrier. Pretending to be a\nrock was hard to learn, but easy to do afterward, and the exposed\nsurface of a mind was much shallower than its interior, so with\nenough practice you could keep it up as a background habit.",
      "Or if you were a perfect Occlumens, you could race\nahead of any probes, answering queries as fast as they\nwere asked, so that the Legilimens would enter through your\nsurfaces and see a mind indistinguishable from whoever you were\npretending to be.",
      "Even the best Legilimens could be fooled that way. If a perfect\nOcclumens claimed they were dropping their Occlumency barriers,\nthere was no way to know if they were lying. Worse, you might not\nknow you were dealing with a perfect Occlumens. They were rare, but\nthe fact that they existed meant you couldn't trust Legilimency on\nanyone.",
      "It was a sad commentary on how little human beings understood\neach other, how little any wizard comprehended the depths lying\nbeneath the mind's surface, that you could fool the best human\ntelepaths by pretending to be someone else.",
      "But then human beings only understood each other in the first\nplace by pretending. You didn't make predictions about people by\nmodeling the hundred trillion synapses in their brain as separate\nobjects. Ask the best social manipulator on Earth to build you an\nArtificial Intelligence from scratch, and they'd just give you a\ndumb look. You predicted people by telling your brain to\nact like theirs. You put yourself in their place. If you\nwanted to know what an angry person would do, you activated your\nown brain's anger circuitry, and whatever that circuitry output,\nthat was your prediction. What did the neural circuitry for anger\nactually look like inside? Who knew? The best social manipulator on\nEarth might not know what neurons were, and neither might\nthe best Legilimens.",
      "Anything a Legilimens could understand, an Occlumens\ncould pretend to be. It was the same trick either way -\nprobably implemented by the same neural circuitry in both cases, a\nsingle set of control circuits for reconfiguring your own brain to\nact as a model of someone else's.",
      "And so the race between telepathic offense and telepathic\ndefense had been a decisive win for defense. Otherwise the entire\nmagical world, maybe even the whole Earth, would have been a very\ndifferent place...",
      "Harry took a deep breath, and concentrated. There was a slight\nsmile on his face.",
      "For once, just once, Harry hadn't gotten\nshortchanged in the mysterious powers department.",
      "After almost a month of work, and more on a whim than any real\nhunch, Harry had decided to make himself coldly angry and then try\nthe book's Occlumency exercises again. At that point he'd mostly\ngiven up hope on that sort of thing, but it had still seemed worth\na quick try -",
      "He'd run through all the book's hardest exercises in two hours,\nand the next day he'd gone and told Professor Quirrell he was\nready.",
      "His dark side, it had turned out, was very, very good\nat pretending to be other people.",
      "Harry thought of his standard trigger, from the first time he'd\ngone over entirely to his dark side...",
      "Severus paused, looking quite pleased with himself. \"And\nthat will be... five points? No, let us make it an even ten points\nfrom Ravenclaw for backchat.\"",
      "Harry's smile grew chillier, and he regarded the black-robed man\nwho thought he was going to read Harry's mind.",
      "And then Harry turned into someone else entirely, someone who\nhad seemed appropriate to the occasion.",
      "...in a white room, windowless, featureless, sitting before a\ndesk, facing an expressionless man in formal robes of solid\nblack.",
      "Kimball Kinnison regarded the black-robed man who thought he was\ngoing to read the mind of a Second-Stage Lensman of the Galactic\nPatrol.",
      "To say that Kimball Kinnison was confident of the outcome would\nbe an understatement. He had been trained by Mentor of Arisia, the\nmost powerful mind known to this or any other universe, and the\nmere wizard sitting across from him would see precisely what the\nGray Lensman wanted him to see...",
      "...the mind of the boy he was currently disguised as, an\ninnocent child named Harry Potter.",
      "\"I'm ready,\" said Kimball Kinnison in nervous tones that were\nexactly appropriate for an eleven-year-old boy.",
      "\"Legilimens,\" said the black-robed wizard.",
      "There was a pause.",
      "The black-robed wizard blinked, as if he'd seen something so\nshocking that it had been enough to make even his eyelids\nmove. His voice wasn't quite toneless as he said, \"The\nBoy-Who-Lived has a mysterious dark side?\u202f\"",
      "The heat slowly crept up into Harry's cheeks.",
      "\"Well,\" the man said. His face had now settled back into perfect\ncalm. \"Excuse me. Mr. Potter, it is good to know your advantages,\nbut that is not the same as being wildly overconfident in them. You\nmay indeed be able to learn Occlumency at eleven years of age. This\nastounds me. I had thought Mr. Dumbledore was pretending to be\ninsane again. Your dissociative talent is so strong that I am\nsurprised to find no other signs of childhood abuse, and you may\nbecome a perfect Occlumens in time. But there is a considerable\ndifference between that and expecting to put up a successful\nOcclumency barrier on your first attempt. That is merely\nridiculous. Did you feel anything as I read your mind?\"",
      "Harry shook his head, now blushing furiously.",
      "\"Then pay closer attention next time. The goal is not to create\na perfect image on your first day of lessons. The goal is to learn\nwhere your surfaces are. Prepare yourself.\"",
      "Harry tried to pretend to be Kimball Kinnison again, tried to\npay more attention, but his thoughts were a little scattered and he\nwas suddenly aware of all the things he shouldn't be thinking\nabout...",
      "Oh, this was going to suck.",
      "Harry gritted his teeth. At least the instructor would be\nObliviated afterward.",
      "\"Legilimens.\"",
      "There was a pause -",
      "...in a white room, windowless, featureless, sitting before a\ndesk, facing an expressionless man in formal robes of solid\nblack.",
      "It was their fourth day, on a Sunday evening. When you paid this\nmuch, you got your sessions any darned time you wanted, never mind\nthe concept of weekends.",
      "\"Hello, Mr. Potter,\" the telepath said tonelessly, having cast\nthe full suite of privacy spells.",
      "\"Hello, Mr. Bester,\" Harry said wearily. \"Let's just get the\ninitial shock out of the way, shall we?\"",
      "\"You managed to surprise me?\" the man said, now sounding\nslightly interested. \"Well then.\" He pointed his wand and stared\ninto Harry's eyes. \"Legilimens.\"",
      "There was a pause, and then the black-robed wizard jerked as if\nsomeone had touched him with a cattle prod.",
      "\"The Dark Lord is alive?\u202f\" he choked. His eyes were\nsuddenly wild. \"Dumbledore turns himself invisible and sneaks\ninto girls' dorm rooms?\u202f\"",
      "Harry sighed and looked down at his watch. In about another\nthree seconds...",
      "\"So,\" the man said. He hadn't quite recovered his tonelessness.\n\"You genuinely believe you're going to discover the secret rules of\nmagic and become all-powerful.\"",
      "\"That's right,\" Harry said evenly, still looking at his watch.\n\"I'm that overconfident.\"",
      "\"I wonder. It seems the Sorting Hat thinks you'll be the next\nDark Lord.\"",
      "\"And you know I'm trying pretty hard not to\nbe, and you saw that we already had a long discussion about whether\nyou were willing to teach me Occlumency, and in the end you decided\nto do it, so can we just get this over with?\"",
      "\"All right,\" said the man exactly six seconds later, same as\nlast time. \"Prepare yourself.\" He paused, and then said, his voice\nrather wistful, \"Though I do wish I could remember that\ntrick with the gold and silver.\"",
      "Harry was finding himself very disturbed by how reproducible\nhuman thoughts were when you reset people back to the same initial\nconditions and exposed them to the same stimuli. It was dispelling\nillusions that a good reductionist wasn't supposed to have in the\nfirst place.",
      "Harry was in a rather bad mood as he stomped out of his\nHerbology class the next Monday morning.",
      "Hermione was seething alongside him.",
      "The other children were still inside, a bit slow to assemble\ntheir things because they were gibbering excitedly to each other\nabout Ravenclaw winning the year's second Quidditch match.",
      "It seemed that last night after dinner, a girl had flown around\non a broomstick for thirty minutes and then caught some sort of\ngiant mosquito. There were other facts about what had happened\nduring this match, but they were irrelevant.",
      "Harry had missed this exciting sports event due to his\nOcclumency lesson, and also having a life.",
      "He had then avoided all conversations in the Ravenclaw dorm,\nweren't Quieting Charms and magical trunks wonderful. He had eaten\nbreakfast at the Gryffindor table.",
      "But Harry couldn't avoid Herbology, and the Ravenclaws had\ntalked about it before class, and after class, and during\nclass, until Harry had looked up from the baby furcot whose\ndiaper he was changing, and announced loudly that some of them were\ntrying to learn about plants and Snitches didn't grow on\nanything so could they all please shut up about Quidditch.\nEveryone else present had given him shocked looks, except Hermione,\nwho'd looked like she wanted to applaud, and Professor Sprout, who\nhad awarded him a point for Ravenclaw.",
      "A point for Ravenclaw.",
      "One point.",
      "The seven idiots on their idiot brooms playing their idiot game\nhad earned one hundred and ninety points for\nRavenclaw.",
      "It seemed that Quidditch scores added directly onto the\nHouse points total.",
      "In other words, catching a golden mosquito was worth 150 House\npoints.",
      "Harry couldn't even imagine what he would have to do to\nearn one hundred and fifty House points.",
      "Besides, y'know, rescuing a hundred and fifty\nHufflepuffs, or coming up with fifteen ideas as good as\nputting protective shells on time machines, or inventing\none thousand five hundred creative ways to kill people, or\nbeing Hermione Granger for the entire year.",
      "\"We should kill them,\" Harry said to Hermione, who was walking\nbeside him with an equally offended air.",
      "\"Who?\" said Hermione. \"The Quidditch team?\"",
      "\"I was thinking of everyone involved in any way with Quidditch\nanywhere, but the Ravenclaw team would be a start, yes.\"",
      "Hermione's lips were pursed disapprovingly. \"You do\nknow that killing people is wrong, Harry?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry said.",
      "\"Okay, just checking,\" Hermione said. \"Let's get the Seeker\nfirst. I've read some Agatha Christie mysteries, do you know how we\ncan get her onto a train?\"",
      "\"Two students plotting murder,\" said a dry voice. \"How\nshocking.\"",
      "From around a nearby corner strolled a man in lightly spotted\nrobes, his greasy hair falling long and unkempt about his\nshoulders. Deadly danger seemed to radiate out from him, filling\nthe hallway with improperly mixed potions and accidental falls and\npeople dying in bed of what the Aurors would rule to be natural\ncauses.",
      "Without thinking about it at all, Harry stepped in front of\nHermione.",
      "There was an intake of breath from behind him, and then a moment\nlater Hermione brushed past and stepped in front of him.\n\"Run, Harry!\" she said. \"Boys shouldn't have to be in danger.\"",
      "Severus Snape smiled mirthlessly. \"Amusing. I request a moment\nof your time, Potter, if you can tear yourself away from your\nflirtations with Miss Granger.\"",
      "Suddenly there was a very worried look on Hermione's face. She\nturned to Harry and opened her mouth, then paused, looking\ndistressed.",
      "\"Oh, don't worry, Miss Granger,\" said Severus's silky voice. \"I\npromise to return your beau unmaimed.\" His smile vanished. \"Now\nPotter and I are about to go off and have a private conversation,\njust by ourselves. I hope it is clear that you are not invited, but\njust in case, consider that an order from a Hogwarts professor. I'm\nsure a good little girl like you won't disobey.\"",
      "And Severus turned and walked back around the corner. \"Coming,\nPotter?\" his voice said.",
      "\"Um,\" Harry said to Hermione. \"Can I just sort of go off and\nfollow him and let you work out what I should say to make\nsure you're not all worried and offended?\"",
      "\"No,\" Hermione said, her voice trembling.",
      "Severus's laughter echoed from around the corner.",
      "Harry bowed his head. \"Sorry,\" he said lowly, \"really,\" and he\nwent off after the Potions Master.",
      "\"So,\" Harry said. There were no other sounds now but two pairs\nof legs, the long and the short, padding across a random stone\ncorridor. The Potions Master was striding quickly but not too fast\nfor Harry to keep up, and insofar as Harry could apply the concept\nof directionality to Hogwarts, they were moving away from the\nfrequented areas. \"What's this about?\"",
      "\"I don't suppose you could explain,\" Severus said dryly, \"why\nthe two of you were plotting to murder Cho Chang?\"",
      "\"I don't suppose you could explain,\" Harry said dryly,\n\"in your capacity as an official of the Hogwarts school system, why\ncatching a golden mosquito is deemed an academic accomplishment\nworthy of a hundred and fifty House points?\"",
      "A smile crossed Severus's lips. \"Dear me, and I thought you were\nsupposed to be perceptive. Are you truly so incapable of\nunderstanding your classmates, Potter, or do you dislike them too\nmuch to try? If Quidditch scores did not count toward the House Cup\nthen none of them would care about House points at all. It would\nmerely be an obscure contest for students like you and Miss\nGranger.\"",
      "It was a shockingly good answer.",
      "And that shock brought Harry's mind fully awake.",
      "In retrospect it shouldn't have been surprising that Severus\nunderstood his students, understood them very well indeed.",
      "He had been reading their minds.",
      "And...",
      "...the book said that a successful Legilimens was extremely\nrare, rarer than a perfect Occlumens, because almost no one had\nenough mental discipline.",
      "Mental discipline?",
      "Harry had collected stories about a man who routinely lost his\ntemper in class and blew up at young children.",
      "...but this same man, when Harry had spoken of the Dark Lord\nstill being alive, had responded instantly and perfectly - reacting\nin precisely the way that someone completely ignorant would\nreact.",
      "The man stalked about Hogwarts with the air of an assassin,\nradiating danger...",
      "...which was exactly not what a real assassin should\ndo. Real assassins should look like meek little accountants until\nthey killed you.",
      "He was the Head of House for proud and aristocratic Slytherin,\nand he wore a robe with spotted stains from bits of potions and\ningredients, which two minutes of magic could have removed.",
      "Harry noticed that he was confused.",
      "And his threat estimate of the Head of House Slytherin\nshot up astronomically.",
      "Dumbledore had seemed to think Severus was his, and there'd been\nnothing to contradict that; the Potions Master had been \"scary but\nnot abusive\", as promised. So, Harry had reasoned earlier, this was\nFellowship business. If Severus had been planning harm, surely he\nwouldn't have come to get Harry in front of Hermione, a witness,\nwhen he could have simply waited for some time when Harry was\nalone...",
      "Harry quietly bit his lip.",
      "\"I once knew a boy who truly adored Quidditch,\" said Severus\nSnape. \"He was an utter pillock. Just as you and I would expect, we\ntwo.\"",
      "\"What is this?\" Harry said slowly.",
      "\"Patience, Potter.\"",
      "Severus turned his head, and then glided with his assassin's\nbearing into a nearby opening in the corridor walls, a smaller and\nnarrower hallway leading off.",
      "Harry followed him, wondering if it would be smarter to simply\nrun away.",
      "They turned and made another turn, and came to a dead end, a\nsimple blank wall. If Hogwarts had actually been built, rather than\nconjured or summoned or birthed or whatever, Harry would have had\nsome sharp words for the architect about paying people to build\nhallways that didn't go anywhere.",
      "\"Quietus,\" said Severus, and a few other things as\nwell.",
      "Harry leaned back, folded his arms across his chest, and watched\nSeverus's face.",
      "\"Looking me in the eyes, Potter?\" said Severus Snape. \"Your\nOcclumency lessons cannot have progressed far enough for you to\nblock Legilimency. But then perhaps they have progressed far enough\nfor you to detect it. Since I cannot know otherwise, I will not\nrisk trying.\" The man smiled thinly. \"And the same will hold for\nDumbledore, I think. Which is why we are now having this\nlittle talk.\"",
      "Harry's eyes widened involuntarily.",
      "\"To begin with,\" Severus said, eyes glittering, \"I should like\nyou to promise not to speak of our conversations to\nanyone. So far as the school is concerned, we are\ndiscussing your Potions homework. Whether or not they believe that\nis unimportant. So far as Dumbledore and McGonagall are concerned,\nI am violating Draco Malfoy's confidences in me, and neither of us\nthink it proper to speak further of the particulars.\"",
      "Harry's brain tried to calculate the ramifications and\nimplications of this and ran out of swap space.",
      "\"Well?\" said the Potions Master.",
      "\"All right,\" Harry said slowly. It was hard to see how having a\nconversation and being unable to tell anyone could be more\nconstraining than not having it, in which case you\nalso couldn't tell anyone the contents. \"I promise.\"",
      "Severus was watching Harry intently. \"You said once in the\nHeadmaster's office that you would not tolerate bullying or abuse.\nAnd so I wonder, Harry Potter. Just how much do you resemble your\nfather?\"",
      "\"Unless we're talking about Michael Verres-Evans,\" Harry said,\n\"the answer is that I know very little about James Potter.\"",
      "Severus nodded, as though to himself. \"There is a fifth-year\nSlytherin. A boy named Lesath Lestrange. He is being bullied by\nGryffindors. I am... constrained, in my ability to deal with such\nsituations. You could help him, perhaps. If you wished. I\nam not asking you for a favor, and will not owe you one. It is\nsimply an opportunity to do as you will.\"",
      "Harry stared at Severus, thinking.",
      "\"Wondering if it's a trap?\" said Severus, a faint smile crossing\nhis lips. \"It is not. It is a test. Call it curiosity on\nmy part. But Lesath's troubles are real, as are my own difficulties\nin intervening.\"",
      "That was the trouble with other people knowing you were a good\nguy. Even if you knew they knew, you still couldn't ignore the\nbait.",
      "And if his father had protected students from bullies too... it\ndidn't matter if Harry knew why Severus had told him. It still made\nhim feel warm inside, and proud, and made it impossible to walk\naway.",
      "\"Fine,\" Harry said. \"Tell me about Lesath. Why is he being\nbullied?\"",
      "Severus's face lost the faint smile. \"You think there are\nreasons, Potter?\"",
      "\"Perhaps not,\" Harry said quietly. \"But the thought had occurred\nto me that he might have pushed some unimportant mudblood girl down\nthe stairs.\"",
      "\"Lesath Lestrange,\" Severus said, his voice now cold, \"is the\nson of Bellatrix Black, the most fanatic and evil servant of the\nDark Lord. Lesath is the acknowledged bastard of Rabastan\nLestrange. Shortly after the Dark Lord's death, Bellatrix and\nRabastan and Rabastan's brother Rodolphus were captured while\ntorturing Alice and Frank Longbottom. All three are in Azkaban for\nlife. The Longbottoms were driven insane by repeated Cruciatus and\nremain in St. Mungo's incurable ward. Is any of that a good reason\nto bully him, Potter?\"",
      "\"It is no reason at all,\" Harry said, still quietly. \"And Lesath\nhimself has done no wrong that you know?\"",
      "The faint smile crossed Severus's lips again. \"He is no more a\nsaint than anyone else. But he has pushed no mudblood girls down\nthe stairs, not that I ever heard.\"",
      "\"Or saw in his mind,\" said Harry.",
      "Severus's expression was chill. \"I did not invade his privacy,\nPotter. I looked within the Gryffindors, rather. He is simply a\nconvenient target for their little satisfactions.\"",
      "A cold wash of anger ran down Harry's spine, and he had to\nremind himself that Severus might not be a trustworthy source of\ninformation.",
      "\"And you think,\" Harry said, \"that an intervention by Harry\nPotter, the Boy-Who-Lived, might prove effective.\"",
      "\"Indeed,\" said Severus Snape, and told Harry when and where the\nGryffindors were planning their next little game.",
      "There is a main hallway running through the middle of Hogwarts's\nsecond floor on the north-south axis, and near the center of this\nhallway there is an opening into a short corridor which goes a\ndozen paces back before turning at a right angle, making an\nL-shape, and then goes a dozen paces more before it ends at a\nbright, wide window, looking out from three stories above upon the\nlight drizzle falling over the east grounds of Hogwarts. Standing\nby the window you can hear nothing of the main hallway, and no one\nin the hallway would hear what went on by the window. If you think\nthere is anything odd about this, you haven't been in Hogwarts very\nlong.",
      "Four boys in red-trimmed robes are laughing, and a boy in\ngreen-trimmed robes is screaming and grabbing frantically onto the\nedges of the opened window with his hands, as the four boys make as\nthough to push him out. It's just a joke, of course, and besides, a\nfall from that height wouldn't kill a wizard. All good fun. If you\nthink there is anything odd about this -",
      "\"What are you doing?\u202f\" says a sixth boy's voice.",
      "The four boys in red-trimmed robes spin around with sudden\nstarts, and the boy in green-trimmed robes frantically pushes\nhimself away from the window and falls to the floor, face streaked\nwith tears.",
      "\"Oh,\" says the most handsome of the boys in red-trimmed robes,\nsounding relieved, \"it's you. Hey, Lessy, you know who\nthis is?\"",
      "There isn't any answer from the boy on the floor, who's trying\nto get his sniffling under control, and the boy in the red-trimmed\nrobes draws back his leg for a kick -",
      "\"Stop it!\u202f\" shouts the sixth boy.",
      "The boy in the red-trimmed robes wobbles as he aborts the kick.\n\"Um,\" he says, \"do you know who this is?\"",
      "The sixth boy's breathing sounds strange. \"Lesath Lestrange,\" he\nsays, his breath coming in short pants, \"and he didn't do\nanything to my parents, he was five years old.\"",
      "Neville Longbottom stared at the four huge fifth-year bullies in\nfront of him, trying very hard to control his trembling.",
      "He should have just told Harry Potter no.",
      "\"Why are you defending him?\" said the handsome one,\nslowly, sounding puzzled with the first hints of offense. \"He's a\nSlytherin. And a Lestrange.\"",
      "\"He's a boy who lost his parents,\" said Neville Longbottom. \"I\nknow how that is.\" He didn't know where the words had come from. It\nsounded too cool, like something Harry Potter would say.",
      "The trembling went on, though.",
      "\"Who do you think you are?\u202f\" said the handsome\none, starting to sound angry.",
      "I am Neville, the last scion of the Noble and Most Ancient\nHouse of Longbottom -",
      "Neville couldn't say it.",
      "\"I think he's a traitor,\" said one of the other\nGryffindors, and there was a sudden sinking sensation in Neville's\nstomach.",
      "He'd known it, he'd just known it. Harry Potter had been wrong\nafter all. Bullies wouldn't stop only because Neville Longbottom\ntold them to stop.",
      "The handsome one took a step forward, and the three others\nfollowed.",
      "\"So that's how it is for you,\" Neville said, amazed at how\nsteady his voice was. \"It doesn't matter to you if it's Lesath\nLestrange or Neville Longbottom.\"",
      "Lesath Lestrange let out a sudden gasp, from where he was lying\non the floor.",
      "\"Evil is evil,\" snarled the same boy who'd spoken before, \"and\nif you're friends with evil, you're evil too.\"",
      "The four took another step forward.",
      "Lesath rose, wobbling, to his feet. His face was gray, and he\ntook a few steps forward, and leaned against the wall, and didn't\nsay anything. His eyes were fixed on the turn in the hallway, the\nway out.",
      "\"Friends,\" Neville said. Now his voice was going up a bit in\npitch. \"Yes, I have friends. One of them is the Boy-Who-Lived.\"",
      "A couple of the Gryffindors looked suddenly worried. The\nhandsome one didn't flinch. \"Harry Potter isn't here,\" he said, his\nvoice hard, \"and if he was, I don't think he'd like to see a\nLongbottom defending a Lestrange.\"",
      "And the Gryffindors took another long step forward, and behind\nthem, Lesath crept along the wall, waiting for his chance.",
      "Neville swallowed, and raised his right hand with his thumb and\nforefinger pressed together.",
      "He shut his eyes, because Harry Potter had made him promise not\nto peek.",
      "If this didn't work, he was never trusting anyone again.",
      "His voice came out surprisingly clear, considering.",
      "\"Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres. Harry James\nPotter-Evans-Verres. Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres. By the debt\nthat you owe me and the power of your true name I summon you, I\nopen the way for you, I call upon you to manifest yourself before\nme.\"",
      "Neville snapped his fingers.",
      "And then Neville opened his eyes.",
      "Lesath Lestrange was staring at him.",
      "The four Gryffindors were staring at him.",
      "The handsome one started to chuckle, and that set off the other\nthree.",
      "\"Was Harry Potter supposed to step around the corner or\nsomething?\" said the handsome one. \"Aw. Looks like you've been\nstood up.\"",
      "The handsome one took a menacing step forward toward\nNeville.",
      "The other three followed in lockstep.",
      "\"Ahem,\" said Harry Potter from behind them, leaning against the\nwall by the window, in the dead end of the hallway, where nobody\ncould possibly have gotten to without being seen.",
      "If watching people scream always felt this good, Neville could\nsort of understand why people became bullies.",
      "Harry Potter stalked forward, placing himself between Lesath\nLestrange and the others. He swept his icy gaze across the boys in\nred-trimmed robes, and then his eyes came to rest on the handsome\none, the ringleader. \"Mr. Carl Sloper,\" said Harry Potter. \"I\nbelieve I have comprehended this situation fully. If Lesath\nLestrange has ever committed a single evil himself, rather than\nbeing born to the wrong parents, the fact is not known to\nyou. If I am mistaken in this, Mr. Sloper, I suggest you\ninform me at once.\"",
      "Neville saw the fear and awe on the other boys' faces. He was\nfeeling it himself. Harry had claimed it would all be a\ntrick, but how could it be?",
      "\"But he's a Lestrange,\" said the ringleader.",
      "\"He's a boy who lost his parents,\" Harry Potter said,\nhis voice growing even colder.",
      "This time all three of the other Gryffindors flinched.",
      "\"So,\" said Harry Potter. \"You saw that Neville didn't want you\ntormenting an innocent boy on behalf of the Longbottoms. This\nfailed to move you. If I tell you that the Boy-Who-Lived\nalso thinks you are in the wrong, that what you did today\nwas a terrible mistake, does that make a difference?\"",
      "The ringleader took a step toward Harry.",
      "The others did not follow him.",
      "\"Carl,\" one of them said, swallowing. \"Maybe we should go.\"",
      "\"They say you're going to be the next Dark Lord,\" the ringleader\nsaid, staring at Harry.",
      "A grin crossed Harry Potter's face. \"They also say I'm secretly\nbetrothed to Ginevra Weasley and there's a prophecy about us\nconquering France.\" The smile faded. \"Since you're determined to\nforce the issue, Mr. Carl Sloper, let me make things clear.\nLeave Lesath alone. I will know if you don't.\"",
      "\"So Lessy snarked to you,\" said the ringleader coldly.",
      "\"Sure,\" said Harry Potter dryly, \"and he also told me what you\ndid today after you left Charms class, in a private secluded place\nwhere no one could see you, with a certain Hufflepuff girl wearing\na white ribbon in her hair -\"",
      "The ringleader's jaw dropped in shock.",
      "\"Eep,\" said one of the other Gryffindors in a high-pitched\nvoice, and spun on his heels and ran around the corner. His\nfootsteps rapidly pattered away and faded.",
      "And then there were six.",
      "\"Ah,\" said Harry Potter, \"there goes a slightly intelligent\nyoung man. The rest of you could stand to learn from Bertram\nKirke's example, before you get into, shall we say, trouble.\"",
      "\"Are you threatening to snark on us?\" said the handsome\nGryffindor, his voice trying to be angry, and rather wavering. \"Bad\nthings happen to snarkers.\"",
      "The other two Gryffindors started slowly moving back.",
      "Harry Potter started laughing. \"Oh, you did not just say that.\nAre you really trying to intimidate me? Me? Now\nhonestly, do you think you're scarier than Peregrine Derrick,\nSeverus Snape or for that matter You-Know-Who?\"",
      "Even the ringleader flinched at that.",
      "Harry Potter raised his hand, fingers poised, and all three of\nthe Gryffindors leaped backward, and one of them blurted \"Don't -\n!\"",
      "\"See,\" said Harry Potter, \"this is where I snap my fingers and\nyou become part of a hilariously amusing story that will be told\nwith much nervous laughter at dinner tonight. But the thing is,\npeople I trust keep telling me not to do that. Professor McGonagall\ntold me I was taking the easy way out of everything and Professor\nQuirrell says I need to learn how to lose. So you remember that\nstory where I let myself get beaten up by some older Slytherins? We\ncould do that. You could bully me for a while and I could let you.\nOnly you remember that part at the end where I tell my many, many\nfriends inside this school not to do anything about it? This time\nwe'll skip that part. So go ahead. Bully me.\"",
      "Harry Potter stepped forward, his arms opened wide in\ninvitation.",
      "The three Gryffindors broke and ran, and Neville had to sidestep\nquickly to avoid getting run over.",
      "There was silence, as their footsteps faded, and then more\nsilence after that.",
      "And then there were three.",
      "Harry Potter drew a deep breath, then exhaled. \"Whew,\" he said.\n\"How are you doing, Neville?\"",
      "Neville's voice came out in a high-pitched squeak. \"Okay,\nthat was really cool.\"",
      "A grin flashed across Harry Potter's face. \"You were\npretty cool too, you know.\"",
      "Neville knew that Harry Potter was just saying that, trying to\nmake him feel good, and it still started a warm glow inside his\nchest.",
      "Harry turned toward Lesath Lestrange -",
      "\"Are you okay, Lestrange?\" said Neville before Harry could open\nhis mouth.",
      "Now there was something you didn't expect to find yourself\nsaying, ever.",
      "Lesath Lestrange turned slowly, and stared at Neville, his face\ntight, no longer crying, tears glistening as they dried.",
      "\"You think you know how it is?\" said Lesath, his voice high and\nshaking. \"You think you know? My parents are in\nAzkaban, I try not to think about it and they always\nremind me, they think it's great that Mother is there in\nthe cold and the dark with the Dementors sucking away her life, I\nwish I was like Harry Potter, at least his parents aren't hurting,\nmy parents are always hurting, every second of every day, I wish I\nwas like you, at least you can see your parents sometimes, at least\nyou know they loved you, if Mother ever loved me the Dementors will\nhave eaten that thought by now -\"",
      "Neville's eyes were wide with shock. He hadn't expected\nthis.",
      "Lesath turned to Harry Potter, whose eyes were full of\nhorror.",
      "Lesath flung himself on the floor in front of Harry Potter,\ntouched his forehead to the ground, and whispered, \"Help me,\nLord.\"",
      "There was an awful silence. Neville couldn't think of a single\nthing to say, and from the naked shock on Harry's face, he couldn't\nthink of anything either.",
      "\"They say you can do anything, please, please my Lord, get my\nparents out of Azkaban, I'll be your loyal servant forever, my life\nwill be yours and my death as well, only please -\"",
      "\"Lesath,\" Harry said, his voice breaking, \"Lesath, I can't, I\ncan't really do things like that, it's all just stupid tricks.\"",
      "\"It's not!\u202f\" said Lesath, his voice high and desperate.\n\"I saw it, the stories are true, you can!\u202f\"",
      "Harry swallowed. \"Lesath, I set the whole thing up with Neville,\nwe planned it all out in advance, ask him!\"",
      "They had, though Harry hadn't said how he was going to\ndo any of it...",
      "When Lesath looked up from the floor his face was ghastly, and\nhis voice came out in a shriek that hurt Neville's ears. \"You\nson of a mudblood! You could get her out, you just won't! I got\ndown on my knees and begged you and you still won't help! I should\nhave known, you're the Boy-Who-Lived, you think she belongs\nthere!\u202f\"",
      "\"I can't!\u202f\" Harry said, his voice as desperate as\nLesath's. \"It's not a question of what I want, I don't have the\npower!\u202f\"",
      "Lesath rose to his feet, and spat on the floor in front of\nHarry, and then turned and walked away. When he was around the\ncorner the sound of his feet sped up, and as they faded Neville\nthought he heard a single sob.",
      "And then there were two.",
      "Neville looked at Harry.",
      "Harry looked at Neville.",
      "\"Wow,\" Neville said quietly. \"He didn't seem very grateful for\nbeing rescued.\"",
      "\"He thought I could help him,\" Harry said, his voice hoarse. \"He\nhad hope for the first time in years.\"",
      "Neville swallowed, and said it. \"I'm sorry.\"",
      "\"Wha?\" said Harry, sounding totally confused.",
      "\"I wasn't grateful when you helped me -\"",
      "\"Every single thing you said before was completely right,\" said\nthe Boy-Who-Lived.",
      "\"No,\" Neville said, \"it wasn't.\"",
      "They simultaneously gave brief sad smiles, each condescending to\nthe other.",
      "\"I know this wasn't real,\" said Neville, \"I know I couldn't have\ndone anything if you hadn't been here, but thanks for letting me\npretend.\"",
      "\"Give me a break,\" said Harry.",
      "Harry had turned from Neville, and was staring out the window at\nthe gloomy clouds.",
      "A completely ridiculous thought came to Neville. \"Are you\nfeeling guilty because you can't get Lesath's parents out of\nAzkaban?\"",
      "\"No,\" said Harry.",
      "A few seconds went by.",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harry.",
      "\"You're silly,\" said Neville.",
      "\"I am aware of this,\" said Harry.",
      "\"Do you have to do literally anything anyone asks\nyou?\"",
      "The Boy-Who-Lived turned back and looked at Neville again.\n\"Do? No. Feel guilty about not doing? Yes.\"",
      "Neville was having trouble finding words. \"Once the Dark Lord\ndied, Bellatrix Black was literally the most evil person in the\nentire world and that was before she went to Azkaban. She\ntortured my mother and father into insanity because she wanted to\nfind out what happened to the Dark Lord -\"",
      "\"I know,\" Harry said quietly. \"I get that, but -\"",
      "\"No! You don't! She had a reason for doing\nthat, and my parents were both Aurors! It's not even close\nto the worst thing she's ever done!\" Neville's voice was\nshaking.",
      "\"Even so,\" said the Boy-Who-Lived, his eyes distant as they\nstared off into somewhere else, some other place that Neville\ncouldn't imagine. \"There might be some incredibly clever solution\nthat makes it possible to save everyone and let them all live\nhappily ever after, and if only I was smart enough I would have\nthought of it by now -\"",
      "\"You have problems,\" said Neville. \"You think you ought to be\nwhat Lesath Lestrange thinks you are.\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" said the Boy-Who-Lived, \"that pretty much nails it.\nEvery time someone cries out in prayer and I can't answer, I feel\nguilty about not being God.\"",
      "Neville didn't quite understand that, but... \"That doesn't sound\ngood.\"",
      "Harry sighed. \"I understand that I have a problem, and I know\nwhat I need to do to solve it, all right? I'm working on it.\"",
      "Harry watched Neville leave.",
      "Of course Harry hadn't said what the solution was.",
      "The solution, obviously, was to hurry up and become God.",
      "Neville's footsteps moved off, and soon could no longer be\nheard.",
      "And then there was one.",
      "\"Ahem,\" said Severus Snape's voice from directly behind him.",
      "Harry let out a small scream and instantly hated himself.",
      "Slowly, Harry turned around.",
      "The tall greasy man in the spotted robes was leaning against the\nwall in the same position Harry had occupied.",
      "\"A fine invisibility cloak, Potter,\" drawled the Potions Master.\n\"Much is explained.\"",
      "Oh, bloody crap.",
      "\"And perhaps I have been in Dumbledore's company too long,\" said\nSeverus, \"but I cannot help but wonder if that is the\nCloak of Invisibility.\"",
      "Harry immediately turned into someone who'd never heard of the\nCloak of Invisibility and who was exactly as smart as\nHarry thought Severus thought Harry was.",
      "\"Oh, possibly,\" said Harry. \"I trust you realize the\nimplications, if it is?\"",
      "Severus's voice was condescending. \"You have no idea what I'm\ntalking about, do you, Potter? A rather clumsy try at fishing.\"",
      "(Professor Quirrell had remarked over their lunch that Harry\nreally needed to conceal his state of mind better than putting on a\nblank face when someone discussed a dangerous topic, and had\nexplained about one-level deceptions, two-level deceptions, and so\non. So either Severus was in fact modeling Harry as a\none-level player, which made Severus himself two-level, and Harry's\nthree-level move had been successful; or Severus was a four-level\nplayer and wanted Harry to think the deception had been\nsuccessful. Harry, smiling, had asked Professor Quirrell what level\nhe played at, and Professor Quirrell, also smiling, had\nresponded, One level higher than you.)",
      "\"So you were watching this whole time,\" said Harry.\n\"Disillusionment, I think it's called.\"",
      "A thin smile. \"It would have been foolish of me to take the\nslightest risk that you came to harm.\"",
      "\"And you wanted to see the results of your test firsthand,\" said\nHarry. \"So. Am I like my father?\"",
      "A strange sad expression came over the man, one that looked\nforeign to his face. \"I should sooner say, Harry Potter, that you\nresemble -\"",
      "Severus stopped short.",
      "He stared at Harry.",
      "\"Lestrange called you a son of a mudblood,\" Severus said slowly.\n\"It didn't seem to bother you much.\"",
      "Harry furrowed his eyebrows. \"Not under those circumstances,\nno.\"",
      "\"You'd just helped him,\" Severus said. His eyes were intent on\nHarry. \"And he threw it back in your face. Surely that isn't\nsomething you'd just forgive?\"",
      "\"He'd just been through a pretty harrowing experience,\" Harry\nsaid. \"And I don't think being rescued by first-years helped his\npride much, either.\"",
      "\"I suppose it was easy enough to forgive,\" Severus said, and his\nvoice was odd, \"since Lestrange means nothing to you. Just some\nstrange Slytherin. If it was a friend, perhaps, you would have felt\nfar more injured by what he said.\"",
      "\"If he were a friend,\" Harry said, \"all the more reason to\nforgive him.\"",
      "There was a long silence. Harry felt, and he couldn't have said\nwhy or from where, that the air was filling up with a dreadful\ntension, like water rising, and rising, and rising.",
      "Then Severus smiled, looking suddenly relaxed once more, and all\nthe tension vanished.",
      "\"You are a very forgiving person,\" Severus said, still smiling.\n\"I suppose your stepfather, Michael Verres-Evans, was the one who\ntaught it to you.\"",
      "\"More like Dad's science fiction and fantasy collection,\" said\nHarry. \"Sort of my fifth parent, really. I've lived the lives of\nall the characters in all my books, and all their mighty wisdom\nthunders in my head. Somewhere in there was someone like Lesath, I\nexpect, though I couldn't say who. It wasn't hard to put myself in\nhis shoes. And it was my books that told me what to do about it,\ntoo. The good guys forgive.\"",
      "Severus gave a light, amused laugh. \"I'm afraid I wouldn't know\nmuch about what good people do.\"",
      "Harry looked at him. That was kind of sad, actually. \"I'll lend\nyou some novels with good people in them, if you like.\"",
      "\"I should like to ask your advice about something,\" Severus\nsaid, his voice casual. \"I know of another fifth-year Slytherin who\nwas being bullied by Gryffindors. He was wooing a beautiful\nMuggleborn girl, who came across him being bullied, and tried to\nrescue him. And he called her a mudblood, and that was the end for\nthem. He apologized, many times, but she never forgave him. Have\nyou any thoughts for what he could have said or done, to win from\nher the forgiveness you gave Lestrange?\"",
      "\"Erm,\" Harry said, \"based on only that information, I'm not sure\nhe was the main one who had a problem. I'd have told him\nnot to date someone that incapable of forgiveness. Suppose they'd\ngotten married, can you imagine life in that household?\"",
      "There was a pause.",
      "\"Oh, but she could forgive,\" Severus said with\namusement in his voice. \"Why, afterward, she went off and became\nthe girlfriend of the bully. Tell me, why would she forgive the\nbully, and not the bullied?\"",
      "Harry shrugged. \"At a wild guess, because the bully had hurt\nsomeone else very badly, and the bullied had hurt\nher just a little, and to her that just felt far more\nunforgivable somehow. Or, not to put too fine a point on it, was\nthe bully handsome? Or for that matter, rich?\"",
      "There was another pause.",
      "\"Yes to both,\" said Severus.",
      "\"And there you have it,\" said Harry. \"Not that I've ever been\nthrough high school myself, but my books give me to understand that\nthere's a certain kind of teenage girl who'll be outraged by a\nsingle insult if the boy is plain or poor, yet who can somehow find\nroom in her heart to forgive a rich and handsome boy his bullying.\nShe was shallow, in other words. Tell whoever it was that she\nwasn't worthy of him and he needs to get over it and move on and\nnext time date girls who are deep instead of pretty.\"",
      "Severus stared at Harry in silence, his eyes glittering. The\nsmile had faded, and though Severus's face twitched, it did not\nreturn.",
      "Harry was starting to feel a bit nervous. \"Um, not that I've got\nany experience in the area myself, obviously, but I think that's\nwhat a wise adviser from my books would say.\"",
      "There was more silence and more glittering.",
      "It was probably a good time to change the subject.",
      "\"So,\" Harry said. \"Did I pass your test, whatever it was?\"",
      "\"I think,\" Severus said, \"that there should be no more\nconversations between us, Potter, and you would be exceedingly wise\nnever to speak of this one.\"",
      "Harry blinked. \"Would you mind telling me what I did wrong?\"",
      "\"You offended me,\" said Severus. \"And I no longer trust your\ncunning.\"",
      "Harry stared at Severus, taken rather aback.",
      "\"But you have given me well-meant advice,\" said Severus Snape,\n\"and so I will give you true advice in return.\" His voice was\nalmost perfectly steady. Like a string stretched almost perfectly\nhorizontal, despite the massive weight hanging from its middle, by\na million tons of tension pulling at either end. \"You almost died\ntoday, Potter. In the future, never share your wisdom with anyone\nunless you know exactly what you are both talking about.\"",
      "Harry's mind finally made the connection.",
      "\"You were that -\"",
      "Harry's mouth snapped shut as the almost died part sank\nin, two seconds too late.",
      "\"Yes,\" said Severus, \"I was.\"",
      "And the terrible tension flooded back into the room like water\npressurized at the bottom of the ocean.",
      "Harry couldn't breathe.",
      "Lose. Now.",
      "\"I didn't know,\" Harry whispered. \"I'm s-\"",
      "\"No,\" said Severus. Just that one word.",
      "Harry stood there in silence, his mind frantically searching for\noptions. Severus stood between him and the window, which was a real\npity, because a fall from that height wouldn't kill a wizard.",
      "\"Your books betrayed you, Potter,\" said Severus, still in that\nvoice stretched tight by a million tons of pull. \"They did not tell\nyou the one thing you needed to know. You cannot learn from stories\nwhat it is like to lose the one you love. That is something you\ncould never understand without feeling it yourself.\"",
      "\"My father,\" Harry whispered. It was his best guess, the one\nthing that might save him. \"My father tried to protect you from the\nbullies.\"",
      "A ghastly smile stretched across Severus's face, and the man\nmoved toward Harry.",
      "And past him.",
      "\"Goodbye, Potter,\" said Severus, not looking back on his way\nout. \"We shall have little to say to each other from today on.\"",
      "And at the corner, the man stopped, and without turning, spoke\none final time.",
      "\"Your father was the bully,\" said Severus Snape, \"and what your\nmother saw in him was something I never did understand until this\nday.\"",
      "He left.",
      "Harry turned and walked toward the window. His shaking hands\nwent onto the ledge.",
      "Never give anyone wise advice unless you know exactly what\nyou're both talking about. Got it.",
      "Harry stared out at the clouds and the light drizzle for a\nwhile. The window looked out on the east grounds, and it was\nafternoon, so if the sun was visible through the clouds at all,\nHarry couldn't see it.",
      "His hands had stopped shaking, but there was a tight feeling in\nHarry's chest, like it was being compressed by metal bands.",
      "So his father had been a bully.",
      "And his mother had been shallow.",
      "Maybe they'd grown up later. Good people like Professor\nMcGonagall did seem to think the world of them, and it might not be\nonly because they were heroic martyrs.",
      "Of course, that was scant consolation when you were eleven and\nabout to turn into a teenager, and wondering what sort of teenager\nyou might become.",
      "So very terrible.",
      "So very sad.",
      "Such an awful life Harry led.",
      "Learning that his genetic parents hadn't been perfect, why, he\nought to spend awhile moping about that, feeling sorry for\nhimself.",
      "Maybe he could complain to Lesath Lestrange.",
      "Harry had read about Dementors. Cold and darkness surrounded\nthem, and fear, they sucked away all your happy thoughts and in\nthat absence all your worst memories rose to the surface.",
      "He could imagine himself in Lesath's shoes, knowing that his\nparents were in Azkaban for life, that place from which no one had\never escaped.",
      "And Lesath would be imagining himself in his mother's place, in\nthe cold and the darkness and the fear, alone with all of her worst\nmemories, even in her dreams, every second of every day.",
      "For an instant Harry imagined his own Mum and Dad in Azkaban\nwith the Dementors sucking out their life, draining away the happy\nmemories of their love for him. Just for an instant, before his\nimagination blew a fuse and called an emergency shutdown and told\nhim never to imagine that again.",
      "Was it right to do that to anyone, even the second most evil\nperson in the world?",
      "No, said the wisdom of Harry's books, not if\nthere's any other way, any other way at all.",
      "And unless the wizarding justice system was as perfect as their\nprisons - and that sounded rather improbable, all things considered\n- somewhere in Azkaban was a person who was entirely innocent, and\nprobably more than one.",
      "There was a burning sensation in Harry's throat, and moisture\ngathering in his eyes, and he wanted to teleport all of Azkaban's\nprisoners to safety and call down fire from the sky and blast that\nterrible place down to bedrock. But he couldn't, because he wasn't\nGod.",
      "And Harry remembered what Professor Quirrell had said beneath\nthe starlight: Sometimes, when this flawed world seems\nunusually hateful, I wonder whether there might be some other\nplace, far away, where I should have been... But the stars are so\nvery, very far away... And I wonder what I would dream about, if I\nslept for a long, long time.",
      "Right now this flawed world seemed unusually hateful.",
      "And Harry couldn't understand Professor Quirrell's words, it\nmight have been an alien that had spoken, or an Artificial\nIntelligence, something built along such different lines from Harry\nthat his brain couldn't be forced to operate in that mode.",
      "You couldn't leave your home planet while it still contained a\nplace like Azkaban.",
      "You had to stay and fight."

      "Whatever can go Rowling will go Rowling.",
      "This should again go without saying, but views\nexpressed by Severus Snape are not necessarily those of the\nauthor.",
      "\"Okay,\" Harry said, swallowing. \"Okay, Hermione, it's enough,\nyou can stop.\"",
      "The white sugar pill in front of Hermione still hadn't changed\nshape or color at all, even though she was concentrating harder\nthan Harry had ever seen, her eyes squeezed shut, beads of sweat on\nher forehead, hand trembling as it gripped the wand -",
      "\"Hermione, stop! It's not going to work, Hermione, I\ndon't think we can make things that don't exist yet!\"",
      "Slowly, Hermione's hand relaxed its grasp on the wand.",
      "\"I thought I felt it,\" she said in a bare whisper. \"I thought I\nfelt it start to Transfigure, just for a second.\"",
      "There was a lump in Harry's throat. \"You were probably imagining\nit. Hoping too hard.\"",
      "\"I probably was,\" she said. She looked like she wanted to\ncry.",
      "Slowly, Harry took his mechanical pencil in his hand, and\nreached over to the sheet of paper with all the items crossed out,\nand drew a line through the item that said 'ALZHEIMER'S CURE'.",
      "They couldn't have fed anyone a Transfigured pill. But\nTransfiguration, at least the kind they could do, didn't enchant\nthe targets - it wouldn't Transfigure a regular broomstick into a\nflying one. So if Hermione had been able to make a pill at all, it\nwould have been a nonmagical pill, one that worked for\nordinary material reasons. They could have secretly made pills for\na Muggle science lab, let them study the pills and try to\nreverse-engineer them before the Transfiguration wore off... no one\nin either world would need to know that magic had been involved, it\nwould just be another scientific breakthrough...",
      "It hadn't been the sort of thing a wizard would think of,\neither. They didn't respect mere patterns of atoms that\nmuch, they didn't think of unenchanted material things as\nobjects of power. If it wasn't magical, it wasn't interesting.",
      "Earlier, Harry had very secretly - he hadn't even told\nHermione - tried to Transfigure nanotechnology a la Eric Drexler.\n(He'd tried to produce a desktop nanofactory, of course, not tiny\nself-replicating assemblers, Harry wasn't insane.) It would have\nbeen godhood in a single shot if it'd worked.",
      "\"That was it for today, right?\" said Hermione. She was slumped\nback in her chair, leaning her head against the back; and her face\nshowed her tiredness, which was very unusual for Hermione. She\nliked to pretend she was limitless, at least when Harry was\naround.",
      "\"One more,\" Harry said cautiously, \"but that one's small, plus\nit might actually work. I saved it for last because I was hoping we\ncould end on an up note. It's real stuff, not like phasers. They've\nalready made it in the laboratory, not like the Alzheimer's cure.\nAnd it's a generic substance, not specific like the lost books you\ntried to Transfigure copies of. I made a diagram of the molecular\nstructure to show you. We just want to make it longer than\nit's ever been made before, and with all the tubes aligned, and the\nendpoints embedded in diamond.\" Harry produced a sheet of graph\npaper.",
      "Hermione sat back up, took it, and studied it, frowning. \"These\nare all carbon atoms? And Harry, what's the name? I can't\nTransfigure it if I don't know what it's called.\"",
      "Harry made a disgusted face. He was still having trouble getting\nused to that sort of thing, it shouldn't matter what something was\nnamed if you knew what it was. \"They're called\nbuckytubes, or carbon nanotubes. It's a kind of fullerene that was\ndiscovered just this year. It's about a hundred times stronger than\nsteel and a sixth of the weight.\"",
      "Hermione looked up from the graph paper, her face surprised.\n\"That's real?\u202f\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" Harry said, \"just hard to make the Muggle way. If we\ncould get enough of the stuff, we could use it to build a space\nelevator all the way up to geosynchronous orbit or higher, and in\nterms of delta-v that's halfway to anywhere in the Solar System.\nPlus we could throw out solar power satellites like confetti.\"",
      "Hermione was frowning again. \"Is this stuff safe?\u202f\"",
      "\"I don't see why it wouldn't be,\" Harry said. \"A buckytube is\njust a graphite sheet wrapped into a circular tube, basically, and\ngraphite is the same stuff used in pencils -\"",
      "\"I know what graphite is, Harry,\" Hermione said. She\nbrushed her hair back absentmindedly, her eyebrows furrowed as she\nstared at the sheet of paper.",
      "Harry reached into a pocket of his robes, and produced a white\nthread tied to two small gray plastic rings at either end. He'd\nadded drops of superglue where the thread met either ring, to make\nit all a single object that could be Transfigured as a whole.\nCyanoacrylate, if Harry remembered correctly, worked by covalent\nbonds, and that was as close to being a \"solid object\" as you ever\ngot in a world ultimately composed of tiny individual atoms. \"When\nyou're ready,\" Harry said, \"try to Transfigure this into a set of\naligned buckytube fibers embedded in two solid diamond rings.\"",
      "\"All right...\" Hermione said slowly. \"Harry, I feel like I just\nmissed something.\"",
      "Harry shrugged helplessly. Maybe you're just tired. He\nknew better than to say it out loud, though.",
      "Hermione laid her wand against one plastic ring, and stared for\na while.",
      "Two small circles of glittering diamond lay on the table,\nconnected by a long black thread.",
      "\"It changed,\" said Hermione. She sounded like she was trying to\nbe enthusiastic but had run out of energy. \"Now what?\"",
      "Harry felt a bit deflated by his research partner's lack of\npassion, but did his best not to show it; maybe the same process\nwould work in reverse to cheer her up. \"Now I test it to see if it\nholds weight.\"",
      "There was an A-frame Harry had rigged up to do an earlier\nexperiment with diamond rods - you could make solid diamond objects\neasily, using Transfiguration, they just wouldn't last. The earlier\nexperiment had measured whether Transfiguring a long diamond rod\ninto a shorter diamond rod would allow it to lift a suspended heavy\nweight as it contracted, i.e., could you Transfigure against\ntension, which you in fact could.",
      "Harry carefully looped one circle of glittering diamond over the\nthick metal hook at the top of the rig, then attached a thick metal\nhanger to the bottom ring, and then started attaching weights to\nthe hanger.",
      "(Harry had asked the Weasley twins to Transfigure the apparatus\nfor him, and the Weasley twins had given him an incredulous look,\nlike they couldn't figure out what sort of prank he could\npossibly want that for, but they hadn't asked any\nquestions. And their Transfigurations, according to them, lasted\nfor around three hours, so Harry and Hermione still had a while\nleft.)",
      "\"One hundred kilograms,\" Harry said about a minute later. \"I\ndon't think a steel thread this thin would hold that. It should go\nup much higher, but that's all the weight I've got.\"",
      "There was a further silence.",
      "Harry straightened up, and went back to their table, and sat\ndown in his chair, and ceremoniously made a check mark next to\n'Buckytubes'. \"There,\" Harry said. \"That one worked.\"",
      "\"But it's not really useful, Harry, is it?\" Hermione\nsaid from where she was sitting with her head resting in her hands.\n\"I mean, even if we gave it to a scientist they couldn't learn how\nto make lots of buckytubes from studying ours.\"",
      "\"They might be able to learn something,\" Harry said.\n\"Hermione, look at it, that little tiny thread holding up\nall that weight, we just made something that no Muggle laboratory\ncould make -\"",
      "\"But any other witch could make it,\" Hermione said. Her\nexhaustion was coming into her voice, now. \"Harry, I don't think\nthis is working out.\"",
      "\"You mean our relationship?\" Harry said. \"Great! Let's break\nup.\"",
      "That got a slight grin out of her. \"I mean our research.\"",
      "\"Oh, Hermione, how could you?\"",
      "\"You're sweet when you're mean,\" she said. \"But Harry, this is\nnuts, I'm twelve, you're eleven, it's silly to think we're\ngoing to discover anything that no one's ever figured out\nbefore.\"",
      "\"Are you really saying we should give up on unraveling the\nsecrets of magic after trying for less than one month?\u202f\"\nHarry said, trying to put a note of challenge into his voice.\nHonestly he was feeling some of the same fatigue as Hermione. None\nof the good ideas ever worked. He'd made just one\ndiscovery worth mentioning, the Mendelian pattern, and he couldn't\ntell Hermione about it without breaking his promise to Draco.",
      "\"No,\" Hermione said. Her young face was looking very serious and\nadult. \"I'm saying right now we should be studying all the\nmagic that wizards already know, so we can do this sort of thing\nafter we graduate from Hogwarts.\"",
      "\"Um...\" Harry said. \"Hermione, I hate to put it this way, but\nimagine we'd decided to hold off on research until later, and the\nfirst thing we tried after we graduated was Transfiguring an\nAlzheimer's cure, and it worked. We'd feel... I don't\nthink the word stupid would adequately describe how we'd\nfeel. What if there's something else like that and it does\nwork?\"",
      "\"That's not fair, Harry!\" Hermione said. Her voice was\ntrembling like she was on the verge of breaking out crying. \"You\ncan't put that on people! It's not our job to do\nthat sort of thing, we're kids!\u202f\"",
      "For a moment Harry wondered what would happen if someone told\nHermione she had to fight an immortal Dark Lord, if she would turn\ninto one of the whiny self-pitying heroes that Harry could never\nstand reading about in his books.",
      "\"Anyway,\" Hermione said. Her voice shook. \"I don't want to keep\ndoing this. I don't believe children can do things that grownups\ncan't, that's only in stories.\"",
      "There was silence in the classroom.",
      "Hermione started to look a little scared, and Harry knew that\nhis own expression had gotten colder.",
      "It might not have hurt so much if the same thought hadn't\nalready come to Harry - that, while thirty might be old for a\nscientific revolutionary and twenty about right, while there were\npeople who got doctorates when they were seventeen and\nfourteen-year-old heirs who'd been great kings or generals, there\nwasn't really anyone who'd made the history books at eleven.",
      "\"All right,\" Harry said. \"Figure out how to do something a\ngrownup can't. Is that your challenge?\"",
      "\"I didn't mean it like that,\" Hermione said, her voice coming\nout in a frightened whisper.",
      "With an effort, Harry wrenched his gaze away from Hermione. \"I'm\nnot angry at you,\" Harry said. His voice was cold, despite\nhis best efforts. \"I'm angry at, I don't know, everything. But I'm\nnot willing to lose, Hermione. Losing isn't always the right thing\nto do. I'll figure out how to do something a grown wizard can't do,\nand then I'll get back to you. How's that?\"",
      "There was more silence.",
      "\"Okay,\" said Hermione, her voice wavering a little. She pushed\nherself up out of her chair, and went over to the door of the\nabandoned classroom they'd been working in. Her hand went onto the\ndoorknob. \"We're still friends, right? And if you can't figure out\nanything -\"",
      "Her voice halted.",
      "\"Then we'll study together,\" Harry said. His voice was even\ncolder now.",
      "\"Um, bye for now, then,\" Hermione said, and she quickly went out\nof the room and shut the door behind her.",
      "Sometimes Harry hated having a dark side, even when he was\ninside it.",
      "And the part of him that had thought exactly the same thing as\nHermione, that no, children couldn't do what grownups\ncouldn't, was saying all the things that Hermione had been too\nfrightened to say, like, That's one hell of a difficult\nchallenge you just grabbed for yourself and boy are you\ngoing to end up with egg on your face this time and at\nleast this way you'll know you've failed.",
      "And the part of him that didn't enjoy losing replied, in a very\ncold voice, Fine, you can shut up and watch.",
      "It was almost lunchtime, and Harry didn't care. He hadn't even\nbothered grabbing a snack bar from his pouch. His stomach could\nstand a little starving.",
      "The wizarding world was tiny, they didn't think like scientists,\nthey didn't know science, they didn't question what they'd grown up\nwith, they hadn't put protective shells on their time machines,\nthey played Quidditch, all of magical Britain was smaller than a\nsmall Muggle city, the greatest wizarding school only educated up\nto the age of seventeen, silly wasn't challenging that at\neleven, silly was assuming wizards knew what they\nwere doing and had already exhausted all the low-hanging fruit a\nscientific polymath would see.",
      "Step One had been to make a list of every magical constraint\nHarry could remember, all the things you supposedly couldn't\ndo.",
      "Step Two, mark the constraints that seemed to make the\nleast sense from a scientific perspective.",

      "Hermione still felt a little shaky as she sat down next to Mandy\nat the Ravenclaw table. Hermione's lunch had two fruits (tomato\nslices and peeled tangerines), three vegetables (carrots, carrots,\nand more carrots), one meat (fried Diricawl drumsticks whose\nunhealthy coating she would carefully remove), and one little piece\nof chocolate cake that she would earn by eating the other\nparts.",
      "It hadn't been as bad as Potions class, sometimes she still had\nnightmares about that. But this time she had made\nit happen and she'd felt like its target. Just for a\nmoment, before the terrible cold darkness looked away and said it\nwasn't angry with her, because it hadn't wanted to scare her.",
      "And she still had that feeling like she'd missed something\nearlier, something really important.",
      "But they hadn't violated any of the rules of Transfiguration...\nhad they? They hadn't made any liquids, any gases, they hadn't\ntaken orders from the Defense Professor...",
      "The pill! That had been something to be eaten!",
      "...well, no, nobody would just eat a pill lying around, it\nhadn't worked actually, they could have just Finite\nIncantatemed it if it had, but she would still have to tell\nHarry about that and make sure they didn't mention it in front of\nProfessor McGonagall, in case they were never allowed to study\nTransfiguration again...",
      "Hermione was starting to get a really sick feeling in her\nstomach. She pushed back her plate from the table, she couldn't eat\nlunch like this.",
      "And she closed her eyes and began to mentally recite the rules\nof Transfiguration.",
      "\"I will never Transfigure anything into liquid or\ngas.\"",
      "\"I will never Transfigure anything that looks like food or\nanything else that goes inside a human body.\"",
      "No, they really shouldn't have tried to Transfigure the\npill, or they should've at least realized... she'd been so\ncaught up in Harry's brilliant idea that she hadn't\nthought...",
      "The sick feeling in Hermione's stomach was getting worse. There\nwas a feeling in her mind of something hovering just on the edge of\nrecognition, a perception about to invert itself, a young woman\nabout to become a crone, a vase about to become two faces...",
      "And she went on remembering the rules of Transfiguration.",
      "Harry's knuckles had gone white on his wand by the time he\nstopped trying to Transfigure the air in front of his wand into a\npaperclip. It wouldn't have been safe to Transfigure the paperclip\ninto gas, of course, but Harry didn't see any reason why it would\nbe unsafe the other way around. It just wasn't supposed to be\npossible. But why not? Air was as real a substance as\nanything else...",
      "Well, maybe that limitation did make sense. Air was\ndisorganized, all the molecules constantly changing their relation\nto each other. Maybe you couldn't impose a new form on substance\nunless the substance was staying still long enough for you to\nmaster it, even though the atoms in solids were also constantly\nvibrating all the time...",

      "All right. Next on the list.",
      "You could only Transfigure whole objects as wholes. You couldn't\nTransfigure half a match into a needle, you had to\nTransfigure the whole thing. Back when Harry had been\ntrapped in that classroom by Draco, it had been the reason he\ncouldn't just Transfigure a thin cylindrical cross-section of the\nwalls into sponge, and punch out a chunk of stone large enough for\nhim to fit through the hole. He would have needed to impose a new\nform on the whole wall, and maybe a whole section of Hogwarts, just\nin order to change that little cross-section.",

      "The wizards couldn't transform parts of things, could only\ntransform what their minds perceived as wholes, because they didn't\nknow in their bones that it was all just atoms deep\ndown.",
      "Harry had focused on that knowledge as hard as he could, the\ntrue fact that the eraser was just a collection of atoms,\neverything was just collections of atoms, and the atoms of the\nlittle patch he was trying to Transfigure formed just as\nvalid a collection as any other collection he cared to think\nabout.",
      "And Harry still hadn't been able to change that single part of\nthe eraser, the Transfiguration wasn't going anywhere.",

All\nthe sensations of that bright world were really happening in that\nquiet cave of bone you called your skull, the place where\nyou lived and never, ever left. If you really wanted to\nsay hello to someone, to the actual person, you wouldn't\nshake their hand, you'd knock gently on their skull and say \"How\nare you doing in there?\" That was what people were, that was where\nthey really lived. And the picture of the park that you\nthought you were walking through was something that was\nvisualized inside your brain as it processed the signals sent down\nfrom your eyes and retina.",

      "The real eraser was far away, and Harry, inside his skull, could\nnever quite touch it, could only imagine ideas about it. But\nhis wand had the power, it could change things out there\nin reality, it was only Harry's own preconceptions that\nwere limiting it. Somewhere beyond the veil of Maya, the\ntruth behind Harry's concept of \"my wand\" was touching the\ncollection of atoms that Harry's mind thought of as \"a patch on the\neraser\", and if that wand could change the collection of atoms that\nHarry considered \"the whole eraser\", there was absolutely no reason\nwhy it couldn't change the other collection too...",

But that was\nall in the map, the true territory wasn't like that,\nreality itself had only a single level of\norganization, the quarks, it was a unified low-level process\nobeying mathematically simple rules.",
      "Or at least that was what Harry had believed before he'd found\nout about magic, but the eraser wasn't magical.",
      "And even if the eraser had been magical, the idea that\nthere could really exist a single solid eraser was\nimpossible. Things like erasers couldn't be basic\nelements of reality, they were too big and complicated to be atoms,\nthey had to be made of parts. You couldn't have\nthings that were fundamentally complicated. The implicit\nbelief that Harry's brain had in the eraser as a single object\nwasn't just wrong, it was a map-territory confusion, the\neraser only existed as a separate concept in Harry's multi-level\nmodel of the world, not as a separate element of\nsingle-level reality.",

No wonder, then, that his attempts\nto Transfigure based on that hadn't worked. If he wanted power, he\nhad to abandon his humanity, and force his thoughts to conform to\nthe true math of quantum mechanics.",
      "There were no particles, there were just clouds of\namplitude in a multiparticle configuration space and\nwhat his brain fondly imagined to be an eraser was nothing except a\ngigantic factor in a wavefunction that happened to\nfactorize, it didn't have a separate existence any more than\nthere was a particular solid factor of 3 hidden inside the number\n6, if his wand was capable of altering factors in an\napproximately factorizable wavefunction then it should damn\nwell be able to alter the slightly smaller factor that\nHarry's brain visualized as a patch of material on the eraser -",
      "Hermione tore through the hallways, shoes pounding hard on the\nstone, breath coming in pants, the shock of adrenaline still racing\nthrough her blood.",

Don't\nyou see what we were doing? We were experimenting with\nTransfiguration. We were experimenting with\nTransfiguration!\u202f\"",
      "There was another pause.",
      "\"Right...\" Harry said slowly. \"That's probably one of those\nthings they don't even bother telling you not to do\nbecause it's too obvious. Don't test brilliant new ideas for\nTransfiguration by yourselves in an unused classroom without\nconsulting any professors.\"",
      "\"You could have gotten us killed, Harry!\" Hermione knew it\nwasn't fair, she'd made the mistake too, but she still felt angry\nat him, he always sounded so confident and that had dragged her\nunthinkingly along in his wake. \"We could have spoiled\nProfessor McGonagall's perfect record!\u202f\"",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harry, \"let's not tell her about this, shall\nwe?\"",
      "\"We have to stop,\" Hermione said. \"We have to stop this or we're\ngoing to get hurt. We're too young, Harry, we can't do this, not\nyet.\"",
      "A weak grin crossed Harry's face. \"Um, you're sort of wrong\nabout that.\"",
      "And he held out a small pink rectangle, a rubber eraser with a\nbright metal patch on it.",
      "Hermione stared at it, puzzled.",
      "\"Quantum mechanics wasn't enough,\" Harry said. \"I had to go all\nthe way down to timeless physics before it took.

I Transfigured part of the eraser without\nchanging the whole thing.\"",
      "Hermione raised her wand again, pointed it at the eraser.",
      "For a moment anger crossed Harry's face, but he didn't make any\nmove to stop her.",
      "\"Finite Incantatem,\" said Hermione. \"Check with\nProfessor McGonagall before you try it again.\"",
      "Harry nodded, though his face was still a bit tight.",
      "\"And we still have to stop,\" said Hermione.",
      "\"Why?\u202f\" said Harry. \"Don't you see what this\nmeans, Hermione? Wizards don't know everything!\nThere's too few of them, even fewer who know any science, they\nhaven't exhausted the low-hanging fruit -\"",
      "\"It's not safe,\" Hermione said. \"If we can\nfind out new things it's even less safe! We're too\nyoung! We made one big mistake already, next time we could\njust die!\u202f\"",

      "\"So you want us to study,\" Harry said. She could tell he was\ntrying to keep the anger out of his voice. \"Just study.\"",
      "Hermione wasn't sure if she should say anything, but... \"Like\nyou studied, um, timeless physics, right?\"",
      "Harry looked back at her.",
      "\"That thing you did,\" Hermione said, her voice tentative, \"it\nwasn't because of our experiments, right? You could do it\nbecause you'd read lots of books.\"",
      "Harry opened his mouth, and then he shut it again. There was a\nfrustrated look on his face.",
      "\"All right,\" Harry said. \"How about this. We study, and if I\nthink of anything that seems really worth trying, we'll\ntry it after I ask a professor.\"",
      "\"Okay,\" Hermione said. She didn't fall over with relief, but\nonly because she was already sitting down.",
      "\"Shall we get lunch?\" Harry said cautiously.",
      "Hermione nodded. Yes. Lunch sounded good. For real, this\ntime.",
      "She carefully began to push herself off the stone floor, wincing\nas her body screamed at her -",

      "Hermione smiled back helplessly, although she thought she ought\nto still be angry.",
      "And she started walking back toward the Great Hall, feeling\nremarkably and wonderfully light on her feet, as Harry carefully\nkept his wand trained on her.",
      "He only managed to keep it up for five minutes, but it was the\nthought that counted.",
      "Minerva looked at Dumbledore.",
      "Dumbledore gazed back inquiringly at her. \"Did you understand\nany of that?\" the Headmaster said, sounding bemused.",
      "It had been the most complete and utter gibberish that Minerva\ncould ever remember hearing. She was feeling a bit embarrassed\nabout having summoned the Headmaster to hear it, but she'd been\ngiven explicit instructions.",
      "\"I'm afraid not,\" Professor McGonagall said primly.",
      "\"So,\" Dumbledore said. The silver beard swung away from her, the\nold wizard's twinkling gaze looked elsewhere once more. \"You\nsuspect you might be able to do something that other wizards can't\ndo, something we think is impossible.\"",
      "The three of them stood within the Headmaster's private\nTransfiguration workroom, where the shining phoenix of Dumbledore's\nPatronus had told her to bring Harry, moments after her own\nPatronus had reached him. Light shone down through the skylights\nand illuminated the great seven-pointed alchemical diagram drawn in\nthe center of the circular room, showing it to be a little dusty,\nwhich saddened Minerva. Transfiguration research was one of\nDumbledore's great enjoyments, and she'd known how pressed for time\nhe'd been lately, but not that he was this pressed.",
      "And now Harry Potter was going to waste even more of the\nHeadmaster's time. But she certainly couldn't blame Harry\nfor that. He'd done the proper thing in coming to her to say that\nhe'd had an idea for doing something in Transfiguration that was\ncurrently believed to be impossible, and she herself had done\nexactly what she'd been told to do: she'd ordered Harry to be quiet\nand not discuss anything with her until she had consulted the\nHeadmaster and they'd finished moving to a secure location.",
      "If Harry had started out by saying what specifically he\nthought he could do, she wouldn't have bothered.",
      "\"Look, I know it's hard to explain,\" Harry said, sounding a\nlittle embarrassed. \"What it adds up to is that what you believe\nconflicts with what scientists believe, in a case where I'd\ngenuinely expect scientists to know more than wizards.\"",
      "Minerva would have sighed out loud, if Dumbledore hadn't seemed\nto be taking the whole thing very seriously.",
      "Harry's idea stemmed from simple ignorance, nothing more. If you\nchanged half of a metal ball into glass, the whole ball\nhad a different Form. To change the part was to change the\nwhole, and that meant removing the whole Form and replacing it with\na different one. What would it even mean to Transfigure\nonly half of a metal ball? That the metal ball as a whole\nhad the same Form as before, but half that ball now had a\ndifferent Form?",
      "\"Mr. Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall, \"what you want to do\nisn't just impossible, it's illogical. If you change half\nof something, you did change the whole.\"",
      "\"Indeed,\" said Dumbledore. \"But Harry is the hero, so he may be\nable to do things that are logically impossible.\"",
      "Minerva would have rolled her eyes, if she hadn't gone numb a\nlong time ago.",
      "\"Supposing it was possible,\" said Dumbledore, \"can you\nthink of any reason why the results would differ in any way from\nordinary Transfiguration?\"",
      "Minerva frowned. The fact that the concept was literally\nunimaginable was presenting her with some difficulty, but she tried\nto take it at face value. A Transfiguration imposed on only half of\na metal ball...",
      "\"Strange things happening at the interface?\" said Minerva. \"But\nthat should be no different than Transfiguring the object as a\nwhole, into a Form with two different parts...\"",
      "Dumbledore nodded. \"That is my own thought as well. And Harry,\nif your theory is correct, it implies that what you want to do is\nexactly like any other Transfiguration, only applied to a\npart of the subject rather than the whole? No changes at\nall?\u202f\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry said firmly. \"That's the whole point.\"",
      "Dumbledore looked at her again. \"Minerva, can you think of any\nreason whatsoever why that would be dangerous?\"",
      "\"No,\" said Minerva, after she had finished searching through her\nmemory.",
      "\"Likewise myself,\" said the Headmaster. \"All right, then, since\nthis ought to be exactly analogous to ordinary Transfiguration in\nall respects, and since we cannot think of any reason whatsoever\nwhy it would be dangerous, I think that the second degree of\ncaution will suffice.\"",
      "Minerva was surprised, but she didn't object. Dumbledore was by\nfar her senior in Transfiguration, and he had tried literally\nthousands of new Transfigurations without ever choosing a degree of\ncaution that was too low. He had used Transfiguration in\ncombat and he was still alive. If the Headmaster\nthought the second degree was enough, it was enough.",
      "That Harry was certainly going to fail was, of course,\ncompletely irrelevant.",
      "The two of them started setting up the wards and detection webs.\nThe most important web was the one that checked to make sure no\nTransfigured material had entered the air. Harry would be enclosed\nin a separate shell of force with its own air supply just to be\ncertain, only his wand allowed to leave the shield, and the\ninterface tight. They were inside Hogwarts so they couldn't\nautomatically Apparate out any material that showed signs of\nspontaneous combustion, but they could launch it out a skylight\nalmost as fast, the windows all folded outward for exactly that\nreason. Harry himself would go out a different skylight at the\nfirst sign of trouble.",
      "Harry watched them working, his face looking a little\nfrightened.",
      "\"Don't worry,\" said Professor McGonagall in the middle of her\nrunning description, \"this almost certainly won't be necessary, Mr.\nPotter. If we expected anything to go wrong you would not\nbe allowed to try. It's just ordinary precautions for any\nTransfiguration no one has ever tried before.\"",
      "Harry swallowed and nodded.",
      "And a few minutes later, Harry was strapped into the safety\nchair and resting his wand against a metal ball - one that, based\non his current test scores, should have been too large for him to\nTransfigure in less than thirty minutes.",
      "And a few minutes after that, Minerva was leaning\nagainst the wall, feeling faint.",
      "There was a small patch of glass on the ball where Harry's wand\nhad rested.",
      "Harry didn't say I told you so, but the smug look on\nhis sweating face said it for him.",
      "Dumbledore was casting analytic Charms on the ball, looking more\nand more intrigued by the moment. Thirty years had melted off his\nface.",
      "\"Fascinating,\" said Dumbledore. \"It's exactly as he claimed. He\nsimply Transfigured a part of the subject without Transfiguring the\nwhole. You say it's really just a conceptual limitation,\nHarry?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry said, \"but a deep one, just knowing it had to be a\nconceptual limitation wasn't enough. I had to suppress the part of\nmy mind that was making the error and think instead about the\nunderlying reality that scientists figured out.\"",
      "\"Truly fascinating,\" Dumbledore said. \"I take it that for any\nother wizard to do the same would require months of study if they\ncould do it at all? And may I ask you to partially Transfigure some\nother subjects?\"",
      "\"Probably yes and of course,\" Harry said.",
      "Half an hour later, Minerva was feeling equally bewildered, but\nconsiderably reassured about the safety issues.",
      "It was the same, aside from being logically\nimpossible.",
      "\"I believe that's enough, Headmaster,\" Minerva said finally. \"I\nsuspect partial Transfiguration is more tiring than the ordinary\nsort.\"",
      "\"Getting less so with practice,\" said the exhausted and pale\nboy, voice unsteady, \"but yeah, you've got that right.\"",
      "The process of extracting Harry from the wards took another\nminute, and then Minerva escorted him to a much more comfortable\nchair, and Dumbledore produced an ice-cream soda.",
      "\"Congratulations, Mr. Potter!\" said Professor\nMcGonagall, and meant it. She would have bet almost anything\nagainst that working.",
      "\"Congratulations indeed,\" said Dumbledore. \"Even I did not make\nany original discoveries in Transfiguration before the age of\nfourteen. Not since the day of Dorotea Senjak has any genius\nflowered so early.\"",
      "\"Thanks,\" Harry said, sounding a little surprised.",
      "\"Nonetheless,\" Dumbledore said thoughtfully, \"I think it would\nbe most wise to keep this happy event a secret, at least for now.\nHarry, did you discuss your idea with any other person before you\nspoke to Professor McGonagall?\"",
      "There was silence.",
      "\"Um...\" Harry said. \"I don't want to turn anyone over to the\nInquisition, but I did tell one other student -\"",
      "The word almost exploded from Professor McGonagall's lips.\n\"What? You discussed a completely novel form of\nTransfiguration with a student before consulting a\nrecognized authority? Do you have any idea how\nirresponsible that was?\"",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" said Harry. \"I didn't realize.\"",
      "The boy looked appropriately frightened, and Minerva felt\nsomething inside her relax. At least Harry understood how foolish\nhe'd been.",
      "\"You must swear Miss Granger to secrecy,\" Dumbledore said\ngravely. \"And do not tell anyone else unless there is an extremely\ngood reason for it, and they too have sworn.\"",
      "\"Ah... why?\" Harry said.",
      "Minerva was wondering the same thing. Once again the Headmaster\nwas thinking too far ahead for her to keep up.",
      "\"Because you can do something that no one else will believe you\ncan do,\" Dumbledore said. \"Something completely unexpected. It may\nprove to be your critical advantage, Harry, and we must preserve\nit. Please, trust me in this.\"",
      "Professor McGonagall nodded, her firm face showing nothing of\nher inner confusion. \"Please do, Mr. Potter,\" she said.",
      "\"All right...\" Harry said slowly.",
      "\"Once we have finished examining your materials,\" Dumbledore\nadded, \"you may practice partial Transfiguration, on glass to steel\nand steel to glass only, with Miss Granger to act as your\nspotter. Naturally, if either of you suspect any symptom of any\nform of Transfiguration sickness, inform a professor at once.\"",
      "Just before Harry left the workroom, with his hand on the\ndoorhandle, the boy turned back and said, \"As long as we're here,\nhave either of you noticed anything different about Professor\nSnape?\"",
      "\"Different?\" said the Headmaster.",
      "Minerva didn't let her wry smile show on her face. Of course the\nboy was apprehensive about the 'evil Potions Master', since he had\nno way of knowing why Severus was to be trusted. It would have been\nodd to say the least, explaining to Harry that Severus was still in\nlove with his mother.",
      "\"I mean, has his behavior changed recently in any way?\" said\nHarry.",
      "\"Not that I have seen...\" the Headmaster said slowly. \"Why do\nyou ask?\"",
      "Harry shook his head. \"I don't want to prejudice your own\nobservations by saying. Just keep an eye out, maybe?\"",
      "That sent a quiver of unease through Minerva in a way that no\noutright accusation of Severus could have.",
      "Harry bowed to both of them respectfully, and took his\nleave.",
      "\"Albus,\" Minerva said after the boy had gone, \"how did you\nknow to take Harry seriously? I would have thought his\nidea merely impossible!\"",
      "The old wizard's face turned grave. \"The same reason it must be\nkept secret, Minerva. The same reason I told you to come to me, if\nHarry made any such claim. Because it is a power that Voldemort\nknows not.\"",
      "The words took a few seconds to sink in.",
      "And then the cold shiver went down her spine, as it always did\nwhen she remembered.",
      "It had started out as an ordinary job interview, Sybill\nTrelawney applying for the position of Professor of Divination.",
      "THE ONE WITH THE POWER TO VANQUISH THE DARK LORD\nAPPROACHES,\nBORN TO THOSE WHO HAVE THRICE DEFIED HIM,\nBORN AS THE SEVENTH MONTH DIES,\nAND THE DARK LORD WILL MARK HIM AS HIS EQUAL,\nBUT HE WILL HAVE POWER THE DARK LORD KNOWS NOT,\nAND EITHER MUST DESTROY ALL BUT A REMNANT OF THE OTHER,\nFOR THOSE TWO DIFFERENT SPIRITS CANNOT EXIST IN THE SAME\nWORLD.",
      "Those dreadful words, spoken in that terrible booming voice,\ndidn't seem to fit something like partial Transfiguration.",
      "\"Perhaps not, then,\" Dumbledore said after Minerva tried to\nexplain. \"I confess I had been hoping for something that would help\nin finding Voldemort's horcrux, wherever he may have hidden it.\nBut...\" The old wizard shrugged. \"Prophecies are tricky things,\nMinerva, and it is best to take no chances. The smallest thing may\nprove decisive if it remains unexpected.\"",
      "\"And what do you suppose he meant about Severus?\u202f\" said\nMinerva.",
      "\"There I have no idea,\" sighed Dumbledore. \"Unless Harry is\nmaking a move against Severus, and thought that an open question\nmight be taken seriously where a direct allegation would be\ndismissed. And if that was indeed what happened, Harry correctly\nreasoned that I would not trust that it was so. Let us simply keep\nwatch, without prejudice, as he asks.\"",
      "Aftermath, 1:",
      "\"Um, Hermione?\" Harry said in a very small voice. \"I think I owe\nyou a really, really, really big apology.\"",
      "Aftermath, 2:",
      "Alissa Cornfoot's eyes were slightly glazed as she gazed upon\nthe Potions Master giving her class a stern lecture, holding up a\ntiny bronze bean and saying something about screaming puddles of\nhuman flesh. Ever since the start of this year she'd been having\ntrouble listening in Potions. She kept staring at their awful,\nmean, greasy professor and fantasizing about special detentions.\nThere was probably something really wrong with her but she\njust couldn't seem to stop doing it -",
      "\"Ow!\" Alissa said then.",
      "Snape had just flicked the bronze bean unerringly at Alissa's\nforehead.",
      "\"Miss Cornfoot,\" said the Potions Master, his voice cutting,\n\"this is a delicate potion and if you cannot pay attention you will\nhurt your classmates, not just yourself. See me after class.\"",
      "The last four words didn't help her any, but she tried harder,\nand managed to get through the day without melting anyone.",
      "After class, Alissa approached the desk. Part of her wanted to\nstand there meekly with her face abashed and her hands clasped\npenitently behind her back, just in case, but some quiet instinct\ntold her this might be a bad idea. So instead she just\nstood there with her face neutral, in a posture that was very\nproper for a young lady, and said, \"Professor?\"",
      "\"Miss Cornfoot,\" Snape said without looking up from the sheets\nhe was grading, \"I do not return your affections, I begin to find\nyour stares disturbing, and you will restrain your eyes henceforth.\nIs that quite clear?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" said Alissa in a strangled squeak, and Snape dismissed\nher, and she fled the classroom with her cheeks flaming like molten\nlava."

      "Unfortunately, no one can be told who J. K. Rowling is. You have\nto see her for yourself.",
      "Science disclaimers: Luosha points out that the theory of\nempathy in Ch. 27 (you use your own brain to simulate others) isn't\nquite a known scientific fact. The evidence so far points in that\ndirection, but we haven't analyzed the brain circuitry and proven\nit. Similarly, timeless formulations of quantum mechanics (alluded\nto in Ch. 28) are so elegant that I'd be shocked to find the final\ntheory had time in it, but they're not established yet either.",
      "There'd been a sinking feeling in Hermione's stomach lately,\nevery time she heard the other students talking about her and\nHarry. She'd been in a shower stall this morning when she'd\noverheard a conversation between Morag and Padma that had been the\nlast straw piled on top of quite a lot of other straws.",
      "She was starting to think that getting involved in a rivalry\nwith Harry Potter had been a terrible mistake.",
      "If she'd just stayed away from Harry Potter, she could\nhave been Hermione Granger, the brightest academic star of\nHogwarts, who was earning more points for Ravenclaw than anyone.\nShe wouldn't have been as famous as the Boy-Who-Lived, but\nshe would have been famous for herself.",
      "Instead the Boy-Who-Lived had an academic rival, and her name\nhappened to be Hermione Granger.",
      "And worse, she had gone on a date with him.",
      "The idea of getting into a Romance with Harry had seemed like an\nappealing idea at first. She'd read books like that, and if there\nwas anyone in Hogwarts who was a candidate for the heroine's love\ninterest it was obviously Harry Potter. Bright, funny, famous,\nsometimes scary...",
      "So she'd forced Harry into going on a date with her.",
      "And now she was his love interest.",
      "Or worse, one of the options on his dinner menu.",
      "She'd been in a shower stall that morning and just about to turn\non the water, when she'd heard giggles coming from outside. And\nshe'd heard Morag talking about how that Muggleborn girl probably\nwouldn't fight hard enough to win against Ginevra Weasley, and\nPadma speculating that Harry Potter might decide he wanted\nboth.",
      "It was like they didn't understand that GIRLS had options on\ntheir dinner menu and BOYS fought over them.",
      "But that wasn't even the part that hurt, really. It was that\nwhen she scored 98 on one of Professor McGonagall's tests, the news\nwasn't that Hermione Granger had scored the highest in the class,\nthe news was that Harry Potter's rival had scored seven more points\nthan him.",
      "If you got too close to the Boy-Who-Lived, you became part of\nhis story.",
      "You didn't get your own.",
      "And the thought had come to Hermione that she should just walk\naway, but that would've been too sad.",
      "But she did want to get back what she'd accidentally\ngiven away by letting herself become known as Harry's rival. She\nwanted to be a separate person again instead of Harry Potter's\nthird leg, was that too much to ask?",
      "It was a hard trap to climb out of once you fell in. No matter\nhow high you scored in class, even if you did something that\ndeserved a special dinnertime announcement, it just meant you were\nrivaling Harry Potter again.",
      "But she thought she'd come up with a way.",
      "Something to do that wouldn't be seen as pushing up on\nthe opposite end of Harry Potter's seesaw.",
      "It would be hard.",
      "It would go against her nature.",
      "She would have to fight someone very evil.",
      "And she would need to ask someone even more evil for\nhelp.",
      "Hermione raised her hand to knock upon that terrible door.",
      "She hesitated.",
      "Hermione realized she was being silly, and raised her\nhand a bit higher.",
      "She tried to knock again.",
      "Her hand quite failed to touch the door.",
      "And then the door swung open anyway.",
      "\"Dear me,\" said the spider, sitting in its web. \"Was it really\nthat hard to lose a single Quirrell point, Miss Granger?\"",
      "Hermione stood there with her hand raised, her cheeks growing\npink. It had been.",
      "\"Well, Miss Granger, I shall be merciful,\" said the evil\nProfessor Quirrell. \"Consider it already lost. There, I have taken\na hard choice from you. Are you not grateful?\"",
      "\"Professor Quirrell,\" Hermione managed to say in a voice that\nsqueaked a little. \"I have a lot of Quirrell points, don't I?\"",
      "\"You do indeed,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"Though one less than\nyou had before. Terrible, isn't it? Just think, if I don't like\nyour reason for coming here, you could lose another fifty. Maybe\nI'd take them away one... by one... by one...\"",
      "Hermione's cheeks were going even redder. \"You're really evil,\ndid anyone ever tell you that?\"",
      "\"Miss Granger,\" Professor Quirrell said gravely, \"it can be\ndangerous to give people compliments like that when they have not\nbeen truly earned. The recipient might feel bashful and undeserving\nand want to do something worthy of your praise. Now what was it you\nwanted to talk to me about, Miss Granger?\"",
      "It was after lunch on Thursday afternoon, and Hermione and Harry\nwere ensconced in a little library nook, with a Quietus\nfield up so they could talk. Harry was lying stomach-down on the\nground with his elbows resting on the floor and his head in his\nhands and his feet kicking up casually behind him. Hermione was\noccupying a stuffed chair much too large for her, like she was the\nHermione center of a candy shell.",
      "Harry had suggested that they could, as a first pass, read just\nthe titles of all the books in the library, and then\nHermione could read all the tables of contents.",
      "Hermione had thought this was a brilliant idea. She'd never done\nthat with a library before.",
      "Unfortunately there was a slight flaw in this plan.",
      "Namely, they were both Ravenclaws.",
      "Hermione was reading a book called Magical\nMnemonics.",
      "Harry was reading a book called The Skeptical\nWizard.",
      "Each had thought it was just one special exception they would\nmake only this one time, and neither had yet realized it was\nimpossible for either of them to ever finish reading all the book\ntitles no matter how hard they tried.",
      "The quiet of their little nook was broken by two words.",
      "\"Oh, no,\" Harry suddenly said out loud, sounding like\nthe words had been torn out of him.",
      "There was a bit more quiet.",
      "\"He didn't,\" Harry said, in the same voice.",
      "Then she heard Harry start giggling helplessly.",
      "Hermione looked up from her book.",
      "\"All right,\" she said, \"what is it?\"",
      "\"I just found out why you never ask the Weasleys about the\nfamily rat,\" Harry said. \"It's really awful and I\nshouldn't be laughing and I'm a terrible person.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Hermione said primly, \"you are. Tell me too.\"",
      "\"Okay, first the background. There's a whole chapter in this\nbook about Sirius Black conspiracy theories. You remember who that\nis, right?\"",
      "\"Of course,\" said Hermione. Sirius Black was a traitor, a friend\nof James Potter who had let Voldemort into the protected home of\nthe Potters.",
      "\"So it turns out there were a number of, shall we say,\nirregularities, associated with Black going to Azkaban. He\ndidn't get a trial, and the Junior Minister in charge when the\nAurors arrested Black was none other than Cornelius Fudge, who\nbecame our current Minister of Magic.\"",
      "That sounded a little suspicious to Hermione too, and she said\nas much.",
      "Harry made a shrugging motion with his shoulders, as he lay on\nthe floor looking at his book. \"Suspicious things happen all the\ntime, and if you're a conspiracy theorist you can always find\nsomething.\"",
      "\"But no trial?\u202f\" said Hermione.",
      "\"It was right after the Dark Lord's defeat,\" Harry said, his\nvoice serious as he said it. \"Things were incredibly chaotic, and\nwhen the Aurors tracked down Black he was standing there laughing\nin a street ankle-deep in blood, with twenty eyewitnesses to\nrecount how he'd killed a friend of my father's named Peter\nPettigrew plus twelve bystanders. I'm not saying I approve of Black\nnot getting a trial. But these are wizards we're talking about\nhere, so it's not really any more suspicious than, I don't know,\nthe sort of thing people point to when they want to argue over who\nshot John F. Kennedy. So anyway, Sirius Black is the wizarding Lee\nHarvey Oswald. There's all sorts of conspiracy theories about who\nreally betrayed my parents instead of him, and one of the\nfavorites is Peter Pettigrew, and this is where it starts getting\ncomplicated.\"",
      "Hermione listened, fascinated. \"But how do you go from there to\nthe Weasleys' pet rat -\"",
      "\"Hold on,\" said Harry, \"I'm getting there. Now, after\nPettigrew's death it came out that he'd been a spy for the Light -\nnot a double agent, just someone who snuck around and found things\nout. He'd been good at that since he was a teenager, even in\nHogwarts he had a reputation for finding out all sorts of secrets.\nSo the conspiracy theory is that Pettigrew became an unregistered\nAnimagus while he was still in Hogwarts, an Animagus of something\nsmall that could scurry around and listen to conversations. The\nmain problem being that successful Animagi are rare and doing it as\na teenager would be really unlikely, so of course the conspiracy\ntheory says that my father and Black were unregistered Animagi too.\nAnd in that conspiracy theory, Pettigrew himself killed the twelve\nbystanders, turned into his small Animagus form, and ran. So\nMichael Shermer says there are four additional problems with this.\nOne, Black was the only one besides my parents who knew how to get\nthrough the wards around their house.\" (Harry's voice was a little\nhard as he said that.) \"Two, Black was a more likely suspect to\nstart with than Pettigrew, there's a rumor Black deliberately tried\nto get a student killed during his time at Hogwarts, and he was\nfrom this really nasty pureblood family, Bellatrix Black was\nliterally his cousin. Three, Black was twenty times the fighting\nwizard that Pettigrew was, even if he wasn't as smart. The duel\nbetween them would have been like Professor Quirrell versus\nProfessor Sprout. Pettigrew probably didn't even get a chance to\ndraw his wand, let alone fake all the evidence the conspiracy\ntheory requires. And four, Black was standing in the street\nlaughing.\"",
      "\"But the rat -\" said Hermione.",
      "\"Right,\" Harry said. \"Well, to make a long story short, Bill\nWeasley decided that his little brother Percy's pet rat was\nPettigrew's Animagus form -\"",
      "Hermione's jaw dropped.",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry said, \"you wouldn't exactly expect Evil Pettigrew\nto be living a sad and furtive life as the pet rat of an enemy\nwizarding family, he'd either be with the Malfoys or, more likely,\noff in the Carribean after a bit of plastic surgery. Anyway, Bill\nknocks out his little brother Percy, stuns and grabs the rat, sends\nout all these emergency owl messages -\"",
      "\"Oh, no!\u202f\" Hermione said, the words torn out of\nher.",
      "\"- and somehow manages to gather Dumbledore, the Minister of\nMagic, and the Head Auror -\"",
      "\"He didn't!\u202f\" said Hermione.",
      "\"And of course when they get there they think he's crazy, but\nthey use Veritas Oculum on the rat anyway, just to be\nsure, and what do they discover?\"",
      "She would've died. \"A rat.\"",
      "\"You win a cookie! So they dragged poor Bill Weasley off to St.\nMungo's and it turned out to be a pretty standard schizophrenic\nbreak, it just happens to some people, especially young men around\nwhat we'd consider college age. Guy was convinced he was\nninety-seven years old and had died and gone back in time to his\nyounger self via train station. And he responded perfectly well to\nantipsychotics and is back to normal and everything's fine now,\nexcept people don't talk as much anymore about Sirius Black\nconspiracy theories, and you don't ever ask the Weasleys about the\nfamily rat.\"",
      "Hermione was giggling helplessly. It was really awful and she\nshouldn't be laughing and she was a terrible person.",
      "\"The thing I don't understand,\" Harry said, after their\ngiggles had died down, \"is why Black would hunt down\nPettigrew instead of running as fast as he could. He had to know\nthe Aurors would be after him. I wonder if they got the reason out\nof Black before they took him to Azkaban? See, this is why people\nwho are absolutely positively guilty still go through the legal\nsystem and get trials.\"",
      "Hermione had to agree with that.",
      "Soon Harry was done with his book while Hermione was only\nhalfway through hers - hers was a much more difficult book than\nHarry's, but she still felt embarrassed about that. And then she\nhad to put Magical Mnemonics back on the shelf and drag\nherself away, because it was time for her to face the most dreaded\nclass in Hogwarts, BROOMSTICK RIDING.",
      "Harry tagged along as she walked there, even though his own\nclass wasn't until an hour and a half later, like a fighter jet\nescorting a sad little propeller plane on its way to its own\nfuneral.",
      "The boy wished her goodbye in a quiet, sympathetic voice, and\nshe walked onto the grassy fields of Doom.",
      "And there was much shrieking and almost falling and horrible\nbrushes with death and the ground in completely the wrong\nplace and the sun getting in her eyes and Morag buzzing her\nand Mandy thinking she was being subtle about always being\nnear enough to catch her if she fell and she knew the\nother students were laughing at both of them but she never said\nanything to Mandy because she didn't actually want to die.",
      "After ten million years the class ended, and she was back on the\nground where she belonged until next Thursday. Sometimes she had\nnightmares about it always being Thursday.",
      "Why everyone had to learn this, when they were just\ngoing to Apparate or Floo or portkey everywhere once they grew up,\nwas a complete and utter mystery to Hermione. Nobody actually\nneeded to ride broomsticks as an adult, it was like being forced to\nplay dodgeball in P.E.",
      "At least Harry had the decency to be ashamed of being good at\nit.",
      "It was a couple of hours later, and she was in a Hufflepuff\nstudy hall with Hannah, Susan, Leanne, and Megan. Professor\nFlitwick, surprisingly diffident for a teacher, had asked if she\nmight possibly maybe help those four with their Charms homework for\na while, even though they weren't Ravenclaws, and Hermione had felt\nso proud she'd almost burst.",
      "Hermione took a piece of parchment, spilled a little bit of ink\non it, tore it into four pieces, crumpled them, and tossed the\npieces on the table.",
      "She could have gotten it just from crumpling it, but\ndoing all that made it more like garbage, and that helped when\nsomeone was first practicing the Disposal Charm.",
      "Hermione sharpened her ears and eyes, and said, \"Okay, try\nit.\"",
      "\"Everto.\"",
      "\"Everto.\"",
      "\"Everto.\"",
      "\"Everto.\"",
      "Hermione didn't think she'd quite caught all the problems. \"Can\nyou all try it again?\"",
      "An hour later Hermione had concluded that (1), Leanne and Megan\nwere sort of sloppy, but if you asked them to keep practicing\nsomething, they would, (2) Hannah and Susan were focused and driven\nto the point where you had to keep telling them to slow\ndown and relax and think about things\ninstead of trying so hard - it was odd to think that those\ntwo would soon be hers - and (3) she liked helping\nHufflepuffs, the whole study hall had a very cheerful\natmosphere.",
      "When she left for dinner, she found the Boy-Who-Lived reading a\nbook while he waited to escort her. It made her feel flattered, and\nalso a little worried because Harry didn't seem to really talk to\nanyone besides her.",
      "\"Did you know there's a girl in Hufflepuff who's a\nMetamorphmagus?\" said Hermione as they headed toward the Great\nHall. \"She makes her hair really red, like stopsign red not Weasley\nred, and when she spilled hot tea on herself she turned into a\nblack-haired boy until she got it under control again.\"",
      "\"Really? Cool,\" said Harry, sounding a bit distracted. \"Um,\nHermione, just to check, you know tomorrow is the last day to sign\nup for Professor Quirrell's armies, right?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Hermione said. \"The armies of the evil Professor\nQuirrell.\" Her voice was a little angry, though Harry didn't know\nwhy, of course.",
      "\"Hermione,\" Harry said, his voice exasperated, \"he's not evil.\nHe's a little bit Dark and a whole lot Slytherin. It's not the same\nas being evil.\"",
      "Harry Potter had too many words for things, that was his\nproblem. He would have been better off if he'd just divided the\nuniverse into Good and Bad. \"Professor Quirrell called me up in\nfront of the whole class and told me to shoot\nsomeone!\u202f\"",
      "\"He was right,\" Harry said, his face sober. \"I'm sorry,\nHermione, but he was. You should have shot me, I wouldn't\nhave minded. You can't learn Battle Magic if you can't practice\nagainst real opponents using real spells. And now you're doing okay\nin sparring, aren't you?\"",
      "Hermione was only twelve, and so she knew, but she couldn't put\nit into words, she couldn't find the thing to say that would\nconvince Harry.",
      "Professor Quirrell had taken a young girl and called up that\ngirl in front of everyone, and ordered her to open fire without\nprovocation on a classmate.",
      "It didn't matter if Professor Quirrell was right about\nher needing to learn it.",
      "Professor McGonagall wouldn't ever have done that.",
      "Professor Flitwick wouldn't ever have done that.",
      "Maybe not even Professor Snape would have done that.",
      "Professor Quirrell was EVIL.",
      "But she couldn't find the words, and she knew that Harry would\nnever believe her.",
      "\"Hermione, I've talked to older students,\" Harry said.\n\"Professor Quirrell could be the only competent Defense\nProfessor we get in all seven years at Hogwarts. Anything else we\ncan learn later. If we want to study Defense, we have to do it\nthis year. The students who sign up for the\nextracurricular stuff are going to be learning huge amounts, way\nbeyond what the Ministry thinks first-years are supposed to study -\ndid you know we're going to be learning the Patronus Charm? In\nJanuary?\u202f\"",
      "\"The Patronus Charm?\u202f\" Hermione said, her voice going\nup in surprise.",
      "Her books said that was one of the brightest magics known, a\nweapon against the Darkest creatures, cast with pure positive\nemotions. It wasn't something she'd expect the evil Professor\nQuirrell to teach - or arrange to be taught, since Hermione\ncouldn't imagine he could do the spell himself.",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry said. \"Students don't usually learn the Patronus\nCharm until their fifth years or even later! But Professor Quirrell\nsays the Ministry schedules were made up by talking Flobberworms,\nand the ability to cast the Patronus Charm depends on emotions more\nthan magical strength. Professor Quirrell says that he thinks most\nstudents do way less than they can, and this year he's\ngoing to prove it.\"",
      "There was the usual tone of awed worship that Harry's voice had\nwhen he talked about Professor Quirrell, and Hermione gritted her\nteeth and kept walking.",
      "\"I already signed up, actually,\" Hermione said, her voice a\nlittle quiet. \"I did it this morning. For everything, just like you\nsaid.\"",
      "In for a penny, in for a pound was the usual\nexpression.",
      "Besides, she didn't want to lose, and if she wanted to\nwin she had to learn.",
      "\"So you will be in the armies, then?\" Harry's voice was\nsuddenly enthusiastic. \"That's awesome, Hermione! I've already\ngotten my list of soldiers, but I'm sure Professor Quirrell will\nlet me add one more, or trade -\"",
      "\"I'm not joining your army.\" Hermione's voice was\nsharp. She knew it was a reasonable assumption but it\nstill annoyed her.",
      "Harry blinked. \"Not Draco Malfoy's, surely. So you want to be in\nthe third army? Even though we don't know who the general\nis yet?\" Harry sounded surprised and a little wounded, and\nshe couldn't blame him, though of course she did blame him, since\nin fact it was all his fault. \"But why not mine?\"",
      "\"Think about it,\" Hermione snapped, \"and maybe you'll work it\nout!\"",
      "And she sped up her stride and left Harry gaping behind her.",
      "\"Professor Quirrell,\" Draco said in his most formal voice, \"I\nmust protest your appointment of Hermione Granger as the third\ngeneral.\"",
      "\"Oh?\" said Professor Quirrell, leaning back in his chair in a\ncasual and relaxed manner. \"Protest away, Mr. Malfoy.\"",
      "\"Granger is unfit for the position,\" said Draco.",
      "Professor Quirrell tapped a finger on his cheek thoughtfully.\n\"Why yes, yes she is. Do you have any further protests?\"",
      "\"Professor Quirrell,\" said Harry Potter beside him, \"with all\ndue respect to Miss Granger's many outstanding academic talents and\nthe Quirrell points she has justly earned in your classes, her\npersonality is not suited to military command.\"",
      "Draco had been relieved when Harry had agreed to accompany him\nto Professor Quirrell's office. It wasn't just that Harry\nwas a gigantic blatant teacher's pet where Professor Quirrell was\nconcerned. Draco had also started to worry that Harry actually\nwas friends with Granger, it had been a while now and he\nstill hadn't made his move... but this was more like\nit.",
      "\"I agree with Mr. Potter,\" said Draco. \"Appointing her as a\ngeneral turns it into a farce.\"",
      "\"Harshly put,\" said Harry, \"but I cannot bring myself to\ndisagree with Mr. Malfoy. To be blunt, Professor Quirrell, Hermione\nGranger has around as much intent to kill as a bowl of wet\ngrapes.\"",
      "\"That,\" said Professor Quirrell mildly, \"is not a thing I would\nfail to notice myself. You are telling me nothing I do not already\nknow.\"",
      "It was Draco's turn to say something, but the conversation had\nsuddenly hiccupped. That answer had not been in the\npossibilities he and Harry had brainstormed before coming here.\nWhat did you say after the teacher said that he knew\neverything you knew and he was still going to commit an obvious\nmistake?",
      "The silence stretched.",
      "\"Is this some sort of plot?\" Harry said slowly.",
      "\"Must everything I do be some sort of plot?\" said Professor\nQuirrell. \"Can't I ever create chaos just for the sake of\nchaos?\"",
      "Draco almost choked.",
      "\"Not in your Battle Magic class,\" Harry said with calm\ncertainty. \"Other places, maybe, but not there.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell slowly raised his eyebrows.",
      "Harry gazed steadily back at him.",
      "Draco shivered.",
      "\"Well then,\" Professor Quirrell said. \"Neither of you seem to\nhave considered a very simple question. Who could I appoint instead\nof Miss Granger?\"",
      "\"Blaise Zabini,\" Draco said without hesitation.",
      "\"Any other suggestions?\" said Professor Quirrell, sounding quite\namused.",
      "Anthony Goldstein and Ernie Macmillan, came the\nthought, before Draco's common sense kicked in and ruled out\nmudbloods and Hufflepuffs no matter how aggressively they dueled.\nSo instead Draco just said, \"What's wrong with Zabini?\"",
      "\"I see...\" Harry said slowly.",
      "\"I don't,\" said Draco. \"Why not Zabini?\"",
      "Professor Quirrell looked at Draco. \"Because, Mr. Malfoy, no\nmatter how hard he tries, he'll never be able to keep up with you\nor Mr. Potter.\"",
      "The shock of it staggered Draco. \"You can't believe\nGranger is going to -\"",
      "\"He's gambling on her,\" Harry said quietly. \"It's not\nguaranteed. The odds aren't even good. She'll probably never give\nus a good fight, and even if she does, it may take her months to\nlearn. But she's the only one in our year with any chance at all of\ngrowing to beat us.\"",
      "Draco's hands twitched but didn't clench into fists. Showing up\nas your supporter and then backing out was a classic undermining\ntactic, so Harry Potter was in it with Granger and\nthat implied -",
      "\"But Professor,\" Harry went on smoothly, \"I'm worried Hermione\nwill be miserable as the general of an army. I'm speaking\nas her friend now, Professor Quirrell. The competition might be\ngood for Draco and me, but what you're asking her to do isn't good\nfor her!\u202f\"",
      "Never mind.",
      "\"Your friendship for Hermione Granger does you credit,\"\nProfessor Quirrell said dryly. \"Especially as you are able to be\nfriends with Draco Malfoy at the same time. Quite a feat,\nthat.\"",
      "Harry suddenly looked a little nervous, meaning he probably felt\na lot more nervous, and Draco silently swore to himself.\nOf course Harry wasn't going to fool Professor Quirrell.",
      "\"And I doubt Miss Granger would appreciate your friendly\nconcern,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"She asked me for the position,\nMr. Potter, I did not ask her.\"",
      "Harry was quiet at this for a moment. Then he flashed Draco a\nquick look that mixed apology and warning, saying at the same time,\nSorry, I did my best and We'd better not press it any\nfurther.",
      "\"As for her being miserable,\" Professor Quirrell went on, a\nslight smile now playing about his lips, \"I suspect that she will\nhave a much easier time with the rigors of her position than either\nof you suspect, and that she will put up a good fight much sooner\nthan you think.\"",
      "Harry and Draco both gasped in horror.",
      "\"You're not going to advise her, are you?\" said Draco,\nutterly aghast.",
      "\"I never signed up to fight you!\u202f\" said Harry.",
      "The smile playing around Professor Quirrell's lips grew wider.\n\"As a matter of fact, I did offer to share a few\nsuggestions regarding Miss Granger's first battles.\"",
      "\"Professor Quirrell!\u202f\" said Harry.",
      "\"Oh, don't worry,\" Professor Quirrell said. \"She turned me down.\nJust as I expected.\"",
      "Draco's eyes narrowed.",
      "\"Dear me, Mr. Potter,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"didn't anyone\never tell you it's rude to stare?\"",
      "\"You're not going to secretly help her some other way,\nare you?\" said Harry.",
      "\"Would I do that?\" said Professor Quirrell.",
      "\"Yes,\" said Draco and Harry at the same time.",
      "\"I am wounded by your lack of trust. Well then, I promise not to\nhelp General Granger in any way that the two of you don't know\nabout. And now I suggest that both of you be about your military\naffairs. November approaches, and swiftly.\"",
      "Draco saw the implications before the door had closed all the\nway behind them on their way out of Professor Quirrell's\noffice.",
      "Harry had once spoken dismissively of \"people stuff\".",
      "And now that was Draco's only hope.",
      "Let him not realize, let him not realize...",
      "\"We should just attack the Granger girl first and get her out of\nour way,\" said Draco. \"After we crush her, we can have our own\ncontest without any distractions.\"",
      "\"Now that doesn't really seem fair to her, does it?\" said Harry\nin a mild voice.",
      "\"What do you care?\" said Draco. \"She's your rival,\nright?\" Then, with just the right note of suspicion in his voice,\n\"Don't tell me you've started really liking her, after\nbeing her rival all this time...\"",
      "\"Founders forbid,\" said Harry. \"What can I say, Draco? I merely\nhave a natural sense of justice. Granger does too, you know. She\nhas a very firm grasp on good and evil, and she's probably going to\nattack evil first. Having a name like 'Malfoy' is just asking for\nit, you know.\"",
      "DAMN IT!",
      "\"Harry,\" said Draco, sounding wounded and maybe a little\nsuperior, \"don't you want to fight fairly against me?\"",
      "\"You mean rather than attacking you after you've already lost\nsome of your forces beating Granger?\" said Harry. \"Oh, I don't\nknow. Maybe after I get bored with just winning I'll try that\n'fair' thing.\"",
      "\"Maybe she'll attack you,\" Draco said. \"You're\nher rival.\"",
      "\"But I'm her friendly rival,\" Harry said with an evil\ngrin. \"I bought her a nice birthday present and everything. You\nwouldn't go around sabotaging your friendly rival like that.\"",
      "\"What about sabotaging your friend's chance at a fair\nfight?\" said Draco angrily. \"I thought we were friends!\"",
      "\"Let me rephrase that,\" said Harry. \"Granger wouldn't\nsabotage a friendly rival. But that's because she has the killing\nintention of a bowl of wet grapes. You would. You\ntotally would. And guess what, so would I.\"",
      "DAMN IT!",
      "If it had been a play, there would have been dramatic music.",
      "The hero, impeccably turned out in green-trimmed robes and\nperfectly combed white-blonde hair, faced the villain.",
      "The villain, leaning back in a simple wooden chair with her\nbuckteeth clearly visible and stray chestnut curls drifting over\nher cheeks, faced the hero.",
      "It was Wednesday, October 30th, and the first battle was coming\nup on Sunday.",
      "Draco was standing in General Granger's office, a room the size\nof a small classroom. (Why each general's office was so\nlarge, Draco wasn't quite sure. A chair and a desk would have\nworked for him. He wasn't even clear on why the generals needed\noffices at all, his soldiers knew where to find him. Unless\nProfessor Quirrell had deliberately arranged the huge offices for\nthem as a sign of status, in which case Draco was all for it.)",
      "Granger sat on the room's single chair like a throne, all the\nway on the other end of the office from where the door opened.\nThere was a long oblong table stretched across the middle of the\nroom between them, and four small circular tables scattered around\nthe corners, but only that one single chair, all the way at the\nopposite end. The room had windows along one wall, and one beam of\nsunlight touched the top of Granger's hair like a glowing\ncrown.",
      "It would have been nice if Draco could have walked slowly\nforward. But there was a table in the way, and Draco had to go\naround it diagonally, and there was no good way to do that in a\ndramatic and dignified fashion. Had that been deliberate? If it had\nbeen his father, it surely would have been; but this was Granger,\nso surely not.",
      "There was nowhere for him to sit, and Granger hadn't stood up,\neither.",
      "Draco kept the outrage entirely off his face.",
      "\"Well, Mr. Draco Malfoy,\" Granger said once he stood before her,\n\"you requested an audience with me and I have been so gracious as\nto grant it. What was your plea?\"",
      "Come with me to visit Malfoy Manor, my father and I would\nlike to show you some interesting spells.",
      "\"Your rival, Potter, came to me with an offer,\" said Draco,\nputting a serious look on his face. \"He doesn't mind losing to me,\nbut would be humiliated if you won. So he wants to join with me and\nwipe you out immediately, not just in our first battle, all of\nthem. If I won't do that, Potter wants me to hold back or harass\nyou, while he launches an all-out attack on you as his first\nmove.\"",
      "\"I see,\" Granger said, looking surprised. \"And you're offering\nto help me against him?\"",
      "\"Of course,\" said Draco smoothly. \"I didn't think what he wanted\nto do to you was fair.\"",
      "\"Why, that's very nice of you, Mr. Malfoy,\" said Granger. \"I'm\nsorry for how I spoke to you earlier. We should be friends. Can I\ncall you Drakey?\"",
      "Alarm bells started to sound in Draco's head, but there was a\nchance she meant it...",
      "\"Of course,\" said Draco, \"if I can call you Hermy.\"",
      "Draco was pretty sure he saw her expression flicker.",
      "\"Anyway,\" Draco said, \"I was thinking it would serve Potter\nright if we both attacked him and wiped him out.\"",
      "\"But that wouldn't be fair to Mr. Potter, would it?\" said\nGranger.",
      "\"I think it'd be very fair,\" Draco said. \"He was planning to do\nit to you first.\"",
      "Granger was giving him a stern look that could possibly have\nintimidated him if he'd been a Hufflepuff instead of a Malfoy. \"You\nthink I'm pretty stupid, don't you, Mr. Malfoy?\"",
      "Draco smiled charmingly. \"No, Miss Granger, but I thought I'd at\nleast check. So, what do you want?\"",
      "\"Are you offering to bribe me?\" said Granger.",
      "\"Sure,\" said Draco. \"Can I just slip you a Galleon and have you\nbeat on Potter instead of me for the rest of the year?\"",
      "\"Nope,\" said Granger, \"but you can offer me ten Galleons and\nhave me attack both of you equally, instead of just you.\"",
      "\"Ten Galleons is a lot of money,\" Draco said cautiously.",
      "\"I didn't know the Malfoys were poor,\" said Granger.",
      "Draco stared at Granger.",
      "He was starting to get a strange feeling about this.",
      "That particular reply didn't seem like it should have come from\nthis particular girl.",
      "\"Well,\" said Draco, \"you don't get to be rich by wasting money,\nyou know.\"",
      "\"I don't know if you know what a dentist is, Mr. Malfoy, but my\nparents are dentists and anything less than ten Galleons\nisn't worth my time at all.\"",
      "\"Three Galleons,\" Draco said, more as a probe than anything\nelse.",
      "\"Nope,\" said Granger. \"If you want an equal fight at all, I\ndon't believe that a Malfoy wants an equal fight less than he wants\nten Galleons.\"",
      "Draco was starting to get a very strange feeling about\nthis.",
      "\"No,\" said Draco.",
      "\"No?\" said Granger. \"This is a limited time offer, Mr. Malfoy.\nAre you sure you want to risk a whole year of being miserably\ncrushed by the Boy-Who-Lived? That would be pretty embarrassing for\nthe House of Malfoy, wouldn't it?\"",
      "It was a very persuasive argument, one that was hard to refuse,\nbut you didn't get to be rich by spending money when your heart\ntold you it was a setup.",
      "\"No,\" said Draco.",
      "\"See you on Sunday,\" said Granger.",
      "Draco turned and walked out of the office without another\nword.",
      "That had been not right...",
      "\"Hermione,\" Harry said patiently, \"we're supposed to be\nplotting against each other. You could even betray me and it\nwouldn't mean anything outside the battlefield.\"",
      "Hermione shook her head. \"It wouldn't be nice, Harry.\"",
      "Harry sighed. \"I don't think you're getting into the spirit of\nthis at all.\"",
      "It wouldn't be nice. She'd actually said that. Hermione\ndidn't know whether to be insulted at what Harry thought of her, or\nworried about whether she really did sound like that much\nof a goody-two-shoes usually.",
      "It was probably time to change the subject.",
      "\"Anyway, are you doing anything special for tomorrow?\" said\nHermione. \"It's -\"",
      "Her voice cut off abruptly as she realized.",
      "\"Yes, Hermione,\" Harry said a little tightly, \"what day is\nit?\"",
      "Interlude:",
      "There was a time when October 31st had been called Halloween in\nmagical Britain.",
      "Now it was Harry Potter Day.",
      "Harry had turned down all the offers, even the one from Minister\nFudge which might have been good for future political favors and\nwhich he really should have gritted his teeth and taken.\nBut to Harry, October 31st would always be The Dark Lord Killed My\nParents Day. There should have been a quiet, dignified memorial\nservice somewhere, and if there was one, he hadn't been\ninvited.",
      "Hogwarts got the day off to celebrate. Even the Slytherins\ndidn't dare wear black outside their own dorm. There were special\nevents and special foods and the teachers looked the other way if\nanyone ran through the hallways. It was the tenth anniversary,\nafter all.",
      "Harry spent the day in his trunk so as not to spoil it for\nanyone else, eating snack bars in place of meals, reading some of\nhis sadder science fiction books (no fantasy), and writing a letter\nto Mum and Dad that was much longer than the ones he usually\nsent."

      "J. K. Rowling if a man tries to bother you, you can think blue,\ncount two, and look for a red shoe.",
      "The day was Sunday, November 3rd, and soon the three great\npowers of their school year, Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy, and\nHermione Granger, would begin their struggle for supreme\ndominance.",
      "(Harry was slightly annoyed by the way the Boy-Who-Lived had\nbeen demoted from supreme dominance to one of three equal rivals\njust by entering the contest, but he expected to get it back\nsoon.)",
      "The battleground was a section of non-Forbidden forest, dense\nwith trees, because Professor Quirrell thought that being able to\nsee all the enemy forces was too boring even for your very first\nbattle.",
      "All the students who were not actually in a first-year\narmy were camped out nearby and watching on screens that Professor\nQuirrell had set up. Except for three Gryffindors in their fourth\nyear, who were currently sick and confined to healer's beds by\nMadam Pomfrey. Aside from that, everyone was there.",
      "The students were dressed, not in their ordinary school robes,\nbut in Muggle camouflage uniforms that Professor Quirrell had\nobtained somewhere and supplied in sufficient quantity and variety\nto fit everyone. It wasn't that students would have worried about\nstains and rips, that was what Charms were for. But as Professor\nQuirrell had explained to the surprised wizardborns, nice dignified\nclothing was not efficient for hiding in forests or dodging around\ntrees.",
      "And on each uniform's breast, a patch bearing the name and\ninsignia of your army. A small patch. If you wanted your\nsoldiers to wear, say, colored ribbons so that they could identify\neach other at a distance, and risk the enemy getting their hands on\nthe ribbons, that was all up to you.",
      "Harry had tried to get the name Dragon Army.",
      "Draco had pitched a fit and said that would confuse everyone\ncompletely.",
      "Professor Quirrell had ruled that Draco could lay prior claim to\nthe name, if he wished.",
      "So now Harry was fighting Dragon Army.",
      "This probably wasn't a good sign.",
      "For their insignia, instead of the too-obvious dragon's head\nbreathing fire, Draco had elected to simply go with the fire.\nElegant, understated, deadly: This is what's left after we've\npassed. Very Malfoy.",
      "Harry, after considering alternate choices such as the 501st\nProvisional Battalion and Harry's Minions o' Doom, had decided that\nhis army would be known by the simple and dignified appellation of\nthe Chaos Legion.",
      "Their insignia was a hand poised with fingers ready to snap.",
      "It was universally agreed that this wasn't a good\nsign.",
      "Harry had earnestly advised Hermione that the young boys serving\nunder her were probably nervous about her being a girl with a\nreputation for being nice, and that she should pick something scary\nthat would reassure them of her toughness and make them proud to be\npart of her army, like the Blood Commandos or something.",
      "Hermione had named her army the Sunshine Regiment.",
      "Their insignia was a smiley face.",
      "And in ten minutes, they would be at war.",
      "Harry stood in the bright forest clearing that was their\nassigned starting location, an area of open space with old and\nrotting tree stumps that had been cleared away for some unknown\npurpose, ground coated with a small scattering of blown leaves and\nthe dried grey remnants of grass that had failed the test of\nsummer's heat, and the sun shining down brilliantly from above.",
      "Around him were the twenty-three soldiers that Professor\nQuirrell had assigned to him. Nearly all of Gryffindor had signed\nup, of course, and more than half of Slytherin, and less than half\nof Hufflepuff, and a handful of Ravenclaw. In Harry's army there\nwere twelve Gryffindors and six Slytherins and four Hufflepuffs and\none Ravenclaw besides himself... not that there was any way to tell\nthat by looking at the uniforms. No red, no green, no yellow, no\nblue. Just Muggle camouflage patterns, and a patch on the breast\nwith the device of a hand poised to snap its fingers.",
      "Harry looked upon his twenty-three soldiers, all wearing the\nsame uniforms with no marks of group identity save that single\npatch.",
      "And lo, Harry smiled, because he understood what this part of\nProfessor Quirrell's master plan was about; and Harry was taking\nfull advantage of it for his own purposes, too.",
      "There was a legendary episode in social psychology called the\nRobbers Cave experiment. It had been set up in the bewildered\naftermath of World War II, with the intent of investigating the\ncauses and remedies of conflicts between groups. The scientists had\nset up a summer camp for 22 boys from 22 different schools,\nselecting them to all be from stable middle-class families. The\nfirst phase of the experiment had been intended to investigate what\nit took to start a conflict between groups. The 22 boys\nhad been divided into two groups of 11 -",
      "- and this had been quite sufficient.",
      "The hostility had started from the moment the two groups had\nbecome aware of each others' existences in the state park, insults\nbeing hurled on the first meeting. They'd named themselves the\nEagles and the Rattlers (they hadn't needed names for themselves\nwhen they thought they were the only ones in the park) and had\nproceeded to develop contrasting group stereotypes, the Rattlers\nthinking of themselves as rough-and-tough and swearing heavily, the\nEagles correspondingly deciding to think of themselves as\nupright-and-proper.",
      "The other part of the experiment had been testing how to resolve\ngroup conflicts. Bringing the boys together to watch fireworks\nhadn't worked at all. They'd just shouted at each other and stayed\napart. What had worked was warning them that there might\nbe vandals in the park, and the two groups needing to work together\nto solve a failure of the park's water system. A common task, a\ncommon enemy.",
      "Harry had a strong suspicion Professor Quirrell had understood\nthis principle very well indeed when he had chosen to create\nthree armies per year.",
      "Three armies.",
      "Not four.",
      "And definitely not segregated by House... except that\nno Slytherins had been assigned to Draco besides Mr. Crabbe and Mr.\nGoyle.",
      "It was things like this which reassured Harry that Professor\nQuirrell, despite his affected Dark atmosphere and his pretense of\nneutrality in the conflict between Good and Evil, was secretly\nbacking Good, not that Harry would ever dare say that out loud.",
      "And Harry had decided to take full advantage of Professor\nQuirrell's plan to define a group identity his way.",
      "The Rattlers, once they'd met the Eagles, had started thinking\nof themselves as rough-and-tough, and they'd conducted themselves\naccordingly.",
      "The Eagles had thought of themselves as good-and-proper.",
      "And in that bright forest clearing, scattered around the old and\nrotting tree stumps, outlined in the sun shining down brilliantly\nfrom above, General Potter and his twenty-three soldiers were\narranged in nothing remotely resembling a formation. Some soldiers\nstood, some soldiers sat, some stood on one leg just to be\ndifferent.",
      "It was the Chaos Legion, after all.",
      "And if there wasn't a reason to stand in neat little\nlines, Harry had said disdainfully, there weren't going to be neat\nlittle lines.",
      "Harry had divided the army into 6 squads of 4 soldiers each,\neach squad commanded by a Squad Suggester. All troops were under\nstrict orders to disobey any orders they were given if it seemed\nlike a good idea at the time, including that one... unless Harry or\nthe Squad Suggester prefixed the order with \"Merlin says\", in which\ncase you were supposed to actually obey.",
      "The Chaos Legion's chief attack was to split up and run in from\nmultiple directions, randomly changing vectors and firing the\napproved sleep spell as rapidly as you could rebuild the magical\nstrength. And if you saw a chance to distract or confuse the enemy,\nyou took it.",
      "Fast. Creative. Unpredictable. Non-homogenous. Don't just obey\norders, think about whether what you're doing right now\nmakes sense.",
      "Harry wasn't quite as sure as he'd pretended that this was the\noptimum of military efficiency... but he'd been given a golden\nopportunity to change how some students thought about\nthemselves, and that was how he intended to use it.",
      "Five minutes to wartime, according to Harry's watch.",
      "General Potter walked (not marched) over to where his air force\nwas waiting tensely, broomsticks already clutched firmly in their\nhands.",
      "\"All wings report in,\" said General Potter. They'd rehearsed\nthis during their one training session on Saturday.",
      "\"Red Leader standing by,\" said Seamus Finnigan, who had no idea\nwhat it meant.",
      "\"Red Five standing by,\" said Dean Thomas, who'd waited his\nentire life to say it.",
      "\"Green Leader standing by,\" Theodore Nott said rather\nstiffly.",
      "\"Green Forty-One standing by,\" Tracey Davis said.",
      "\"I want you in the air the instant we hear the bell,\" said\nGeneral Potter. \"Do not engage, repeat, do not engage. Evade if\nunder fire.\" (Of course you did not aim sleep spells at\nbroomsticks; you fired a spell that gave a temporary red glow to\nwhatever it hit. If you hit the broomstick or the rider, they were\nout of the war.) \"Red Leader and Red Five, fly toward Malfoy's army\nas fast as you can, stay as high as you can while still seeing\nthem, return the instant you know for sure what they're doing.\nGreen Leader, do the same for Granger's army. Green Forty-One, fly\nabove us and watch for any approaching broomsticks or soldiers, you\nand only you are authorized to fire. And remember, I didn't say\n'Merlin says' for any of that, but we do really need the\ninformation. For Chaos!\"",
      "\"For Chaos!\" the four echoed with varying degrees of\nenthusiasm.",
      "Harry expected Hermione to launch an immediate attack on Draco,\nin which case he'd move his troops into position and start\nsupporting her, but only after she'd taken severe losses and caused\nsome damage. He would frame it as a heroic rescue, if possible; it\nwouldn't do to have Sunshine thinking that Chaos wasn't their\nfriend, after all.",
      "But just in case she didn't... well, that was why the\nChaos Legion was staying put until Green Leader reported back.",
      "Draco's moves would be in his own self-interest. He would\npredictably ready his army to defend against Hermione; he might or\nmight not realize that Harry had been lying about waiting to attack\nuntil after that battle finished. Harry had still put two\nbroomsticks on Dragon Army, just in case they were doing\nsomething, and just in case Draco or Mr. Goyle or Mr. Crabbe was\ngood enough to shoot a broomstick out of the sky.",
      "But General Granger was the unpredictable one, and Harry\ncouldn't move until he knew how she was moving.",
      "In the heart of the forest, with shadow patterns dancing on the\nground as leafy canopies swayed high above, General Malfoy stood\nwhere the trees were relatively sparser, and looked out on his\ntroops with calm satisfaction. Six units of three troops each, the\nAerial Unit of four (to which Gregory was assigned), and the\nCommand Unit, which was himself and Vincent. They'd only drilled\nfor a short time on the previous Saturday, but Draco was confident\nthat he'd managed to explain the basics. Stay with your mates,\nwatch their back and trust them to watch yours. Move as a single\nbody. Obey orders and show no fear. Aim, fire, move, aim again,\nfire again.",
      "The six units were formed up in a defensive perimeter around\nDraco, watchfully gazing outward into the forest. Back-to-back they\nstood, wands gripped low until they needed to strike.",
      "They already looked remarkably like the Auror units whose\ntraining Draco had watched during his father's inspections.",
      "Chaos and Sunshine weren't going to know what hit them.",
      "\"Attention,\" said General Malfoy.",
      "The six units unfolded and spun toward Draco; the faces of his\nbroomstick riders turned from where they stood with broomsticks\nalready in hand.",
      "Draco had decided to wait on demanding salutes until after they\nwon their first battle, when Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs would be\nmore willing to salute a Malfoy.",
      "But his soldiers were already standing straight enough,\nespecially the Gryffindors, that Draco wondered if he'd even needed\nto delay. Gregory had quietly listened, and reported back that\nDraco's volunteering to stand by Harry Potter in Defense class,\nthat time when Professor Quirrell had taught Harry how to lose, had\nmarked Draco as an acceptable commander. At least if you happened\nto be assigned to his army. Not all Slytherins are alike; there\nare Slytherins, and then there are Slytherins was what the\nGryffindors in Draco's army were quoting to their Housemates.",
      "Draco was frankly astounded at how incredibly\neasy that had been. Draco had protested at first about not\nbeing assigned any Slytherins, and Professor Quirrell had told him\nthat if he wanted to be the first Malfoy to gain complete political\ncontrol of the country, he needed to learn how to govern the other\nthree-quarters of the population. It was things like this which\nreassured Draco that Professor Quirrell had a great deal more\nsympathy for the good guys than Professor Quirrell was letting\non.",
      "The actual battle wouldn't be easy, especially if Granger did\nattack the Dragons first. Draco had agonized over whether to commit\nall his forces against Granger immediately in a preemptive strike,\nbut had worried that (1) Harry had been misleading him completely\nabout what Granger was likely to do, and (2) Harry had been\nmisleading him about waiting until after Granger's attack to join\nthe battle.",
      "Though Dragon Army had a secret weapon, three of them in fact,\nwhich might be enough to win even if they were attacked by both\narmies at once...",
      "It was almost time, and that meant it was time for the\npre-battle speech that Draco had composed and memorized.",
      "\"The battle is about to begin,\" Draco said. His voice was calm\nand precise. \"Remember everything that I and Mr. Crabbe and Mr.\nGoyle showed you. An army wins because it is disciplined and\ndeadly. General Potter and the Chaos Legion will not be\ndisciplined. Granger and the Sunshine Regiment will not be deadly.\nWe are disciplined, we are deadly, we are Dragons. The battle is\nabout to begin, and we are about to win it.\"",
      "(Ex tempore speech given by General Potter to the Chaos\nLegion, immediately before their first battle, on November 3rd,\n1991, at 2:56pm:)",
      "My troops, I'm not going to lie to you, our situation today is\nvery grim. Dragon Army has never lost a single battle. And Hermione\nGranger... has a very good memory. The truth is, most of you are\nprobably going to die. And the survivors will envy the dead. But we\nhave to win this. We have to win this so that someday, our children\ncan enjoy the taste of chocolate again. Everything is at stake\nhere. Literally everything. If we lose, the whole universe just\nblinks out like a light bulb. And now I realize that most of you\ndon't know what a light bulb is. Well, take it from me, it's bad.\nBut if we have to go down, let's go down fighting, like heroes, so\nthat as the darkness closes in, we can think to ourselves, at\nleast we had fun. Are you afraid to die? I know I am. I can\nfeel those cold shivers of fear like someone is pumping ice cream\ninto my shirt. But I know... that history is watching us. It was\nwatching us when we changed into our uniforms. It was probably\ntaking pictures. And history, my troops, is written by the victors.\nIf we win this, we can write our own history. A history in which\nHogwarts was founded by four renegade house elves. We can make\neveryone study that history, even though it isn't true, and if they\ndon't answer the right way on our tests... they'll fail the class.\nIsn't that worth dying for? No, don't answer that. Some things are\nbetter left unknown. None of us know why we're here. None of us\nknow why we're fighting. We just woke up in these uniforms in this\nmysterious forest, knowing only that there was no way to get our\nnames and memories back except victory. The students in those other\narmies out there... they're just like us. They don't want to die.\nThey're fighting to protect each other, the only friends they have\nleft. They're fighting because they know they have families who'll\nmiss them, even if they can't remember now. They may even be\nfighting to save the world. But we have a better reason to fight\nthan they do. We fight because we like it. We fight to amuse\neldritch monstrosities from beyond Space and Time. We fight because\nwe're Chaos. Soon the final battle will begin, so let me say now,\nbecause I won't get a chance later, that it was an honor to be your\ncommander, however briefly. Thank you, thank you all. And remember,\nyour goal isn't just to cut down the enemy, it's to make them\nafraid.",
      "A great booming gong echoed over the forest.",
      "And the Sunshine Regiment began to march.",
      "The tension rose and rose, as Harry and the nineteen other\nsoldiers who remained waited for the aerial warriors to report\nback. It shouldn't take long, broomsticks were fast and the\ndistances in the forest were not great -",
      "Two broomsticks approached, at speed, from the direction of\nDraco's camp, and all the soldiers tensed. They weren't executing\nthe maneuvers that were today's code for a friendly\nbroomstick.",
      "\"Scatter and fire!\u202f\" roared General Potter, and then\nsuited action to words, scurrying off at top speed toward the\nforest cover; and then as soon as Harry was among the trees, he\nspun back, raised his wand, tried to seek out the broomstick in the\nsky -",
      "\"Clear!\" shouted a voice. \"They're heading back!\"",
      "Harry gave a mental shrug. There'd been no way to prevent Draco\nfrom obtaining that information, and he'd only learn that they'd\nbeen standing still.",
      "And the Chaotics slowly emerged from the forest -",
      "\"Broomstick approaching from Granger's direction!\" yelled\nanother voice. \"I think it's Green Leader, he did the dip and\nroll!\"",
      "Moments later Theodore Nott dived out of the sky and pulled up\nin the midst of the soldiers.",
      "\"Granger has divided her forces in two!\" yelled Nott as he\nhovered on his broomstick. There was sweat staining his uniform,\nand all the reserve was gone from his voice. \"She's attacking both\narmies! Two brooms covering each force, they pursued me halfway\nhere!\"",
      "Divided her army, what on Earth -",
      "A large force concentrating fire on a small force could deplete\nthat force rapidly without taking much damage in return. If twenty\nsoldiers faced ten soldiers, twenty sleep spells would be aimed at\nthe ten soldiers with only ten sleep spells going the other way, so\nunless every one of those first sleep spells hit its target, the\nsmaller force would lose more people than they could manage to take\ndown with them. Defeated in detail was the military term\nfor what happened when you divided your forces like that. What\ncould Hermione possibly be thinking...",
      "Then Harry realized.",
      "She's being fair.",
      "It was going to be a long year in Defense class.",
      "\"All right,\" Harry said loudly, so the army could hear. \"We'll\nwait until the Red Wing reports in, and then we'll go cloud up some\nSunshine.\"",
      "Draco listened to the flyers' reports with his face calm, all\nhis shock concealed inside. What could Granger possibly be\nthinking?",
      "Then Draco realized.",
      "It's a feint.",
      "One of Sunshine's two forces would change direction, and both\nwould converge on... who?",
      "Neville Longbottom marched through the forest toward the\napproaching Sunny force, occasionally glancing up at the sky for\nbroomsticks. Beside him marched his squad comrades, Melvin Coote\nand Lavender Brown of Gryffindor, and Allen Flint of Slytherin.\nAllen Flint was their Squad Suggester, though Harry had first said\nto Neville, in private, that the position was his if he wanted\nit.",
      "Harry had said quite a lot of things to Neville in private,\nstarting with \"You know, Neville, if you want to become as awesome\nas the imaginary Neville who lives in your head but isn't allowed\nto do anything because you're scared, then you really should sign\nup for Professor Quirrell's armies.\"",
      "Neville was now sure the Boy-Who-Lived could read\nminds. There was just no other way Harry Potter could've known.\nNeville had never talked about that with anyone, or given\nany sign; and other people weren't like that, not that\nNeville had ever noticed.",
      "And Harry's promise had come true, this did feel\ndifferent from sparring in Defense class. Neville had hoped that\nsparring would fix everything that was wrong with him, and, well,\nit hadn't. Even if he could fire a few spells at another student in\nclass with Professor Quirrell watching to make sure nothing went\nwrong, even if he could dodge and fire back when it was\nallowed and everyone else was expecting it and\nthey would stare at him funny if he didn't do it, none of\nthat was the same as being able to stand up for himself.",
      "But being part of an army...",
      "Something strange was stirring inside Neville, as he marched\nthrough the forest alongside his comrades, upon their uniforms an\ninsignia of fingers poised to snap.",
      "He was allowed to walk if he wanted to, but he just felt like\nmarching.",
      "Beside him, Melvin and Lavender and Allen all seemed to feel\nlike marching too.",
      "And Neville softly began to sing the Song of Chaos.",
      "The tune was what a Muggle would have identified as John\nWilliams's Imperial March, also known as \"Darth Vader's Theme\"; and\nthe words Harry had added were easy to remember.",
      "Doom doom doom\nDoom doom doom doom doom doom\nDoom doom doom\nDoom doom doom doom doom doom\nDOOM doom DOOM\nDoom doom doom-doom-doom doom doom\nDoom doom-doom-doom doom doom\nDoom doom doom, doom doom doom.",
      "By the second line the others had joined in, and soon you could\nhear the same soft chant coming from nearby parts of the\nforest.",
      "And Neville marched alongside his fellow Chaos\nLegionnaires,\nstrange feelings stirring in his heart,\nimagination becoming reality,\nas from his lips poured a fearful song of doom.",
      "Harry stared at the bodies scattered across the forest.\nSomething inside him felt a bit queasy, and he had to remind\nhimself hard that they were only sleeping. There were girls among\nthe fallen, and that made it a lot worse somehow, and he would have\nto be careful never to mention that in front of Hermione or the\nAurors would find his remains stuffed into a small\nteapot.",
      "Half of Sunshine army hadn't put up much of a fight against all\nof Chaos. The nine ground soldiers had run in screaming\ninarticulately with Simple Shields raised, circular screens to\nprotect their faces and chests. But you couldn't fire and hold the\nshield at the same time, and Harry's soldiers had simply aimed for\nthe legs. All but one of the Sunnies had fallen over as soon as the\ncries of \"Somnium!\u202f\" filled the air. That last one had\ndropped her shield and managed to take out one of Harry's soldiers\nbefore being hit by the second wave of sleep spells (the Sleep Hex\nwas safe for multiple hits). The two Sunny broomsticks had been\nmuch harder to take down and had accounted for three Chaotics\nbefore being auraed by massed ground fire.",
      "Hermione wasn't among the fallen. Draco must have gotten her and\nthat was making Harry feel angry on some completely\nincomprehensible level, he wasn't sure if he was feeling protective\ntoward Hermione, or cheated that he hadn't been the one to do it,\nor maybe both.",
      "\"All right,\" Harry said, raising his voice. \"Let's everyone be\nclear on one thing, that wasn't a real fight. That was General\nGranger making a mistake in her first battle. Today's actual fight\nis with Dragon Army and it's not going to be anything like this.\nIt's going to be a lot more fun. Let's move out.\"",
      "A broomstick fell out of the sky, approaching terrifyingly fast,\nand spun on its end and decelerated so hard you could almost hear\nthe air screaming in protest, and came to a halt directly beside\nDraco.",
      "It wasn't dangerous showing-off. Gregory Goyle simply\nwas that good and he didn't waste time.",
      "\"Potter's coming,\" Gregory said with no trace of his usual fake\ndrawl. \"They've still got all four of their brooms, you want me to\ntake them out?\"",
      "\"No,\" Draco said sharply. \"Fighting over their army gives them\ntoo much of an advantage, they'll fire on you from the ground and\neven you might not be able to dodge it all. Wait until the forces\nengage.\"",
      "Draco had lost four Dragons in exchange for twelve Sunnies.\nApparently General Granger actually had been that\nincredibly stupid, though she hadn't been among the attackers, so\nDraco hadn't gotten a chance to taunt her or ask her what in\nMerlin's name she had been thinking.",
      "The true battle, they all knew, would be with Harry Potter.",
      "\"Prepare yourselves!\" roared Draco at his troops. \"Stay together\nwith your mates, act as a unit, fire as soon as the enemy is in\nrange!\"",
      "Discipline against Chaos.",
      "It shouldn't be much of a fight.",
      "The adrenaline was pumping and pumping into Neville's blood\nuntil he felt like he could hardly breathe.",
      "\"We're closing in,\" said General Potter in a voice barely loud\nenough to carry to the whole army. \"Time to spread out.\"",
      "Neville's comrades moved away from him. They would still support\neach other, but if you clustered together, the enemy would have a\nmuch easier time hitting you; fire aimed at one of your comrades\nmight miss and get you instead. You would be a lot harder to hit if\nyou spread out and moved as fast as you could.",
      "The first thing General Potter had done, during their training\nsession, was get them to fire on each other when both sides were\nrunning fast, or both stood still and took time to aim, or one was\nmoving and one was standing still - the reverse charm to the Sleep\nHex was simple, though you weren't allowed to use it during real\nbattles. General Potter had carefully recorded everything that\nhappened, done some figuring and ciphering, and then announced that\nit made more sense for them to focus, not on slowing down to aim\ncarefully, but on moving fast so they wouldn't get hit.",
      "It still bothered Neville a little not to be marching\nside-by-side with his comrades, but the scary battlecries they'd\nlearned were already thundering in his head and that made up for a\nlot.",
      "This time, Neville silently vowed to himself, his voice was\nabsolutely positively not going to squeak.",
      "\"Shields up,\" said General Potter, \"power to forward\ndeflectors.\"",
      "\"Contego,\" murmured the army, and the circular screens\nsprang into existence before their heads and chests.",
      "A sharp taste filled Neville's mouth. General Potter wouldn't\nhave ordered them to cast shields unless they were almost in range.\nNeville could see the uniformed shapes of Dragons moving through\nthe dense screens of trees, and the Dragons would be seeing them as\nwell -",
      "\"Attack!\u202f\" came a cry from the distance, the voice of\nDraco Malfoy, and General Potter bellowed, \"Charge -\"",
      "All the adrenaline in Neville's blood was unleashed, and his\nlegs took over, sending him flying faster than he'd ever run\nbefore, straight toward the enemy, knowing without needing to look\nthat all his comrades were doing the same.",
      "\"Blood for the blood god!\u202f\" screamed Neville.\n\"Skulls for the skull throne! Ia! Shub-Niggurath! The enemy's\ngate is sideways!\u202f\"",
      "There was a soundless impact as a sleep spell wasted itself\nagainst Neville's shield. If there'd been other spells fired, they\nhadn't hit.",
      "Neville saw the brief look of fear on Wayne Hopkins's face, as\nhe stood besides two Gryffindors Neville didn't recognize, and then\n-",
      "- Neville dropped the Simple Shield and fired at Wayne -",
      "- missed -",
      "- his racing legs went straight past the enemy grouping\nand toward another three Dragons, their wands coming up on him,\ntheir mouths opening -",
      "- not even thinking about it, Neville dived down to the forest\nfloor just as three voices cried \"Somnium!\u202f\"",
      "It hurt, hard stones and hard twigs digging into Neville as he\nrolled, it wasn't as bad as falling off his broomstick but he'd\nstill hit the ground pretty hard, and then Neville, with sudden\ninsight, lay still and closed his eyes.",
      "\"Stop that!\" screamed a voice. \"Don't shoot us, we're\nDragons!\"",
      "With a flash of glorious satisfaction, Neville realized that\nhe'd managed to get between two groups of Dragons just as one group\nhad fired on him. Harry had talked about this as a tactic for\nmaking the enemy afraid to fire, but apparently it worked a bit\nbetter than that.",
      "And not only that, the Dragons believed they'd gotten\nhim, since they'd seen Neville fall just as they fired.",
      "Neville counted to twenty inside his head, then opened his eyes\na crack.",
      "The three Dragons were very near him, heads spinning rapidly as\ncries of \"Somnium!\u202f\" and \"Skulls for the skull\nthrone!\u202f\" filled the air around them. All three had Simple\nShields up now.",
      "Neville's wand was still in his hand, and it didn't take much\neffort to point it at one boy's boots and whisper\n\"Somnium.\"",
      "Neville quickly closed his eyes and relaxed his hand as he heard\nthe boy fall to the ground.",
      "\"Where'd it come from?\u202f\" screamed Justin\nFinch-Fletchley's voice, and Neville heard rustles on the leafy\nforest floor, as of two Dragons spinning around looking for an\nenemy.",
      "\"Reform ranks!\u202f\" bellowed Malfoy's voice. \"To me,\neveryone, don't let them scatter you!\u202f\"",
      "Neville's ears heard the two Dragons actually jump over his\nprone body as they ran off.",
      "Neville opened his eyes, pushed himself to his feet a bit\npainfully, and then pointed his wand and said the new charm that\nGeneral Potter had taught them all. They couldn't do real illusion\nspells to confuse the enemy, but even at their age they could -",
      "\"Ventriliquo,\" whispered Neville, pointing the wand to\none side of Justin and the other boy, and then yelled, \"For\nCthulhu and glory!\u202f\"",
      "Justin and the other boy stopped abruptly, turning their shields\ntoward where Neville had moved his battlecry, and that was when\nmultiple cries of \"Somnium!\u202f\" filled the air and the other\nboy dropped before Neville was finished aiming.",
      "\"The last one's mine!\u202f\" yelled Neville, and then he\nstarted sprinting straight toward Justin, who'd been mean to him\nuntil the older Hufflepuffs straightened him out. Neville was\nsurrounded by his comrades and that meant -",
      "\"Special attack, Chaotic Leap!\u202f\" howled Neville as he\nran, and felt his body lighten, then lighten twice again, as his\ncomrades got their wands turned toward him and quietly cast the\nHover Charm, and Neville raised his left hand and snapped his\nfingers and then used his legs to push off the ground as hard as he\ncould and soared through the air. Sheer shock painted\nJustin's face as Neville went over the other boy's shield\nand pointed his wand down at the form passing beneath him and cried\n\"Somnium!\u202f\"",
      "Because he'd felt like it, that was why.",
      "Neville didn't quite get his feet turned around properly and\nrather plowed into the ground as he landed, but two out of three of\nthe other Chaos Legionnaires had managed to hold their wands on him\nthroughout and he didn't hit very hard.",
      "And Neville got to his feet, panting. He knew he should be\nmoving, people were yelling \"Somnium!\" all over the place -",
      "\"I am Neville, the last scion of Longbottom!\u202f\" screamed\nNeville to the sky above, holding his wand pointed straight up as\nthough to challenge the blazing blue heaven itself, knowing that\nnothing after this day would ever be the same again. \"Neville\nof Chaos! Face me if you da-\"",
      "(When Neville woke up afterward, he was told that Dragon Army\nhad taken this as their cue to counterattack.)",
      "The girl beside Harry slumped to the ground, taking the shot\nmeant for him, and he could hear Mr. Goyle's distant gloating laugh\nas his broomstick blasted past them, cutting the air so hard it\nshould have shattered in his wake.",
      "\"Luminos!\u202f\" cried one of the boys next to Harry, who\nhadn't been able to rebuild the magical strength fast enough to do\nit earlier, and Mr. Goyle dodged it without a pause.",
      "Chaos had only six soldiers left, now, and Dragon Army had two,\nand the only problem was that one of those soldiers was invincible,\nand the other one was using up three soldiers just to cover him\ninside his shield.",
      "They'd lost more soldiers to Mr. Goyle than all the other\nDragons put together, he was weaving and dodging through the air so\nfast that no one could hit him, and he could shoot people while\nhe did that.",
      "Harry had thought of all sorts of ways to stop Mr. Goyle but\nnone of them were safe, even using the Hover Charm to slow\nhim down (it was a continuous beam and much easier to aim) wouldn't\nbe safe because he might fall off the broomstick, throwing things\nin his way wouldn't be safe, and that was getting harder and harder\nto remember as Harry's blood froze over.",
      "It's a game. You're not trying to kill him. Don't\nthrow away all your future plans for a game...",
      "Harry could see the pattern, he could see how\nMr. Goyle was weaving, he could see how and when they all\nneeded to fire in order to create a web of shots that Mr. Goyle\nwouldn't be able to dodge, but he just hadn't been able to\nexplain it fast enough to his soldiers, they couldn't\ncoordinate their shots well enough, and now they didn't have enough\npeople left to do it -",
      "I refuse to lose, not like this, not my whole army to one\nsoldier!",
      "Mr. Goyle's broomstick turned faster than anything should have\nbeen able to turn and started to angle in toward Harry and his\nsurviving troops, he could sense the boy beside him tensing,\ngetting ready to throw himself in front of his general.",
      "SCREW THIS.",
      "Harry's wand came up, focusing on Mr. Goyle, Harry's mind\nvisualized the pattern, and Harry's lips opened and his voice\nscreamed -",
      "\"Luminosluminosluminosluminosluminosluminosluminosluminosluminosluminosluminosluminos-\"",
      "When Harry's eyes opened again, he found himself resting in a\ncomfortable position with his hands folded over his chest, holding\nhis wand like a fallen hero.",
      "Slowly, Harry sat up. His magic was aching, a strange\nsensation but not an entirely unpleasant one, much like the burn\nand lethargy that followed hard physical exercise.",
      "\"The general's awake!\" cried a voice, and Harry blinked and\nfocused in that direction.",
      "Four of his soldiers held their wands on a shimmering prismatic\nhemisphere, and Harry realized that the battle wasn't over.\nRight... he hadn't been hit by a Sleep Hex, just exhausted himself,\nso when he woke up, he was still in the game.",
      "Harry suspected he was going to get a lecture from\nsomeone-or-other about not exhausting his magic to the point of\nunconsciousness over a children's game. But he hadn't hurt Mr.\nGoyle when he'd lost his temper, and that was the important\nthing.",
      "Then Harry's mind clicked on another implication, and he looked\ndown at the steel ring on his left hand's pinky finger, and almost\nswore out loud when he saw that the tiny diamond was missing and\nthere was a marshmallow lying on the ground near where he'd\nfallen.",
      "He'd sustained that Transfiguration for seventeen days, and\nwould now need to start over.",
      "Could've been worse. He could've done this fourteen days later,\nafter Professor McGonagall had approved him to Transfigure\nhis father's rock. That was one very good lesson to learn the easy\nway.",
      "Note to self: Always remove ring from finger before\ncompletely exhausting magic.",
      "Harry pushed himself up, making rather hard going of it. Using\nup your magic didn't exhaust your muscles, but dodging around trees\ncertainly did.",
      "He staggered over to the iridescent hemisphere that contained\nDraco Malfoy, who was holding his wand aloft to sustain the shield,\nand smiling coldly at Harry.",
      "\"Where's the fifth soldier?\" said Harry.",
      "\"Um...\" said a boy whose name Harry couldn't remember at the\nmoment. \"I fired a Sleep Hex at the shield and it bounced off and\nhit Lavender, I mean the angle shouldn't have been right but it\ndid...\"",
      "Draco was smirking inside the shield.",
      "\"So let me guess,\" Harry said, looking Draco directly in the\neyes, \"those neat little trios are the formation used by\nprofessional magical militaries? Made up of trained soldiers who\ncan easily hit moving targets if their own hands are steady, and\nwho can combine their defensive powers so long as they stay\ntogether? Unlike your soldiers?\"",
      "The smirk had vanished from Draco's face, which was now hard and\ngrim.",
      "\"You know,\" Harry said lightly, knowing that none of the others\nwould understand the real message passing between them, \"it just\ngoes to show that you should always question everything you see\nyour role models doing, and ask why it's being done, and whether it\nmakes sense in context for you to do it too. Don't forget to apply\nthat advice to real life, by the way. And thanks for the\nslow-moving clustered targets.\"",
      "Because Draco had already gotten that lecture, and, Harry\nsuspected, discounted it out of suspicion that Harry was trying to\nshift his loyalties further away from pureblood tradition. Which of\ncourse Harry was. But this example would make an excellent\nexcuse, next Saturday, to claim that questioning authority was a\nmerely practical technique for real life. And Harry would also\nmention the experiments he'd run, first with individuals and then\nwith groups, to check that his ideas about the importance of speed\nhad actually been correct, by way of hammering home the\npoint of Draco needing to keep an eye out at all times for chances\nto apply the methods in everyday practice.",
      "\"You haven't won yet, General Potter!\" snarled Draco.\n\"Maybe we'll run out of time, and Professor Quirrell will call it a\ndraw.\"",
      "A fair and worrisome point. The war only ended when Professor\nQuirrell, in his personal judgment, decided one army had won by\npractical real-world standards. There was no formal\nvictory condition, Professor Quirrell had explained, because then\nHarry would figure out how to game the rules. Harry had to admit\nthis was a fair cop.",
      "And Harry couldn't blame Professor Quirrell for not calling an\nend, because it was plausible that the last soldier of Dragon Army\ncould take out all five survivors of the Chaos Legion.",
      "\"All right,\" Harry said. \"Does anyone know anything about\nGeneral Malfoy's shield spell?\"",
      "It developed that Draco's shield was a version of the standard\nProtego which had several disadvantages, the most\nimportant of which was that the shield couldn't move with the\ncaster.",
      "The upside - or from Harry's perspective, downside - was that it\nwas easier to learn, easier to cast, and much easier to sustain for\nlong times.",
      "They would need to hammer the shield with attack spells in order\nto bring it down.",
      "And Draco could apparently exert some control over the angle of\nreflection at which the spells would bounce off.",
      "The thought occurred to Harry that they could use Wingardium\nLeviosa to pile up heavy rocks on the shield until Draco couldn't\nsustain it against the pressure... but then the rocks might fall in\nafterward and hit Draco, and injuring the enemy general for real\nwas not among today's goals.",
      "\"So,\" said Harry. \"Are there such things as specialized\nshield-piercing spells?\"",
      "There were.",
      "Harry asked if any of his soldiers knew them.",
      "No one did.",
      "Draco was smirking again, inside his shield.",
      "Harry asked if there was any sort of attack spell that\nwouldn't bounce.",
      "Lightning bolts, it seemed, were usually absorbed by shields\ninstead of bouncing off them.",
      "...No one knew how to cast any sort of lightning-related\nspell.",
      "Draco sniggered.",
      "Harry sighed.",
      "He quite deliberately laid his wand on the ground.",
      "And Harry announced, with some weariness in his voice, that he\nwould just go ahead and take down the shield himself, using some\nmethod that would remain mysterious; and everyone else was to fire\non Draco as soon as his shield went down.",
      "The Chaos Legionnaires looked nervous.",
      "Draco looked calm, which was to say, controlled.",
      "A thin, folded blanket came out of Harry's pouch.",
      "Harry sat down next to the shimmering shield, and pulled the\nblanket over his head so no one could see what he did - except\nDraco, of course.",
      "From Harry's pouch came a car battery and a set of jumper\ncables.",
      "...it wasn't like he'd been about to leave the Muggle world to\nstart a new era of magical research, and not take along any way of\ngenerating electricity.",
      "Shortly after, the Chaos Legionnaires heard the sound of fingers\nsnapping, followed by a crackling noise from beneath the blanket.\nThe shield started glowing more brightly, and Harry's voice said,\n\"Don't be distracted please, eyes on General Malfoy.\"",
      "The strain was showing on Draco's face, along with the fury and\nannoyance and frustration.",
      "Harry smiled up at him, and mouthed, Tell you\nlater.",
      "And that was when a spiral of green energy shot out of the\nforest and smashed into Draco's shield, which shrieked like pieces\nof sharp glass being rubbed together, and Draco staggered.",
      "In sudden, frantic panic, Harry took the jumper cables off the\nbattery and fed them into the pouch, then he fed the battery itself\ninto the pouch, and then he tore off the blanket and grabbed his\nwand and stood up.",
      "All of his soldiers were still there and glancing around\nfrantically.",
      "\"Contego,\" Harry said, and his soldiers followed suit,\nbut Harry didn't even know which direction the shield ought to be\npointing in. \"Did anyone see where that came from?\" Shaken heads.\n\"And General Malfoy, would you mind telling me if you got\nGeneral Granger?\"",
      "\"Why yes,\" Draco said acidly, \"I mind.\"",
      "Oh, hell.",
      "Harry's mind began calculating, Draco inside the shield, Draco\nworn out now to some degree, Harry worn out too, Hermione in the\nwoods who-knew-where, Harry and four other Chaotics left...",
      "\"You know, General Granger,\" Harry said out loud, \"you really\nshould've waited to attack until after I'd fought General Malfoy.\nYou might've been able to get all the survivors.\"",
      "From somewhere came a girl's high-pitched laughter.",
      "Harry froze.",
      "That wasn't Hermione.",
      "And that was when the dreadful, eerie, cheerful chant began to\nrise, coming from all around them.",
      "\"Don't be frightened, don't be sad,\nWe'll only hurt you if you're bad...\"",
      "\"Granger cheated!\u202f\" burst out Draco inside the shield.\n\"She woke up her soldiers! Why doesn't Professor Quirrell -\"",
      "\"Let me guess,\" Harry said, the sickness already churning in his\nstomach. He really hated losing. \"It was a very easy battle, right?\nThey dropped like flies?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Draco said. \"We got them all on the first shot -\"",
      "The look of horrified realization spread from Draco to the Chaos\nLegionnaires.",
      "\"No,\" Harry said, \"we didn't.\"",
      "Camouflaged forms were appearing from among the trees.",
      "\"Allies?\" Harry said.",
      "\"Allies,\" Draco said.",
      "\"Good,\" said General Granger's voice, and a spiral of green\nenergy blazed out of the woods and shattered Draco's shield to\nsplinters.",
      "General Granger surveyed the battlefield with a definite feeling\nof satisfaction. She was down to nine Sunshine Soldiers, but that\nwas probably enough to handle the last survivor of the enemy\nforces, especially when Parvati and Anthony and Ernie were already\nholding their wands on General Potter, whom she'd ordered taken\nalive (well, conscious).",
      "It was Bad, she knew, but she'd really really really\nwanted to gloat.",
      "\"There's a trick, isn't there?\" said Harry, the strain showing\nin his voice. \"There has to be some trick. You can't just\nturn into a perfect general. Not on top of everything else. You're\nnot that Slytherin! You don't write creepy poetry! No one's\nthat good at everything!\u202f\"",
      "General Granger glanced around at her Sunshine Soldiers, and\nthen looked back at Harry. Everyone was probably watching this on\nthe screens outside.",
      "And General Granger said, \"I can do anything if I study hard\nenough.\"",
      "\"Oh now that's just bu-\"",
      "\"Somnium.\"",
      "Harry slumped to the ground in mid-sentence.",
      "\"SUNSHINE WINS,\" intoned the huge voice of Professor Quirrell,\nseeming to come from everywhere and nowhere.",
      "\"Niceness has triumphed!\" cried General Granger.",
      "\"Hooray!\u202f\" shouted the Sunshine Soldiers. Even the\nGryffindor boys said it, and they said it with pride.",
      "\"And what's the moral of today's battle?\" said General\nGranger.",
      "\"We can do anything if we study hard enough!\u202f\"",
      "And the survivors of the Sunshine Regiment marched off toward\nthe victory field, singing their marching song as they went:",
      "Don't be frightened, don't be sad,\nWe'll only hurt you if you're bad,\nAnd send you to a home that's true,\nWith new friends to watch over you,\nBe sure to tell them you were sent\nBy Granger's Sunshine Regiment!"

      "Harry paced backward and forward in his general's office, which\nmade a wonderful room for pacing, it didn't have any other uses as\nfar as he could tell.",
      "How?",
      "How?",
      "Hermione shouldn't have won that battle! Not on her first try,\nnot when she wasn't at all violent by her nature, automatically\nbeing a great military commander on top of everything else was too\nmuch even for her.",
      "Had she read about the tactic in a military history book? But it\nhadn't been just that one tactic, she'd had her forces perfectly\npositioned to block any retreat, her troops had been better\ncoordinated than his or Draco's...",
      "Had Professor Quirrell broken his promise not to help her? Had\nhe given her the diary of General Tacticus or something?",
      "Harry was missing something here, something really important,\nand his mind went around and around in circles, and he still\ncouldn't figure it out.",
      "Finally Harry sighed. He wasn't getting anywhere on this, and he\nhad to go learn the Breaking Drill Hex from Hermione or someone\nbefore the next battle - Professor Quirrell had explained to Harry,\nhis voice amused but with a sharp undertone of warning, that \"no\nmagical items except the ones I give you\" included Muggle\ntechnology no matter how much that wasn't magic. Plus\nHarry also needed to figure out how to bring down Mr. Goyle next\ntime...",
      "Battles counted for a lot of Quirrell points if you were a\ngeneral, and Harry needed to get cracking if he wanted to win\nProfessor Quirrell's Christmas wish.",
      "In his private room at Slytherin, Draco Malfoy stared off into\nspace, as though the wall in front of his desk was the most\nfascinating surface in the world.",
      "How?",
      "How?",
      "In retrospect it had been an obvious sort of idea as cunning\nplots went, but Granger wasn't supposed to be cunning!\nShe'd been too much of a Hufflepuff to use a Simple Strike Hex! Had\nProfessor Quirrell been advising her despite his promise, or...",
      "And then Draco finally did what he should have done much\nearlier.",
      "What he should have done after the first time he met with\nGranger.",
      "What Harry Potter had told him to do, trained\nhim to do, and yet Harry had also warned Draco that it would take\ntime to make his brain realize that the methods applied to real\nlife, and Draco hadn't understood that until today. He\ncould have avoided every single one of his mistakes if he'd just\napplied the things Harry had already told him\n-",
      "Draco said out loud, \"I notice that I am confused.\"",
      "Your strength as a rationalist is your ability to be more\nconfused by fiction than by reality...",
      "Draco was confused.",
      "Therefore, something he believed was fiction.",
      "Granger should not have been able to do all that.",
      "Therefore, she probably hadn't.",
      "I promise not to help General Granger in any way that the\ntwo of you don't know about.",
      "With sudden horrified realization, Draco swept papers out of the\nway, hunting through the mess on his desk, until he found it.",
      "And there it was.",
      "Right in the list of people and equipment assigned to each of\nthe three armies.",
      "Curse Professor Quirrell!",
      "Draco had read it and he still hadn't seen it\n-",
      "The afternoon sunlight poured down into the office of the\nSunshine Regiment, illuminating General Granger in her chair as\nthough she glowed with a golden aura.",
      "\"How long do you think it will take Malfoy to figure it out?\"\nsaid General Granger.",
      "\"Not long,\" said Colonel Blaise Zabini. \"He may have already.\nHow long will it take Potter to figure it out?\"",
      "\"Forever,\" said General Granger, \"unless Malfoy tells him, or\none of his own soldiers realizes. Harry Potter just doesn't think\nlike that.\"",
      "\"Really?\" said Captain Ernie Macmillan, looking up from one of\nthe corner tables where he was being crushed at chess by Captain\nRon Weasley. (They'd brought back all the other chairs after Malfoy\nhad left, of course.) \"I mean it seems kind of obvious to me. Who\nwould try to come up with all the ideas just by themselves?\"",
      "\"Harry,\" said Hermione, at exactly the same time Zabini said,\n\"Malfoy.\"",
      "\"Malfoy thinks he's way better than everyone else,\" said\nZabini.",
      "\"And Harry... doesn't really see most other people like\nthat,\" said Hermione.",
      "It was kind of sad, actually. Harry had grown up very, very\nalone. It wasn't that he went around thinking in words that only\ngeniuses had a right to exist. It just wouldn't occur to\nhim that anyone in Hermione's army besides Hermione could have any\ngood ideas.",
      "\"Anyhow,\" Hermione said. \"Captains Goldstein and Weasley, you're\non duty for thinking up strategic ideas for our next battle.\nCaptains Macmillan and Susan - sorry, I mean Macmillan and Bones -\ntry to come up with some tactics we can use, also any training you\nthink we should try. Oh, and congratulations on your marching song,\nCaptain Goldstein, I think it was a big plus for esprit de\ncorps.\"",
      "\"What're you doing?\" said Susan. \"And Colonel Zabini?\"",
      "Hermione stood up out of her chair, stretching. \"I'll try to\nfigure out what Harry Potter is thinking and Colonel Zabini will\ntry to figure out what Draco Malfoy might do, and both of us will\njoin you again after we come up with something. I'm going to walk\nwhile I think. Zabini, you want to come along?\"",
      "\"Yes, General,\" said Zabini stiffly.",
      "It hadn't been meant as an order. Hermione sighed to herself a\nlittle. This was going to take some getting used to, and although\nZabini's first idea had certainly worked, she wasn't quite\nsure that Professor Quirrell's quote mixture of positive and\nnegative incentives unquote would be enough to keep the Slytherin\nfully on her side until December when traitors would be allowed for\nthe first time...",
      "She still had no idea what she was going to do with Professor\nQuirrell's Christmas wish, either. Maybe she'd just ask Mandy if\nshe wanted anything, when the time came around."

      "\"But Headmaster,\" Harry argued, some of his desperation leaking\ninto his voice, \"leaving all of my assets in one undiversified\nvault full of gold coins - it's crazy, Headmaster! It's like, I\ndon't know, doing Transfiguration experiments without consulting a\nrecognized authority! You just don't do that with money!\"",
      "From the lined face of the old wizard - underneath a festive\nholiday hat like a catastrophic automobile collision between cars\nof green and red cloth - a grave, sad look peered out at Harry.",
      "\"I'm sorry, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, \"and I do apologize, but\nallowing you control over your own finances would give you far too\nmuch independence of action.\"",
      "Harry's mouth opened and no sound came out. He was, literally,\nspeechless.",
      "\"I will permit you to withdraw five Galleons for Christmas\npresents,\" said Dumbledore, \"which is more than any boy your age\nshould spend, but poses no threat, I think -\"",
      "\"I can't believe you just said that!\u202f\" the words burst\nout of Harry's mouth. \"You admit to being that\nmanipulative?\"",
      "\"Manipulative?\" said the old wizard, smiling slightly. \"No,\nmanipulative would be if I did not admit it, or if I had\nsome deeper motive behind the obvious. This is quite\nstraightforward, Harry. You are not yet ready to play the game, and\nit would be foolish to allow you thousands of Galleons with which\nto upset the gameboard.\"",
      "The bright hustle and bustle of Diagon Alley had increased by a\nhundredfold and redoubled as Christmas approached, with all the\nshops enshrouded in brilliant sorceries that flashed and sparkled\nas though the season's spirit was about to blaze out of control and\nturn the whole area into a cheerful holiday crater. The streets\nwere so crowded with witches and wizards in festive and\nloud clothing that your eyes were assaulted almost as\nseverely as your ears; and it was clear, from the bewildering\nvariety of the shoppers, that Diagon Alley was considered an\ninternational attraction. There were witches wrapped in giant\nswathes of cloth like toweled mummies, and wizards in formal top\nhats and bath-robes, and young children barely past toddling age\nwho were decorated with lights that blazed almost as bright as the\nshops themselves, as their parents took them hand in hand through\nthat magic wonderland and let them shriek to their heart's content.\nIt was the season to be merry.",
      "And in the midst of all that light and cheer, a note of blackest\nnight; a cold, dark atmosphere that cleared a few precious paces of\ndistance even in the midst of all that crush.",
      "\"No,\" said Professor Quirrell, with a look of grim revulsion,\nlike he'd just bitten into food that not only tasted horrible but\nwas morally repugnant to boot. It was the sort of grim face an\nordinary person might make after biting into a meat pie, and\ndiscovering that it was rotten and had been made from kittens.",
      "\"Oh, come on,\" Harry said. \"You must have some\nideas.\"",
      "\"Mr. Potter,\" Professor Quirrell said, his lips set in a thin\nline, \"I agreed to act as your adult guardian on this expedition. I\ndid not agree to advise you on your choice of presents. I don't do\nChristmas, Mr. Potter.\"",
      "\"How about Newtonmas?\" Harry said brightly. \"Isaac Newton\nactually was born on December 25th, unlike some other\nhistorical figures I could name.\"",
      "This failed to impress Professor Quirrell.",
      "\"Look,\" said Harry, \"I'm sorry, but I've got to do\nsomething special for Fred and George and I've got no idea\nof my options.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell made a thoughtful humming sound. \"You could\nask which family members they most dislike, and then hire an\nassassin. I know someone from a certain government-in-exile who is\nquite competent, and he would give you a discount on multiple\nWeasleys.\"",
      "\"This Christmas,\" Harry said, dropping his voice into a\nlower register, \"give your friends the gift... of\ndeath.\"",
      "That made Professor Quirrell smile. It went all the way to his\neyes.",
      "\"Well,\" said Harry, \"at least you didn't suggest getting them a\npet rat -\" Harry's mouth snapped shut, and he was regretting the\nwords almost as soon as they were out of his mouth.",
      "\"Pardon me?\" said Professor Quirrell.",
      "\"Nothing,\" Harry said at once, \"long dumb story.\" And telling it\nseemed wrong somehow, maybe because Harry was afraid Professor\nQuirrell would have laughed even if Bill Weasley hadn't\nbeen cured and everything put back to right...",
      "And where had Professor Quirrell been that he'd never\nheard the story? Harry had gotten the impression that everyone in\nmagical Britain knew.",
      "\"Look,\" said Harry, \"I'm trying to solidify their loyalty to\nme, you know? Make the Weasley twins my minions? Like the old\nsaying goes: A friend isn't someone you use once and then throw\naway, a friend is someone you use over and over again. Fred and\nGeorge are two of the most useful friends I have in Hogwarts,\nProfessor Quirrell, and I plan to use them over and over again. So\nif you'd help me be Slytherin here, and suggest something they\nmight be very grateful for...\" Harry's voice trailed off\ninvitingly.",
      "You just had to pitch these things the right way.",
      "They walked on for a good way before Professor Quirrell spoke\nagain, his voice practically dripping with distaste. \"The Weasley\ntwins are using secondhand wands, Mr. Potter. They would be\nreminded of your generosity with every Charm they cast.\"",
      "Harry clapped his hands together in involuntary excitement. Just\nput the money on account at Ollivander's, and tell Mr. Ollivander\nto never refund it - no, better yet, to send it to Lucius Malfoy if\nthe Weasley twins didn't show up before the start of their next\nschool year. \"That's brilliant, Professor!\"",
      "Professor Quirrell did not look like he appreciated the\ncompliment. \"I suppose I can tolerate Christmas in that\nspirit, Mr. Potter, though only barely.\" Then he smiled slightly.\n\"Of course that will cost you fourteen Galleons, and you only have\nfive.\"",
      "\"Five Galleons,\" Harry said, with a sniff of outrage.\n\"Just who does the Headmaster think he's dealing with, anyway?\"",
      "\"I think,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"that it simply did not\noccur to him to fear the consequences if you turned your ingenuity\nto the task of obtaining funds. Though you were wise to lose,\nrather than making it an explicit threat. Out of curiosity, Mr.\nPotter, what would you have done if I hadn't turned away\nin boredom while you, in a fit of childish pique, counted out five\nGalleons worth of Knuts?\"",
      "\"Well, the easiest way would've been to borrow money from Draco\nMalfoy,\" said Harry.",
      "Professor Quirrell chuckled briefly. \"Seriously, Mr.\nPotter.\"",
      "Duly noted. \"Probably I'd have done a few celebrity\nappearances. I wouldn't resort to anything economically disruptive\njust for spending money.\" Harry had checked, and he would\nbe allowed to keep the Time-Turner while he went home for the\nholidays, so that his sleep cycle didn't start to rotate. But then\nit was also possible that someone kept an eye out for\nmagical day traders. The gold and silver trick would've taken work\non the Muggle end, and seed funding, and the goblins might've\ngotten suspicious after the first cycle. And starting a real bank\nwould be a lot of work... Harry hadn't quite\nworked out any money-making methods that were fast and\ncertain and safe, so he'd been very glad when Professor\nQuirrell had turned out to be so easily fooled.",
      "\"I do hope those five Galleons will be enough to last, since you\ncounted them so carefully,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"I doubt the\nHeadmaster shall be so eager to entrust me with your vault key a\nsecond time, once he discovers I've been tricked.\"",
      "\"I'm sure you did your best,\" Harry said with deep\ngratitude.",
      "\"Do you need any assistance finding a safe place to store all\nthose Knuts, Mr. Potter?\"",
      "\"Well, sort of,\" said Harry. \"Do you know of any good investment\nopportunities, Professor Quirrell?\"",
      "And the two of them walked on, in their tiny sphere of silence\nand isolation, through the brilliant and bustling crowds; and if\nyou looked carefully, you would see that where they went, leafy\nboughs faded, and flowers withered, and children's toys that played\ncheerful bells changed to lower and more ominous notes.",
      "Harry did notice, but he didn't say anything, just\nsmiled a little to himself.",
      "Everyone had their own way of celebrating the holidays, and the\nGrinch was as much a part of Christmas as Santa."

And they fight against their opponents knowing\nnot for what end they imperil themselves... So there grows\nup in them against their fellow men a hostility which has no cause,\nand at no time does it cease or disappear, for it gives place\nneither to the ties of marriage nor of relationship nor of\nfriendship, and the case is the same even though those who differ\nwith respect to these colours be brothers or any other kin. I, for\nmy part, am unable to call this anything except a disease of the\nsoul...\"",

      "Professor Quirrell's eyes moved beneath their lids to regard\nDraco, and then Granger. \"In truth, Mr. Malfoy, Miss Granger, I\nsimply could not live with myself if I shut down the grand debacle\nbefore its climax. One of your soldiers has even become a quadruple\nagent.\"",
      "\"Quadruple?\u202f\" said Granger. \"But there's only three\nsides in the war!\"",
      "\"Yes,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"you'd think that, wouldn't you.\nI am not sure that there has ever in history been a quadruple\nagent, or any army with such a high fraction of real and pretended\ntraitors. We are exploring new realms, Miss Granger, and we cannot\nturn back now.\"",
      "Draco left the Defense Professor's office with his teeth\ngritting hard against each other, and Granger looking even more\nannoyed beside him.",
      "\"I can't believe you did that, Harry!\" said Granger.",
      "\"Sorry,\" Harry said, not sounding sorry at all, his lips curved\nup in a merry smile of evil. \"Remember, Hermione, it is\njust a game, and why should generals like us be the only ones who\nget to plot? And besides, what are the two of you going to do about\nit? Team up against me?\"",
      "Draco traded glances with Granger, knowing that his own face was\nas tight as hers. Harry had been relying, more and more openly and\ngloatingly, on Draco's refusal to make common cause with a mudblood\ngirl; and Draco was beginning to get sick of having that\nused against him. If this kept up much longer he was going\nto ally with Granger just to crush Harry Potter, and see how much\nthe son of a mudblood liked that.",
      "The terrifying part was how fast the whole thing had spiraled\nout of control.",
      "Hermione stared at the parchment Zabini had given her, feeling\nutterly and completely helpless.",
      "There were names, and lines connecting the names to other names,\nand some of the lines were in different colors and...",
      "\"Tell me,\" said General Granger, \"is there anyone in my army who\nisn't a spy?\"",
      "The two of them weren't in the office but in another, deserted\nclassroom, and they were alone; because, Colonel Zabini had said,\nit was now nearly certain that at least one of the captains was a\ntraitor. Probably Captain Goldstein, but Zabini didn't know for\nsure.",
      "Her question had put an ironic smile on the young Slytherin's\nface. Blaise Zabini always seemed a little disdainful of her, but\nhe didn't seem to actively dislike her; nothing like the derision\nhe held for Draco Malfoy, or the resentment he had developed for\nHarry Potter. She had worried at first about Zabini betraying her,\nbut the boy seemed desperate to show that the other two generals\nwere no better than him; and Hermione thought that while Zabini\nwould probably be happy to sell her out to anyone else,\nhe'd never let Malfoy or Harry win.",
      "\"Most of your soldiers are still loyal to you, I'm\npretty sure,\" said Zabini. \"It's just that no one wants to be left\nout of the fun.\" The scornful look on the Slytherin's face made it\nclear what he thought of people who didn't take plotting seriously.\n\"So they think they can be double agents and secretly work for our\nside while pretending to betray us.\"",
      "\"And that would also go for anyone in the other armies\nwho says they want to be our spy,\" Hermione said\ncarefully.",
      "The young Slytherin shrugged. \"I think I did a good job of\ntelling which ones really want to sell out Malfoy, I'm not sure\nanyone really wants to sell out Potter to you. But Nott is\na sure bet for betraying Potter to Malfoy and since I had\nEntwhistle approach him supposedly on behalf of Malfoy and\nEntwhistle really reports to us, that's almost as good -\"",
      "Hermione closed her eyes for a moment. \"We're going to lose,\naren't we?\"",
      "\"Look,\" Zabini said patiently, \"You're in the lead right now on\nQuirrell points. We just have to not lose this last battle\ncompletely and you'll have enough Quirrell points to win\nthe Christmas wish.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell had announced that the final battle would\noperate on a formal scoring system, which he'd been asked to do to\navoid recriminations afterward. Each time you shot someone, the\ngeneral of your army got two Quirrell points. A gong would ring\nthrough the battle area (they didn't know yet where they would be\nfighting, though Hermione was hoping for the forest again, where\nSunshine did well) and its pitch would tell which army had won the\npoints. And if anyone was faking being hit, the gong would ring out\nanyway, and then a double gong would ring later, after no fixed\ntime, to hail the retraction. And if you called the name of an\narmy, cried \"For Sunshine!\" or \"For Chaos!\" or \"For Dragon!\", it\nswitched your allegiance to that army...",
      "Even Hermione had been able to see the flaw in that set\nof rules. But Professor Quirrell had gone on to announce that if\nyou'd been originally assigned to Sunshine, nobody could shoot you\nin the name of Sunshine - or rather, they could, but then Sunshine\nlost a single Quirrell point, symbolized by a triple gong. That\nprevented you from shooting your own soldiers for points, and\ndiscouraged suiciding before the enemy got you, but you could still\nshoot spies if you had to.",
      "Right now, Hermione had two hundred and forty-four Quirrell\npoints, and Malfoy had two hundred and nineteen, and Harry had two\nhundred and twenty-one; and there were twenty-four soldiers in each\narmy.",
      "\"So we fight carefully,\" Hermione said, \"and just try not to\nlose too badly.\"",
      "\"No,\" said Zabini. The young Slytherin's face was now serious.\n\"The problem is, Malfoy and Potter both know that their only way to\nwin is to combine and crush us, then fight it out on their own. So\nhere's what I think we should do -\"",
      "Hermione left the classroom in something of a daze. Zabini's\nplan hadn't been the obvious one, it had been strange and\ncomplicated and layered and the sort of thing she would've expected\nHarry to come up with, not Zabini. It felt wrong just for her to be\nable to understand a plan like that. Young girls shouldn't\nbe able to understand plans like that. The Hat would've Sorted her\ninto Slytherin, if it'd seen that she could understand plans like\nthat...",
      "The awesome thing was how fast he'd been able to escalate the\nchaos once he started doing it deliberately.",
      "Harry sat in his office; he'd been given the authority to order\nfurniture from the house elves, so he'd ordered a throne, and\ncurtains in a black and crimson pattern. Scarlet light like blood,\nmixed with shadow, poured over the floor.",
      "Something in Harry felt like he'd finally come home.",
      "Before him stood the four Lieutenants of Chaos, his most trusted\nminions, one of whom was a traitor.",
      "This. This was what life should be like.",
      "\"We are gathered,\" said Harry.",
      "\"Let Chaos reign,\" chorused his four Lieutenants.",
      "\"My hovercraft is full of eels,\" said Harry.",
      "\"I will not buy this record, it is scratched,\" chorused his four\nLieutenants.",
      "\"All mimsy were the borogroves.\"",
      "\"And the mome raths outgrabe!\"",
      "That concluded the formalities.",
      "\"How goes the confusion?\" Harry said in a dry whisper like\nEmperor Palpatine.",
      "\"It goes well, General Chaos,\" said Neville in the tone he\nalways used for military matters, a tone so deep that the boy often\nhad to stop and cough. The Chaotic Lieutenant was neatly dressed in\nhis black school robes, trimmed in the yellow of Hufflepuff House,\nand his hair was parted and combed in the usual look for an earnest\nyoung boy. Harry had liked the incongruity better than any of the\ncloaks they'd tried. \"Our Legionnaires have begun five new plots\nsince yesterday evening.\"",
      "Harry smiled evilly. \"Do any of them have a chance of\nworking?\"",
      "\"I don't think so,\" said Neville of Chaos. \"Here's the\nreport.\"",
      "\"Excellent,\" said Harry, and laughed chillingly as he took the\nparchment from Neville's hand, trying his best to make it sound\nlike he was choking on dust. That brought the total to sixty.",
      "Let Draco try to handle that. Let him try.",
      "And as for Blaise Zabini...",
      "Harry laughed again, and this time it didn't even take an effort\nto sound evil. He really needed to borrow someone's pet Kneazle for\nhis staff meetings, so he'd have a cat to stroke while he did\nthis.",
      "\"Can the Legion stop making plots now?\" said Finnigan of Chaos.\n\"I mean, don't we have enough already -\"",
      "\"No,\" Harry said flatly. \"We can never have enough\nplots.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell had put it perfectly. They were pushing the\nboundaries further, perhaps, than they had ever been pushed; and\nHarry wouldn't have been able to live with himself if he'd turned\nback now.",
      "There came a knock at the door.",
      "\"That will be the Dragon General,\" Harry said, smiling with evil\nprescience. \"He arrives precisely as I expected. Do show him in,\nand yourselves out.\"",
      "And the four Lieutenants of Chaos shuffled out, casting dark\nlooks at Draco as the enemy general entered into Harry's secret\nlair.",
      "If he wasn't allowed to do this when he was older, Harry was\njust going to stay eleven forever.",
      "The sun was dripping through the red curtains, sending rays of\nblood dancing across the floor from behind Harry Potter's\ngrownup-sized cushioned chair, which he had covered in gold and\nsilver glitter and insisted on referring to as his throne.",
      "(Draco was beginning to feel a lot more confident that he'd done\nthe right thing in deciding to overthrow Harry Potter before he\ncould take over the world. Draco couldn't even imagine\nwhat it would be like to live under his rule.)",
      "\"Good evening, Dragon General,\" said Harry Potter in a chill\nwhisper. \"You have arrived just as I expected.\"",
      "This was not surprising, considering that Draco and Harry had\nagreed on the meeting time in advance.",
      "And it also wasn't evening, but by now Draco knew better than to\nsay anything.",
      "\"General Potter,\" Draco said with as much dignity as he could\nmanage, \"you know that our two armies have to work together for\neither of us to win Professor Quirrell's wish, right?\"",
      "\"Yesss,\" hissed Harry, like the boy thought he was a\nParselmouth. \"We must cooperate to destroy Sunshine, and only then\nfight it out between us. But if one of us betrays the other earlier\non, that one could gain an advantage in the later fight. And the\nSunshine General, who knows all this, will try to trick each of us\ninto thinking the other has betrayed them. And you and I, who know\nthat, will be tempted to betray the other and pretend that it is\nGranger's trickery. And Granger knows that, as well.\"",
      "Draco nodded. That much was obvious. \"And... both of us\nonly want to win, and there's no one else who'll punish\neither of us if we defect...\"",
      "\"Precisely,\" said Harry Potter, his face now turning serious.\n\"We are faced with a true Prisoner's Dilemma.\"",
      "The Prisoner's Dilemma, according to Harry's teachings, ran\nthus: Two prisoners had been locked in separate cells. There was\nevidence against each prisoner, but only minor evidence, enough for\na prison sentence of two years apiece. Each prisoner could opt to\ndefect, betray the other, testify against them in court;\nand this would take one year off their own prison sentence, but add\ntwo years to the other's. Or a prisoner could cooperate,\nstaying silent. So if both prisoners defected, each testifying\nagainst the other, they would serve three years apiece; if both\ncooperated, or stayed silent, they would serve two years each; but\nif one defected and the other cooperated, the defector would serve\na single year, and the cooperator would serve four.",
      "And both prisoners had to make their decision without knowing\nthe other one's choice, and neither would be given a chance to\nchange their decision afterward.",
      "Draco had observed that if the two prisoners had been Death\nEaters during the Wizarding War, the Dark Lord would have killed\nany traitors.",
      "Harry had nodded and said that was one way to resolve\nthe Prisoner's Dilemma - and in fact both Death Eaters would\nwant there to be a Dark Lord for exactly that reason.",
      "(Draco had asked Harry to stop and let him to think about this\nfor a while before they continued. It had explained a lot\nabout why Father and his friends had agreed to serve under a Dark\nLord who often wasn't nice to them...)",
      "In fact, Harry had said, this was pretty much the reason why\npeople had governments - you might be better off if you\nstole from someone else, just like each prisoner would be\nindividually better off if they defected in the Prisoner's Dilemma.\nBut if everyone thought like that, the country would fall\ninto chaos and everyone would be worse off, like what would happen\nif both prisoners defected. So people let themselves be ruled by\ngovernments, just like the Death Eaters had let themselves be ruled\nby the Dark Lord.",
      "(Draco had asked Harry to stop again. Draco had always taken for\ngranted that ambitious wizards put themselves in power because they\nwanted to rule, and people let themselves be ruled because they\nwere scared little Hufflepuffs. And this, on reflection, still\nseemed true; but Harry's perspective was fascinating even if it was\nwrong.)",
      "But, Harry had continued afterward, the fear of a third party\npunishing you was not the only possible reason to\ncooperate in the Prisoner's Dilemma.",
      "Suppose, Harry had said, you were playing the game against a\nmagically produced identical copy of yourself.",
      "Draco had said that if there were two Dracos, of course neither\nDraco would want anything bad to happen to the other one, not to\nmention that no Malfoy would let himself become known as a\ntraitor.",
      "Harry had nodded again, and said that this was yet\nanother solution to the Prisoner's Dilemma - people might\ncooperate because they cared about each other, or because they had\nsenses of honor, or because they wanted to preserve their\nreputation. Indeed, Harry had said, it was rather difficult to\nconstruct a true Prisoner's Dilemma - in real life, people\nusually cared about the other person, or their honor or their\nreputation or a Dark Lord's punishment or something\nbesides the prison sentences. But suppose the copy had been of\nsomeone completely selfish -",
      "(Pansy Parkinson had been the example they'd used)",
      "- so each Pansy only cared what happened to her and not\nto the other Pansy.",
      "Given that this was all Pansy cared about... and that\nthere was no Dark Lord... and Pansy wasn't worried about her\nreputation... and Pansy either had no sense of honor or didn't\nconsider herself obligated to the other prisoner... then\nwould the rational thing be for Pansy to cooperate, or defect?",
      "Some people, Harry said, claimed that the rational thing to do\nwas for Pansy to defect against her copy, but Harry, plus someone\nnamed Douglas Hofstadter, thought these people were wrong. Because,\nHarry had said, if Pansy defected - not at random, but for what\nseemed to her like rational reasons - then the other Pansy\nwould think exactly the same way. Two identical copies wouldn't\ndecide different things. So Pansy had to choose between a world in\nwhich both Pansies cooperated, or a world in which both Pansies\ndefected, and she was better off if both copies cooperated. And if\nHarry had thought 'rational' people did defect in the\nPrisoner's Dilemma, then he wouldn't have done anything to spread\nthat kind of 'rationality', because a country or a conspiracy full\nof 'rational' people would dissolve into chaos. You would tell your\nenemies about 'rationality'.",
      "Which had all sounded reasonable at the time, but\nnow the thought was occurring to Draco that...",
      "\"You said,\" Draco said, \"that the rational solution to\nthe Prisoner's Dilemma is to cooperate. But of course you\nwould want me to believe that, wouldn't you?\" And if Draco was\nfooled into cooperating, Harry would just say, Ha ha, betrayed\nyou again! and laugh at him about it afterward.",
      "\"I wouldn't fake your lessons,\" Harry said seriously. \"But I\nhave to remind you, Draco, that I didn't say you should just\nautomatically cooperate. Not on a true Prisoner's Dilemma\nlike this one. What I said was that when you choose, you shouldn't\nthink like you're choosing for just yourself, or like\nyou're choosing for everyone. You should think like you're choosing\nfor all the people who are similar enough to you that\nthey'll probably do the same thing you do for the same reasons. And\nalso choosing the predictions made by anyone who knows you well\nenough to predict you accurately, so that you never have to regret\nbeing rational because of the correct predictions that other people\nmake about you - remind me to explain about Newcomb's Problem at\nsome point. So the question you and I have to ask, Draco, is this:\nare we similar enough that we'll probably do the same\nthing whatever it is, making our decisions in mostly the same\nway? Or do we know each other well enough to predict each other, so\nthat I can predict whether you'll cooperate or defect, and\nyou can predict that I've decided to do the same thing I\npredict you'll do, because I know that you can predict me\ndeciding that?\"",
      "...and Draco could not help but think that since he had to\nstrain just to understand half of that, the answer was\nobviously 'No'.",
      "\"Yes,\" said Draco.",
      "There was a pause.",
      "\"I see,\" said Harry, sounding disappointed. \"Oh, well. I guess\nwe'll have to think of some other way, then.\"",
      "Draco hadn't thought that was going to work.",
      "Draco and Harry talked about it back and forth. They had both\nagreed much earlier that what they did on the battlefield would\nnot count as broken promises in real life - though Draco\nwas a little angry about what Harry had done in Professor\nQuirrell's office, and said so.",
      "But if the two of them couldn't rely on honor or friendship,\nthat did leave the question of how to get their armies to\nwork together on beating Sunshine, despite everything Granger might\ntry to break them up. Professor Quirrell's rules didn't make it\ntempting to let Sunshine kill the other army's soldiers - that just\nincreased the bar you had to pass yourself - but it did tempt each\nside to steal kills instead of acting like a single army would, or\nto shoot some of the other side's soldiers during the confusion of\nbattle...",
      "Hermione was walking back to Ravenclaw not really looking where\nshe was going, her mind preoccupied with war and treachery and\nother age-inappropriate concepts, and she turned a corner and\nbumped straight into a grownup.",
      "\"Sorry,\" she said automatically, and then, entirely without\nthinking, \"Eeeeek!\u202f\"",
      "\"Don't worry, Miss Granger,\" said the cheerful smile, set\nbeneath the twinkling eyes, and above the silver beard, of the\nHEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS. \"You are quite forgiven.\"",
      "Her gaze was helplessly locked on the kindly face of the most\npowerful wizard in the world, who was also the Chief Warlock, who\nwas also the Supreme Mugwump, who had gone insane years ago from\nthe stress of fighting the Dark Lord, and numerous other facts that\nwere popping up into her mind one after the other while her throat\nwent on making little embarrassing squeaks.",
      "\"In fact, Miss Granger,\" said Albus Percival Wulfric Brian\nDumbledore, \"it is quite lucky that we bumped into each other. Why,\nI was just now wondering curiously what the three of you were\nthinking of asking for your wishes...\"",
      "Saturday dawned bright and clear and with the students speaking\nin hushed voices, as though the first to shout might set off the\nexplosion.",
      "Draco had hoped that they would be fighting in the upper levels\nof Hogwarts again. Professor Quirrell had said that real fights\nwere more likely to take place in cities than forests, and fighting\ninside schoolrooms and corridors was supposed to simulate that,\nwith ribbons to mark the allowed areas. Dragon Army had done well\nin those fights.",
      "Instead, just as Draco had feared, Professor Quirrell had come\nup with something special for this battle.",
      "The battleground was the Hogwarts Lake.",
      "And not in boats, either.",
      "They were fighting underwater.",
      "The Giant Squid had been temporarily paralyzed; spells had been\nset in place to keep away the grindylows; Professor Quirrell had\ngone and talked to the merfolk; and all the soldiers had been\nissued potions of underwater action that allowed them to\nbreathe, see clearly, talk to each other, and swim not quite as\nfast as a fast walk by kicking their legs.",
      "A huge silver sphere hung in the center of the battleground,\nshining like a small underwater moon. It would help to provide a\nsense of direction - at first. The moon would slowly go into\neclipse as the battle went on, and when it had gone entirely dark,\nthe battle would end if it hadn't already.",
      "War in water. You couldn't defend a perimeter, attackers could\ncome at you from any direction, and even with the potion you\ncouldn't see very far in the darkness of the lake.",
      "And if you swam too far away from the action, you would start to\nglow after a while, and be easy to hunt down - ordinarily if an\narmy scattered and ran instead of fighting, Professor Quirrell\nwould just declare them defeated; but today they were working on a\npoints system. Of course you still had some time before\nyou started to glow, if you wanted to play assassin.",
      "Dragon Army had been set low in the water at the start of the\ngame; above and far away, the distant underwater moon shone. The\nmurky water was mostly lit by Lumos Charms, though his\nsoldiers would extinguish the lights as soon as they began\nmaneuvers. There was no point in letting the enemy see you before\nyou saw them.",
      "Draco kicked his legs a few times, propelling him to a higher\nposition from which he could gaze down at where his soldiers\nhovered in the water.",
      "The conversations died down almost at once under Draco's icy\nglare, his soldiers looking up at him with gratifying expressions\nof fear and worry.",
      "\"Listen to me very carefully,\" said General Malfoy. His voice\ncame out a little lower, a little burbly with bubbles, libsten\nto me vebwy caerbfully, but the sound traveled clearly.\n\"There's only one way we can win this. We've got to march on\nSunshine together with Chaos, and beat Sunshine. Then we\nfight it out with Potter and win. That's got to happen,\nunderstand? No matter what else goes on, that part has to\nhappen that way -\"",
      "And Draco explained the plan he and Harry had come up with.",
      "Astonished looks were exchanged among the soldiers.",
      "\"- and if any of your plots get in the way of that,\"\nfinished Draco, \"after we are out of the water, I will set you on\nfire.\"",
      "There was a nervous chorus of yessirs.",
      "\"And everyone with secret orders, make sure you carry them out\nto the letter,\" said Draco.",
      "Around half his soldiers openly nodded, and Draco\nmarked them for death after he rose to power.",
      "Of course all the private orders were fake, like one Dragon\nbeing told to offer a false traitor's commission to another Dragon,\nand the second Dragon being told in hushed confidence to report\nanything said by the first Dragon. Draco had told each Dragon that\nthe whole war could depend on that one thing, and that he hoped\nthey understood it was more important than the plans they'd\npreviously made. With luck that would keep all the idiots happy,\nand maybe flush out a few spies to boot, if the reports didn't\nmatch the instructions.",
      "Draco's real plan for winning against Chaos... well, it was\nsimpler than the one he'd burned, but Father still wouldn't have\nliked it. Despite trying, though, Draco hadn't been able to think\nof anything better. It was a plot that couldn't possibly\nhave worked against anyone except Harry Potter. In fact it had\nbeen Harry's plan originally, according to the traitor,\nthough Draco had guessed that without being told. Draco and the\ntraitor had just modified it a little...",
      "Harry took a deep breath, feeling the water gurgle harmlessly in\nhis lungs.",
      "They'd fought in the forest, and he hadn't gotten a chance to\nsay it.",
      "They'd fought in the corridors of Hogwarts, and he hadn't gotten\na chance to say it.",
      "They'd fought in the air, broomsticks issued to every soldier,\nand it still hadn't made sense to say it.",
      "Harry had thought he wouldn't ever get to say those words, not\nwhile he was still young enough for them to be real...",
      "The Chaos Legionnaires were looking at Harry in puzzlement, as\ntheir general swam with his feet pointing up toward the distant\nlight of the surface, and his head pointed down toward the murky\ndepths.",
      "\"Why are you upside down?\u202f\" the young commander shouted\nat his army, and began to explain how to fight after you abandoned\nthe privileged orientation of gravity.",
      "A hollow, booming bell echoed through the water, and on the\ninstant, Zabini and Anthony and five other soldiers struck out\ndownward, into the murky depths of the lake. Parvati Patil, the\nonly Gryffindor in the group, turned her head back for a moment and\ngave them all a cheery wave as she dived; and after a moment, Scott\nand Matt did the same. The rest just sank and vanished.",
      "General Granger swallowed a lump in her throat as she watched\nthem go. She was risking everything on this, dividing her army\ninstead of just trying to take as many enemy soldiers with them as\npossible.",
      "The thing to realize, Zabini had told her, was that no army\nwould move until they had a plan that let them expect victory.\nSunshine couldn't just plan to win themselves, they had to make\nboth other armies think they would win until it was too\nlate.",
      "Ernie and Ron still looked like they were in shock. Susan was\ngazing after the disappearing soldiers with a calculating look. Her\narmy, what was left of it, just looked bewildered, traceries of\nlight dappling on their uniforms as they all drifted just below the\nsunlit surface of the lake.",
      "\"Now what?\" said Ron.",
      "\"Now we wait,\" said Hermione, loudly enough for all the soldiers\nto hear. It felt odd to talk with her mouth full of water, she kept\nfeeling like she was committing some sort of horrible impoliteness\nat the dinner table and was about to drool all over herself. \"All\nof us left here are going to get zapped, but that was going to\nhappen anyway with Dragon and Chaos ganging up on us. We've just\ngot to take as many of them with us as we can.\"",
      "\"I've got a plan,\" said one of her Sunshine Soldiers... Hannah,\nher voice had been a little hard to recognize at first. \"It's like\nall complicated, but I know how we can get Dragon and Chaos to\nstart fighting each other -\"",
      "\"Me too!\" said Fay. \"I've got a plan too! See, Neville\nLongbottom is secretly on our side -\"",
      "\"You were talking to Neville?\" said Ernie. \"That's not\nright, I was the one who -\"",
      "Daphne Greengrass and a couple of other Slytherins who hadn't\ngone with Zabini were giggling helplessly as the cries of \"No,\nwait, I was the one who got Longbottom\" erupted from one\nsoldier after another.",
      "Hermione just looked at them all wearily.",
      "\"Okay,\" said Hermione when it had all died down, \"does everyone\nget it? All your plots were faked by the Chaos Legion, or maybe\nsome by Dragon. Anyone who really wanted to betray Harry\nor Malfoy went straight to me or Zabini, not you. Just go ahead and\ncompare notes on all your secret plots and you'll see it for\nyourselves.\" She might not be as good at plotting as Zabini, but\nshe could always understand what all her officers told her, that\nwas why Professor Quirrell had made her the general. \"So don't\nbother trying to do any plots when the other armies get here. Just\nfight, okay? Please?\"",
      "\"But,\" said Ernie with shock on his face, \"Neville is in\nHufflepuff! You're saying he lied to us?\"",
      "Daphne was laughing so hard and so helplessly that the\nexhalations had turned her upside down in the water.",
      "\"I'm not sure what Longbottom is,\" said Ron darkly,\n\"but I don't think he's a Hufflepuff any more. Not now that\nHarry Potter's got to him.\"",
      "\"Do you know,\" said Susan, \"I asked him that, and\nNeville told me he had become a Chaos Hufflepuff?\"",
      "\"Anyway,\" said Hermione in a loud voice. \"Zabini took\nwith everyone who we thought was a spy, so in our army we\ncan stop watching each other quite so hard now, I hope.\"",
      "\"Anthony was a spy?\" yelled Ron.",
      "\"Parvati was a spy?\" gasped Hannah.",
      "\"Parvati was totally a spy,\" said Daphne. \"She shopped\nat the spy shoe store and wore spy lipstick, and someday she's\ngoing to marry a nice spy husband and have a lot of little\nspies.\"",
      "And then a gong sound echoed through the water, indicating that\nSunshine had just scored two points.",
      "This was shortly followed by the triple gong of Dragon losing a\nsingle point.",
      "Traitors weren't allowed to kill generals, not after the\ndisaster of the first battle in December when all three generals\nhad been shot in the first minute. But with any luck...",
      "\"Aw,\" said Hermione. \"It sounds like Mr. Crabbe is taking a\nlittle nap.\"",
      "Like two shoals of fish, the armies swam along.",
      "Neville Longbottom kicked his feet in slow, measured motions.\nDiving, always diving in whatever direction you happened to be\nmoving. You wanted to show the enemy the smallest profile, present\nthem with your head or your feet. So you were always diving,\ndownward and head-first, and the enemy was always\ndown.",
      "Like every Chaos Legionnaire in the army, Neville's head was\nconstantly rotating as he swam, looking up, down, around, to every\nside. Not just watching for Sunshine Soldiers, but watching for any\nsign that a Chaos Legionnaire had drawn their wand and was about to\nbetray them. Usually traitors waited until the confusion of battle\nto make their move, but that early gong had put them all on\nguard.",
      "...the truth was, Neville was feeling sad about that. In\nNovember he'd been a soldier in a united army, all of them pulling\ntogether and helping each other, and now they were all watching\neach other constantly for the first signs of betrayal. It might\nhave been more fun for General Chaos, but it wasn't nearly as much\nfun for Neville.",
      "The direction formerly known as 'up' was getting steadily\nbrighter, as they came closer to the surface and Sunshine.",
      "\"Wands out,\" said General Chaos.",
      "Neville's squad drew their wands, pointing them straight ahead\ntoward the enemy, as their heads scanned around more rapidly. If\nthere were Sunny traitors, the time was approaching for them to\nstrike.",
      "The other shoal of fish, Dragon Army, was doing the same\nthing.",
      "\"Now!\u202f\" shouted the distant voice of the Dragon\nGeneral.",
      "\"Now!\u202f\" shouted General Chaos.",
      "\"For Sunshine!\" shouted all the soldiers in both\narmies, and charged downward.",
      "\"What?\u202f\" said Minerva involuntarily as she watched the\nscreens from next to the lake, a cry echoed in many other places;\nall of Hogwarts was watching this battle as they had watched the\nfirst.",
      "Professor Quirrell was laughing dryly. \"I warned you,\nHeadmaster. It is impossible to have rules without Mr. Potter\nexploiting them.\"",
      "For long precious seconds, as the forty-seven soldiers charged\nher own seventeen, Hermione's mind went blank.",
      "Why...",
      "Then it all snapped into place.",
      "Every time a soldier originally from Sunshine got shot by\nsomeone crying the name of Sunshine, she would lose a Quirrell\npoint. When two Sunshine Soldiers were shot by either army,\nboth enemy armies would be two points closer to overtaking\nher, it was the same gain only shared. And if anyone shot\nanother soldier not in the name of Sunshine, that gong\nwouldn't get lost in the confusion...",
      "Hermione was suddenly very glad that Zabini hadn't gone with the\nobvious plan of starting trouble between the other two armies while\nthey attacked Sunshine.",
      "It was still disheartening, though, that sense of your chances\nclosing down, of hope being taken away.",
      "Most of Hermione's soldiers were still looking confused, but\nsome had expressions of dawning horror as they got it.",
      "\"It's all right,\" Susan Bones said firmly. Heads turned to look\nat the Sunshine Captain. \"Our job is the same, to take as many of\nthem with us as we can. And remember, Zabini took away all the\nspies! We don't have to stay on the lookout like they do!\"\nThe girl was smiling defiantly, provoking answering smiles from\nmany of the other soldiers, even from Hermione herself. \"It can be\nlike it was in November. We just have to keep our heads high, fight\nour best, and trust each other -\"",
      "Daphne shot her.",
      "\"Blood for the blood god!\u202f\" shrieked Neville of Chaos,\nthough since he was underwater it came out more like 'Blubbled for\nthe blubbled glub!'",
      "Captain Weasley spun and raised his wand toward Neville and\nfired. But Neville was swimming downward toward him, wand\npointed straight ahead, and that meant the Simple Shield could\nshelter Neville's entire profile; if anyone shot him now, it wasn't\ngoing to be Sunny Ron.",
      "A grimly determined look came over Captain Weasley's face, and\nhe arrowed straight up toward Neville, mouthing the word\nContego, though the shield wasn't visible in the\nwater.",
      "The two enemy champions shot toward each other like arrows\nreleased from bows, each aimed to split the other down the middle.\nThey had dueled many times before, but this time would pay for\nall.",
      "(Far away by the lakeside, a hundred breaths were held.)",
      "\"Rainbows and unicorns!\u202f\" roared the Sunshine\nCaptain.",
      "\"The Black Goat with a thousand young!\u202f\"",
      "\"Do your homework!\u202f\"",
      "Closer and yet closer, the two champions charged, neither\nwilling to swerve, the first person to turn would present a\nvulnerable broadside and get shot, though if neither lost their\nnerve they would crash right into each other...",
      "Falling straight down as the enemy rose straight up to meet him,\nhammer descending to meet anvil in a path neither was willing to\nleave...",
      "\"Special attack, Chaotic Twist!\u202f\"",
      "Neville saw the look of horror on Captain Weasley's face as the\nHover Charm caught him. They'd tested it before the battle had\nstarted; and just as Harry had suspected, Wingardium\nLeviosa became a whole new sort of weapon once everyone was\nswimming underwater.",
      "\"Curse you, Longbottom!\u202f\" shrieked Ron Weasley,\n\"Can't you ever fight without your dumb special attacks\n-\"",
      "and by that time the Sunshine Captain had been spun around\nsideways and Neville shot him in the leg.",
      "\"I don't fight fair,\" said Neville to the sleeping form, \"I\nfight like Harry Potter.\"",
      "Granger: 237 / Malfoy: 217 / Potter: 220",
      "It still hurt every time he had to shoot Hermione. Harry could\nhardly stand to look at the expression of peace that had come over\nher sleeping face, arms now drifting aimlessly as the curves of\nsunlight moved over her camouflage uniform and the cloud of her\nchestnut hair.",
      "And if Harry had tried to duck out of being the one to shoot\nher... not only would Draco have known what it meant,\nHermione would have been offended.",
      "She's not dead, Harry said to his brain as his kicking\nfeet pushed him away, she's just resting. IDIOT.",
      "Are you sure? said his brain. What if she's an\nex-Hermione? Could we go back and check?",
      "Harry glanced back briefly.",
      "See, she's fine, there are bubbles coming out of her\nmouth.",
      "Could've been her last breath escaping.",
      "Oh be quiet. Why are you being so paranoid-protective,\nanyway?",
      "Er, first real friend we've ever had in our whole life? Hey,\nremember what happened to our pet rock?",
      "Would you SHUT UP about that worthless lump of rubble, it\nwasn't even alive let alone sentient, that is like the most\npathetic childhood trauma ever -",
      "The two armies swiftly separated, becoming two shoals of fish\nonce more.",
      "General Granger had gone down seventeen points, and taken three\nChaotics and two Dragons with her; and one Chaotic and two Dragons\nhad been shot as traitors. So she'd lost net seven points, Harry\nhad lost one, Draco had lost two; that put Sunshine twenty points\nup on Dragon, and seventeen points up on Chaos. Chaos could still\nwin easily if they exterminated all twenty remaining Dragons. The\nwild card, of course, being those seven remaining Sunshine\nSoldiers...",
      "...if you could call them that.",
      "The two shoals swam uneasily next to each other, the soldiers in\neach army awaiting an order to call out their true allegiances, and\nattack...",
      "\"Everyone who got them,\" Harry said loudly, \"remember Special\nOrders One through Three. And don't forget it's Merlin Says on\nThree. Do not acknowledge.\"",
      "The trustworthy two-thirds of the army did not nod, and the\nother third just looked puzzled.",
      "Special Order One: Don't bother trying to call out any\ncodewords in this battle, don't expend effort on any plot not\nspecially approved by the commander; just swim, shield, and\nfire.",
      "Hermione and Draco had both been fighting their soldiers, trying\nto get them to stop plotting on their own all through December.\nHarry had egged his soldiers on and supported their plotting\nthrough the last two battles... while also telling them that at\nsome future point he might ask them to put a plot or two\non hold, to which they'd all readily agreed. So now, in this\ncritical battle, they were happy to obey.",
      "Neither Hermione or Draco could have given that order\nsuccessfully, Harry was certain. It was the difference between your\nsoldiers seeing you as an ally in their plotting, and seeing you as\na spoilsport old fuddy-duddy who didn't want them to have any fun.\nImposition of order equaled escalation of chaos, and it also worked\nin reverse...",
      "\"There they are!\" shouted someone, and pointed.",
      "From the depths of the lake arose the forgotten ones, the ones\nwho'd forsaken the last battle, the seven missing Sunshine\nSoldiers, glowing with the bright aura of cowards, now fading as\nthey returned to battle.",
      "The two shoals of fish wavered, pointing wands uneasily.",
      "\"Hold your fire!\" shouted Harry, and a similar cry came from\nGeneral Malfoy.",
      "There was a moment of held breath.",
      "Then the seven Sunshine Soldiers swam up to join Dragon\nArmy.",
      "There was a triumphant cheer from Dragon Army.",
      "There were cries of dismay from a third of the Chaos Legion.",
      "Some of the other two-thirds smiled, though they shouldn't\nhave.",
      "Harry wasn't smiling.",
      "Oh, this is so completely not going to work...",
      "But Harry hadn't been able to think of anything better.",
      "\"Special Orders Two and Three still apply!\" shouted Harry.\n\"Fight!\"",
      "\"For the Chaos Legion!\u202f\" roared twenty Chaotic\nLegionnaires.",
      "\"For Dragon Army!\u202f\" roared twenty Dragon Warriors and\nseven Sunshine Soldiers.",
      "And the Chaotics dived straight downward, as all the traitors\ngot ready to strike.",
      "Granger: 237 / Malfoy: 220 / Potter: 226",
      "Draco's head darted around frantically, trying to weigh up what\nwas happening; somehow, despite his greater forces, he'd lost\nthe initiative. Four small Chaotic forces were being pursued\nby four larger Dragon forces, but because Draco's forces were the\nones trying to force an engagement, it meant that they had to\nfollow where Chaos ran, and somehow that was\nproducing concentrations of Chaotic force that would fire into the\nexposed sides of Dragon -",
      "It was happening again!",
      "\"Prismatis!\u202f\" shouted Draco, raising his wand, and that\nshield you could see even through the water, a sparkling\nmulticolored flat wall wide enough to shield Draco and the five\nother Dragons with him from the Chaotic force that had just started\nfiring on them as they swam past, and that let the other\nfive Dragons turn their attentions back to the Chaotic\nforce they'd been chasing -",
      "There was a tense moment as sleep spell after sleep spell\ncrashed into Draco's Prismatic Wall, and Draco was hoping to Merlin\nthat none of those four Chaotics had learned the Breaking Drill Hex\n-",
      "Then there was the bell of a Dragon victory, and the Chaotic\nforce spun head-for-foot and began swimming away; and Draco, his\nhands now shaking slightly, dropped the Prismatic Wall and lowered\nhis wand.",
      "Fighting in water was more exhausting even than fighting on\nbroomsticks.",
      "\"Do not pursue!\u202f\" Draco cried to his soldiers as they\nstarted to follow, then, \"Sonorus! REFORM ON ME!\u202f\"",
      "The Dragon forces started converging on Draco, and the Chaotic\nforces spun around and began pursuing the Dragons on the\ninstant - Draco swore out loud as he heard the bell of a Chaotic\nvictory, someone hadn't gotten their Simple Shield oriented right -\nand then the Dragon forces were in supporting range of each other\nand the Chaotics were moving back into the murky distance.",
      "Somehow, despite their numerical superiority, the Dragons had\nscored three times against the Chaotics and the Chaotics had scored\nfour times back, and he'd heard one Dragon spy get executed. Either\nHarry Potter had thought of a lot of very good ideas very fast, or\nfor some unimaginable reason he'd already spent a lot of time\nworking out how to fight underwater. This wasn't working, and Draco\nneeded to rethink things.",
      "It looked like everyone was having trouble aiming while\nswimming, too, the battle might last long enough that time would be\ncalled... the distant underwater moon was only half full now, that\nwasn't good... he had to rethink things fast...",
      "\"What is it?\" said Padma Patil, as she and her force swam over\ntoward Draco.",
      "Padma was his second-in-command; she was clever and powerful,\nand better yet, she hated Granger and saw Harry as a rival, which\nmade her trustworthy. Working with Padma was making him\nrealize the truth of the old adage that Ravenclaw was sister to\nSlytherin; Draco had been surprised when his father had told him it\nwas an acceptable House for his future wife, but now he saw the\nsense of it.",
      "\"Wait until we're all here,\" Draco said. The truth was, he\nneeded to catch his breath. That was the trouble with being the\ngeneral and the most powerful wizard, you had to keep\nusing magic.",
      "Zabini came in next, commanding a force of two Sunnies and four\nDragons, one of whom was Gregory keeping an eye on Zabini. Draco\ndidn't trust Zabini. And neither Draco nor Zabini trusted the\nSunnies enough to make them a majority of any unit; they were\nsupposed to be loyal either to Draco directly, or to\nGranger who'd been fooled by the promise that the Dragons would be\nbetrayed in the end after both forces had been depleted, just as\nHarry's more trusted Chaotics should've been fooled into not\nshooting at the Sunnies by the promise of their firing fake Sleep\nHexes and switching to support Chaos later; but it was possible\nsome of the Sunnies were loyal to Chaos and\nweren't firing real Sleep Hexes and that was why Dragon\nwasn't winning the way their numerical advantage should've let them\nwin...",
      "The next unit that approached was depleted, three soldiers\nholding wands on two other soldiers, who were swimming with empty\nhands.",
      "Draco gritted his teeth. More traitor problems. He needed to\ntalk to Professor Quirrell about having some way to punish\ntraitors at least, conditions like these were unrealistic,\nin real life you tortured your traitors to death.",
      "\"General Malfoy!\" shouted the commander of the problem unit as\nit swam up, a Ravenclaw boy named Terry. \"We don't know what to do\n- Cesi shot Bogdan, but Cesi says Kellah told him that Bogdan shot\nSpecter -\"",
      "\"I didn't!\u202f\" said Kellah.",
      "\"Yes you did!\u202f\" shrieked Cesi. \"General Malfoy,\nshe's the spy, I should've rea-\"",
      "\"Somnium,\" said Draco.",
      "There was the triple bell of a one-point loss from Dragon, and\nthen Kellah's limp body began to float away in the water.",
      "Draco had heard the word 'recursion' by this point, and\nhe knew a Harry Potter plot when he saw one.",
      "(Unfortunately Draco had not heard of autoimmune\ndisorders, and the thought did not readily occur to him\nthat a clever virus would begin its attack by creating symptoms of\nan autoimmune disorder so as to get the body to distrust its own\nimmune system...)",
      "\"General order!\u202f\" said Draco, raising his voice.\n\"Nobody gets to shoot spies except myself, Gregory, Padma, and\nTerry. If anyone sees anything suspicious they come to one of\nus.\"",
      "And then -",
      "There was the bell of Sunshine scoring two points.",
      "\"What?\u202f\" said Draco and Zabini around the same time;\ntheir heads swiveled around. No one seemed to have gotten hit, and\nall the Sunshine soldiers were present and accounted for. (Except\nParvati, who had been shot by some still-unknown traitor in Padma's\nsquad; and of course Padma had shot Parvati again in case she was\nfaking, so it wasn't her...)",
      "\"A Sunny traitor in Chaos?\" said Zabini, sounding puzzled. \"But\nall the ones I knew about were supposed to strike during Chaos's\nattack on Sunshine -\"",
      "\"No!\" said Padma in a tone of sudden realization. \"That was\nChaos executing a spy!\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" said Zabini. \"But why -\"",
      "And Draco got it. Damn it! \"Because Potter thinks he's\nsafe for how much he beats Sunshine, but not for how much he beats\nus! So he doesn't want to lose a single point when he\nexecutes a traitor! General order! If you have to execute\na traitor, call Sunshine first! And don't forget to switch back to\nDragon afterward -\"",
      "Granger: 253 / Malfoy: 252 / Potter: 252",
      "Longbottom's body drifted chaotically through the water, arms\nand legs disarrayed. After Draco had finally got a hit in they'd\nall shot him again just to be sure.",
      "Nearby was Harry Potter, now protected by a Prismatic Sphere,\nlooking at them all grimly as the last sliver of crescent moon\nslowly diminished, somewhere far away. If Longbottom had managed to\nshoot one more soldier (Draco knew Harry was thinking), if the two\nChaotics had managed to hold out just a little longer, they might\nhave won...",
      "After Draco had reformed his forces and struck out again, the\nensuing battle and execution of spies in Sunshine's name had left\nSunshine exactly one point ahead of Dragon and Chaos both. Once\nHarry had started doing it, Draco had been left with no choice but\nto follow suit.",
      "But now they had General Chaos outnumbered three to one, the\nsurvivors of Dragon Army and the last remaining Sunny traitor:\nDraco, and Padma, and Zabini.",
      "And Draco, who was no fool, had ordered Padma to take Zabini's\nwand after Longbottom had shot Gregory and fallen in turn to Draco.\nThe boy had given him an insulted look, told Draco that he owed him\nfor this, and handed it over.",
      "That left Draco and Padma to take down General Chaos.",
      "\"I don't suppose you'd like to surrender?\" said Draco, smiling\nas evilly as any smile he'd ever directed at Harry Potter.",
      "\"Sleep before surrender!\" shouted General Chaos.",
      "\"Just so you know,\" said Draco, \"Zabini doesn't actually\nhave an older sister for you to rescue from Gryffindor\nbullies. But Zabini does have a mother who doesn't approve\nof Muggleborns like Granger, and I wrote her a few notes, and\noffered Zabini a few favors - nothing involving my father, just\nthings I can do in school. And by the way, Zabini's mother\ndoesn't approve of the Boy-Who-Lived, either. Just in case you\nstill thought Zabini was really on your side.\"",
      "Harry's face grew even grimmer.",
      "Draco raised his wand, and began breathing rhythmically,\nbuilding up strength for a Breaking Drill Hex. Granger's Prismatic\nSphere was almost as strong as Draco's now, and Harry's wasn't much\nweaker, where did those two find time?",
      "\"Lagann!\u202f\" spoke Draco, putting everything he had into\nit, and the green spiral blazed out and Harry's shield shattered,\nand at almost the same moment -",
      "\"Somnium!\u202f\" said Padma.",
      "Granger: 253 / Malfoy: 252 / Potter: 254",
      "Harry let out a long breath of relief, and not just because he\ndidn't have to hold the Prismatic Sphere any more. His hand was\nshaking as he lowered his wand.",
      "\"You know,\" said Harry, \"I was pretty worried there for a\nmoment.\"",
      "Special Order Two: If a Sunny traitor doesn't seem to be\nreally shooting at you, fake being hit occasionally. Prefer\ntargeting Dragons to Sunnies but go ahead and shoot Sunnies if you\ncan't shoot Dragons.",
      "Special Order Three: Merlin says do not shoot at Blaise\nZabini or either Patil twin.",
      "With a wide grin, Parvati Patil stripped the Transfigured patch\noff her uniform's insignia, and let it float away in the water.",
      "\"Gryffindors for Chaos,\" she said, and handed Zabini his wand\nback.",
      "\"Thank you very much,\" Harry said, and bowed sweepingly\nto the Gryffindor girl. \"And thank you as well,\" bowing to\nZabini. \"You know, when you came to me with that plan, I wondered\nif you were brilliant or crazy, and I've decided that you're both.\nAnd by the way,\" Harry said, now turning as though to address\nDraco's body, \"Zabini does have a cousin -\"",
      "\"Somnium,\" said Zabini's voice.",
      "Granger: 255 / Malfoy: 252 / Potter: 254",
      "And Harry Potter's body floated away, his expression of shock\nand horror quickly relaxing into sleep.",
      "\"On second thought,\" Parvati said cheerfully, \"make that\nGryffindors for Sunshine.\"",
      "She started to laugh, more exhiliarated than she'd ever been in\nher life, she'd finally gotten to assassinate and replace\nher twin sister and she'd wanted to do that since forever,\nand this had been perfect, it had all been\nperfect -",
      "- and then her wand spun around in a lightning motion just as\nZabini's wand turned to point at her.",
      "\"Wait!\" said Zabini. \"Do not shoot, do not resist. That's an\norder.\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" said Parvati.",
      "\"Sorry,\" said Zabini, looking not-quite-sincerely apologetic,\n\"but I can't be totally sure you're for Sunshine. So I\norder you to let me shoot you.\"",
      "\"Hold on!\u202f\" said Parvati. \"We're only ahead of Chaos by\none point! If you shoot me now -\"",
      "\"I'll shoot you in the name of Dragon, obviously,\" said\nZabini, now sounding a little superior. \"Just because we tricked\nthem into doing it, doesn't mean it won't work for\nus.\"",
      "Parvati stared at him, her eyes narrowing. \"General Malfoy said\nyour mother doesn't like Hermione.\"",
      "\"I suppose,\" said Zabini, still with that superior smirk. \"But\nsome of us are more willing than Draco Malfoy to annoy a\nparent.\"",
      "\"And Harry Potter said you have a cousin -\"",
      "\"Nope,\" said Zabini.",
      "Parvati stared at him, trying to think, but she wasn't really\ngood at plotting; Zabini'd said the plan was to secretly keep the\nscores of Chaos and Dragon as even as possible so they'd use\nSunshine's name to execute their traitors instead of losing even a\nsingle point, and that had worked... but... she had the\nfeeling she was missing something, she wasn't a Slytherin...",
      "\"Why don't I shoot you in the name of Dragon?\"\nsaid Parvati.",
      "\"Because I outrank you,\" said Zabini.",
      "Parvati had a bad feeling about this.",
      "She stared at him for a long moment.",
      "And then -",
      "\"Somni-\" she started to say, and then realized she\nhadn't said for Dragon, and frantically cut herself off\n-",
      "Granger: 255 / Malfoy: 254 / Potter: 254",
      "\"Hey, everyone,\" said Blaise Zabini's face on the screens,\nlooking quite amused, \"guess it's all down to me.\"",
      "All by the lakeside, people were holding their breath.",
      "Sunshine was ahead of Dragon and Chaos by exactly one point.",
      "Blaise Zabini could shoot himself in the name of either Dragon\nor Chaos, or just leave things the way they were.",
      "A series of chimes indicated that the last minute of time was\nrunning out.",
      "And the Slytherin was smiling a strange, twisted smile, and\ncasually toying with his wand, the dark wood barely visible in the\ndark water.",
      "\"You know,\" said Blaise Zabini's voice, in the tones of someone\nwho'd been rehearsing the words for a while, \"it's just a game,\nreally. And games are supposed to be fun. So how about if\nI just do whatever I feel like?\""

      "Minerva and Dumbledore together had applied their combined\ntalent to conjure the grand stage toward which Quirrell now slowly\ntrudged; it was, at its core, sturdy wood, but the outer surfaces\nshone with glitter of marble inlaid with platinum and studded with\ngems of every House color. Neither she nor the Headmaster was any\nFounder of Hogwarts, but the conjuration only needed to last a few\nhours. Minerva ordinarily enjoyed the few occasions when she had\nthe occasion to tire herself out on large Transfigurations; she\nshould have enjoyed the many small chances for artistry, and the\nillusion of opulence; but this time she had done the work with the\ndreadful feeling of digging her own grave.",
      "But Minerva was feeling a little better now. There'd been one\nbrief moment when the explosion might've come; but Dumbledore had\nalready been standing up and applauding warmly, and no one had\nproven foolish enough to riot in front of the Headmaster.",
      "And the explosive mood had rapidly faded into a collective\nsentiment which might perhaps have been described by the phrase:\nGive us a break!",
      "Blaise Zabini had shot himself in the name of Sunshine, and the\nfinal score had been 254 to 254 to 254.",
      "Behind the stage, waiting to ascend, three children were glaring\nat each other in mingled fury and frustration. It didn't help that\nthey were still damp from being fished out of the lake, and that\nthe Warming Charms didn't seem quite enough to make up for the\ncrisp December air, or maybe it was just their mood.",
      "\"That's it,\" said Granger. \"I've had it! No\nmore traitors!\"",
      "\"I completely agree with you, Miss Granger,\" Draco said icily.\n\"Enough is enough.\"",
      "\"And what do you two intend to do about it?\" snapped\nHarry Potter. \"Professor Quirrell already said he wouldn't ban\nspies!\"",
      "\"We'll ban them for him,\" said Draco grimly. He hadn't\neven understood what he meant by the words as he said them, but the\nvery act of speaking seemed to crystallize a plan -",
      "The stage really was well done, at least for a temporary\nstructure; the makers hadn't fallen into the usual pitfall of being\nimpressed by their own illusion of wealth, and knew something about\narchitecture and visual style. From where Draco stood, in the\nobvious place for him to stand, the watching students would see him\nhaloed in the faint glitter of emeralds; and Granger, standing\nwhere Draco had subtly motioned her, would be haloed in Ravenclaw's\nsapphire. As for Harry Potter, Draco wasn't looking at him right\nnow.",
      "Professor Quirrell had... awakened, or whatever it was he did;\nand was leaning upon a platinum podium bare of all gems. With\nevident showmanship, the Defense Professor was carefully stacking\nand squaring those three envelopes containing the three parchments\nupon which the three generals had written their wishes, as all the\nstudents of Hogwarts watched, and waited.",
      "Finally Professor Quirrell looked up from the envelopes. \"Well,\"\nsaid the Defense Professor. \"This is inconvenient.\"",
      "A slight titter of laughter ran through the crowd, with a sharp\nundertone.",
      "\"I suppose you are all wondering what I will do?\" said Professor\nQuirrell. \"There is nothing for it; I shall have to do what is\nfair. Although first there was a little speech I wanted to make,\nand before even that, it appears to me that Mr. Malfoy and Miss\nGranger have something they wish to share.\"",
      "Draco blinked, and then he and Granger traded rapid glances -\nmay I? - yes, go ahead - and Draco raised his\nvoice.",
      "\"General Granger and I would both like to say,\" Draco said in\nhis most formal voice, knowing it was being amplified and heard,\n\"that we will no longer accept the help of any traitors. And if, in\nany battle, we find that Potter has accepted traitors from either\nof our armies, we will join forces to crush him.\"",
      "And Draco shot a glance filled at malice at the Boy-Who-Lived.\nTake that, General Chaos!",
      "\"I agree completely with General Malfoy,\" said Granger standing\nbeside him, her high voice clear and strong. \"Neither of us will\nuse traitors, and if General Potter does, we will wipe him off the\nbattlefield.\"",
      "There was a susurration of surprise from the watching\nstudents.",
      "\"Very good,\" said their Defense Professor, smiling. \"It took the\ntwo of you long enough, but you are still to be congratulated on\nhaving thought of it before any other generals.\"",
      "It took a moment for this to soak in -",
      "\"In the future, Mr. Malfoy, Miss Granger, before you come to my\noffice with any request, consider whether there is a way for you to\naccomplish it without my help. I will not deduct Quirrell points on\nthis occasion, but next time you may expect to lose the full\nfifty.\" Professor Quirrell wore an amused grin. \"And what do you\nhave to say about that, Mr. Potter?\"",
      "Harry Potter's gaze went to Granger, then to Draco. His face\nappeared calm; though Draco was sure controlled would have\nbeen the better term.",
      "Finally Harry Potter spoke, his voice level. \"The Chaos Legion\nis still happy to accept traitors. See you on the battlefield.\"",
      "Draco knew the shock was showing on his own face; there were\nastonished murmurs from the watching students, and when Draco\nglanced at the front row he saw that even Harry's Chaotics looked\ntaken aback.",
      "Granger's face was angry, and getting angrier. \"Mr. Potter,\" she\nsaid in a sharp tone like she thought she was a teacher, \"are you\ntrying to be obnoxious?\"",
      "\"Most certainly not,\" Harry Potter said calmly. \"I won't make\nyou do it every time. Beat me once, and I'll stay beaten. But\nthreats aren't always enough, General of Sunshine. You did not ask\nme to join with you, but tried simply to impose your will; and\nsometimes you must actually defeat the enemy, to impose your will\non him. You see, I am skeptical that Hermione Granger, the\nbrightest academic star of Hogwarts, and Draco, son of Lucius,\nscion of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy, can work\ntogether to beat their common foe, Harry Potter.\" An amused smile\ncrossed Harry Potter's face. \"Maybe I'll just do what Draco tried\nwith Zabini, and write a letter to Lucius Malfoy and see what\nhe thinks about that.\"",
      "\"Harry!\u202f\" gasped Granger, looking absolutely aghast,\nand there were gasps from the audience as well.",
      "Draco controlled the anger flushing through him. That had been a\nstupid move on Harry's part, saying that in public. If\nHarry had simply done it, it might have worked, Draco\nhadn't even thought about that, but now if Father did that\nit would look like he was playing into Harry's hands -",
      "\"If you think my father, Lord Malfoy, can be manipulated by\nyou that easily,\" Draco said coldly, \"you have a surprise\ncoming, Harry Potter.\"",
      "And Draco realized as the words finished leaving his mouth that\nhe'd just backed his own father squarely into the corner,\nmore or less without even meaning to. Father probably\nwasn't going to like this, not the tiniest bit, but now it\nwould be impossible for him to say so... Draco would have to\napologize for that, it had been an honest accident, but it\nwas strange to think that he'd done it at all.",
      "\"Then go ahead and defeat the evil General Chaos,\" Harry said,\nstill looking amused. \"I can't win against both your armies - not\nif you really work together. But I wonder if perhaps I\ncould break you up before then.\"",
      "\"You won't, and we'll crush you!\" said Draco\nMalfoy.",
      "And beside him, Hermione Granger firmly nodded.",
      "\"Well,\" said Professor Quirrell after the astounded silence had\nstretched for a while. \"That was not how I expected that\nparticular conversation to go.\" The Defense Professor had a rather\nintrigued expression on his face. \"Truthfully, Mr. Potter, I\nexpected you to concede immediately and with a smile, then announce\nthat you had long since worked out my intended lesson but had\ndecided not to spoil it for others. Indeed, I planned my speech\naccordingly, Mr. Potter.\"",
      "Harry Potter just shrugged. \"Sorry about that,\" he said, and\nsaid nothing more.",
      "\"Oh, don't worry,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"This, too, will\nserve.\"",
      "And Professor Quirrell turned from the three children, and\nstraightened at the podium to address the whole watching crowd; his\ncustomary air of detached amusement dropped away like a falling\nmask, and when he spoke again his voice was amplified louder than\nit had been.",
      "\"If not for Harry Potter,\" said Professor Quirrell, his voice as\ncrisp and cold as December, \"You-Know-Who would have won.\"",
      "The silence was instant, and total.",
      "\"Make no mistake,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"The Dark Lord\nwas winning. There were fewer and fewer Aurors who dared\nface him, the vigilantes who opposed him were being hunted down.\nOne Dark Lord and perhaps fifty Death Eaters were winning\nagainst a country of thousands. That is beyond ridiculous! There\nare no grades low enough for me to mark that incompetence!\"",
      "There was a frown on the face of Headmaster Dumbledore; and on\nthe faces of the audience, puzzlement; and the utter silence went\non.",
      "\"Do you understand now how it happened? You saw it today. I\nallowed traitors, and gave the generals no means to restrain them.\nYou saw the result. Clever plots and clever betrayals, until the\nlast soldier left on the battlefield shot himself! You cannot\npossibly doubt that all three of those armies could have\nbeen defeated by any outside foe that was unified within\nitself.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell leaned forward at the podium, his voice now\nfilled with a grim intensity. His right hand stretched out, fingers\nopen and spread. \"Division is weakness,\" said the Defense\nProfessor. His hand closed into a tight fist. \"Unity is strength.\nThe Dark Lord understood that well, whatever his other follies; and\nhe used that understanding to create the one simple\ninvention that made him the most terrible Dark Lord in history.\nYour parents faced one Dark Lord. And fifty Death Eaters who were\nperfectly unified, knowing that any breach of their loyalty would\nbe punished by death, that any slack or incompetence would be\npunished by pain. None could escape the Dark Lord's grasp once they\ntook his Mark. And the Death Eaters agreed to take that terrible\nMark because they knew that once they took it, they would be\nunited, facing a divided land. One Dark Lord and fifty\nDeath Eaters would have defeated an entire country, by the power of\nthe Dark Mark.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell's voice was bleak and hard. \"Your parents\ncould have fought back in kind. They did not. There was a\nman named Yermy Wibble who called upon the nation to institute a\ndraft, though he did not quite have vision enough to propose a Mark\nof Britain. Yermy Wibble knew what would happen to him; he hoped\nhis death would inspire others. So the Dark Lord took his family\nfor good measure. Their empty skins inspired nothing but fear, and\nno one dared to speak again. And your parents would have faced the\nconsequences of their despicable cowardice, if not for being saved\nby a one-year-old boy.\" Professor Quirrell's face showed full\ncontempt. \"A dramatist would have called that a dei ex\nmachina, for they did nothing to earn their salvation.\nHe-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named may not have deserved to win, but make no\ndoubt of it, your parents deserved to lose.\"",
      "The voice of the Defense Professor rang forth like iron. \"And\nknow this: your parents have learned nothing! The nation is still\nfragmented and weak! How few decades passed between Grindelwald and\nYou-Know-Who? Do you think you will not see the next\nthreat in your own lifetimes? Will you repeat then the\nfollies of your parents, when you have seen the results so clearly\nlaid out before you this day? For I can tell you what your parents\nwill do, when the day of darkness comes! I can tell you what lesson\nthey have learned! They have learned to hide like cowards and do\nnothing while they wait for Harry Potter to save them!\"",
      "There was a wondering look in the eyes of Headmaster Dumbledore;\nand other students gazed up at their Defense Professor with\nbewilderment and anger and awe.",
      "Professor Quirrell's eyes were as cold now as his voice. \"Mark\nthis, and mark it well. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named wished to rule\nover this country, to hold it in his cruel grasp forever. But at\nleast he wished to rule over a living country, and not a\nheap of ash! There have been Dark Lords who were mad, who wished\nonly to make the world a vast funeral pyre! There have been wars in\nwhich one whole country marched against another! Your parents\nnearly lost against half a hundred, who thought to take this\ncountry alive! How quickly would they have been crushed by a foe\nmore numerous than they, a foe that cared for nothing but their\ndestruction? This I foretell: When the next threat rises, Lucius\nMalfoy will claim that you must follow him or perish, that your\nonly hope is to trust in his cruelty and strength. And though\nLucius Malfoy himself will believe it, this will be a lie. For when\nthe Dark Lord perished, Lucius Malfoy did not unite the Death\nEaters, they were shattered in an instant, they fled like whipped\ndogs and betrayed each other! Lucius Malfoy is not strong enough to\nbe a true Lord, Dark or otherwise.\"",
      "Draco Malfoy's fists were clenched white, there were tears in\nhis eyes, and fury, and unbearable shame.",
      "\"No,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"I do not think it will be Lucius\nMalfoy who saves you. And lest you think that I speak on my own\nbehalf, time will make clear soon enough that this is not so. I\nmake you no recommendation, my students. But I say that if a whole\ncountry were to find a leader as strong as the Dark Lord, but\nhonorable and pure, and take his Mark; then they could crush any\nDark Lord like an insect, and all the rest of our divided magical\nworld could not threaten them. And if some still greater enemy rose\nagainst us in a war of extermination, then only a united magical\nworld could survive.\"",
      "There were gasps, mostly from Muggleborns; the students in\ngreen-trimmed robes looked merely puzzled. Now it was Harry Potter\nwhose fists were clenched tight and trembling; and Hermione Granger\nbeside him was angry and dismayed.",
      "The Headmaster rose from his seat, his face now stern, saying no\nword as yet; but the command was clear.",
      "\"I do not say what threat will come,\" said Professor\nQuirrell. \"But you will not live all your lives in peace, not if\nthe past history of the world is any guide at all to its future.\nAnd if you do in the future as you have seen three armies do this\nday, if you cannot throw aside your petty bickering and take the\nMark of a single leader, then indeed you might wish that the Dark\nLord had lived to rule over you, and regret the day that ever Harry\nPotter was born -\"",
      "\"Enough!\u202f\" bellowed Albus Dumbledore.",
      "There was silence.",
      "Professor Quirrell slowly turned his head to gaze at where Albus\nDumbledore stood in the fury of his wizardry; their eyes met, and a\nsoundless stress pressed down like weight upon all the students, as\nthey listened not daring to move.",
      "\"You, too, failed this country,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"And\nyou know the peril as well as I.\"",
      "\"Such speeches are not for the ears of students,\" said Albus\nDumbledore in a dangerously rising voice. \"Nor for the mouths of\nprofessors!\"",
      "Dryly, then, Professor Quirrell spoke: \"There were many speeches\nmade for the ears of adults, as the Dark Lord rose. And the adults\nclapped and cheered, and went home having enjoyed their day's\nentertainment. But I will obey you, Headmaster, and make no further\nspeeches if you do not like them. My lesson is simple. I will go on\ndoing nothing about traitors, and we will see what students can do\nfor themselves about that, when they do not wait for professors to\nsave them.\"",
      "And then Professor Quirrell turned back to his students, and his\nmouth quirked up in a wry grin that seemed to dissipate the\ndreadful pressure like a god blowing to scatter the clouds. \"But do\nplease be kind to the traitors up until now,\" said Professor\nQuirrell. \"They were just having fun.\"",
      "There was laughter, though it was nervous at first, and then it\nseemed to build, as Professor Quirrell stood there smiling wryly\nand some of the tension released itself.",
      "Draco's mind was still whirling through a thousand questions and\na daze of horror, as Professor Quirrell prepared to open the\nenvelopes in which the three had inscribed their wishes.",
      "It had never before occurred to Draco that moon-traveling\nMuggles were a greater threat than the slow decline of wizardry, or\nthat Father had proven himself too weak to stop them.",
      "And even stranger, the obvious implication: Professor Quirrell\nbelieved that Harry could. The Defense Professor claimed\nto have made no recommendation, but he'd mentioned Harry Potter\nover and over in his speech; others would already be thinking the\nsame thing as Draco.",
      "It was ridiculous. The boy who had covered a stuffed chair in\nglitter and called it a throne -",
      "The boy who faced down Snape and won, whispered a\ntraitorous voice, that boy could grow into a Lord strong enough\nto rule, strong enough to save us all -",
      "Harry had been raised by Muggles! He was practically a\nmudblood himself, he wouldn't fight against his adopted family\n-",
      "He knows their arts, their secrets and their methods; he can\ntake all of the Muggles' science and use it against them, alongside\nour own power as wizards.",
      "But what if he refuses? What if he's too weak?",
      "Then, said that inner voice, it will have to be\nyou, won't it, Draco Malfoy?",
      "And then there was a renewed hush from the crowd, as Professor\nQuirrell opened the first envelope.",
      "\"Mr. Malfoy,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"your wish is for...\nSlytherin to win the House Cup.\"",
      "There was a puzzled pause from the watching audience.",
      "\"Yes, Professor,\" said Draco in a clear voice, knowing that it\nwas once again being amplified. \"If you can't do that, then\nsomething else for Slytherin -\"",
      "\"I will not award House points unfairly,\" said Professor\nQuirrell. He tapped a cheek, looking thoughtful. \"Which makes your\nwish difficult enough to be interesting. Would you like to say\nanything about why, Mr. Malfoy?\"",
      "Draco turned from the Defense Professor, gazed out at the crowd\nfrom against that backdrop of platinum and emeralds. Not all of\nSlytherin had cheered for Dragon Army, there were anti-Malfoy\nfactions who had expressed that dissatisfaction by supporting the\nBoy-Who-Lived, or even Granger; and those factions would be\nencouraged greatly by what Zabini had done. He needed to remind\nthem that Slytherin meant Malfoy and Malfoy meant Slytherin -",
      "\"No,\" said Draco. \"They're Slytherins, they'll understand.\"",
      "There was some laughter from the audience, especially in\nSlytherin, even from some students who would have called themselves\nanti-Malfoy a moment earlier.",
      "Flattery was a lovely thing.",
      "Draco turned back to look at Professor Quirrell again, and was\nsurprised to see an embarrassed look on Granger's face.",
      "\"And for Miss Granger...\" said Professor Quirrell. There was the\nsound of a tearing envelope. \"Your wish is for... Ravenclaw to win\nthe House Cup?\"",
      "There was considerable laughter from the audience, including a\nchuckle from Draco. He hadn't thought Granger played that game.",
      "\"Well, um,\" said Granger, sounding like she was suddenly\nstumbling over a memorized speech, \"I meant to say, that...\" She\ntook a deep breath. \"There were soldiers from every House in my\narmy, and I don't mean to slight any of them. But Houses should\nstill count for something, too. It was sad when students in the\nsame House were hexing each other just because they were in\ndifferent armies. People should be able to rely on whoever's in\ntheir House. That's why Godric Gryffindor, and Salazar Slytherin,\nand Rowena Ravenclaw, and Helga Hufflepuff created the four Houses\nof Hogwarts in the first place. I'm the General of Sunshine, but\neven before that, I'm Hermione Granger of Ravenclaw, and I'm proud\nto be part of a House that's eight hundred years old.\"",
      "\"Well said, Miss Granger!\" said Dumbledore's booming voice.",
      "Harry Potter was frowning, and something tickled at the edge of\nDraco's recognition.",
      "\"An interesting sentiment, Miss Granger,\" said Professor\nQuirrell. \"But there are times when it is good for a Slytherin to\nhave friends in Ravenclaw, or for a Gryffindor to have friends in\nHufflepuff. Surely it would be best if you could rely both on your\nfriends in your House, and also your friends in your army?\"",
      "Granger's eyes flicked briefly toward the watching students and\nteachers, and she said nothing.",
      "Professor Quirrell nodded as though to himself, and then turned\nback to the podium, and took up and tore open the last envelope.\nBeside Draco, Harry Potter visibly tensed up as the Defense\nProfessor drew forth the parchment. \"And Mr. Potter wishes for\n-\"",
      "There was a pause as Professor Quirrell looked at the\nparchment.",
      "Then, without any change of expression on Professor Quirrell's\nface, the sheet of parchment burst into flames, and burned with a\nbrief, intense fire that left only drifting black dust sprinkling\ndown from his hand.",
      "\"Please confine yourself to the possible, Mr. Potter,\" said\nProfessor Quirrell, sounding very dry indeed.",
      "There was a long pause; Harry, standing beside Draco, looked\nrather shaken.",
      "What in Merlin's name did he ask for?",
      "\"I do hope,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"that you prepared another\nwish, if I could not grant that one.\"",
      "There was another pause.",
      "Harry drew a deep breath. \"I didn't,\" he said, \"but I already\nthought of another one.\" Harry Potter turned to look out at the\naudience, and his voice firmed as he spoke. \"People fear traitors\nbecause of the damage the traitor does directly, the soldiers they\nshoot or the secrets they tell. But that's only part of the danger.\nWhat people do because they're afraid of traitors also\ncosts them. I used that strategy today against Sunshine and Dragon.\nI didn't tell my traitors to cause as much direct damage as\npossible. I told them to act in the way that would create the most\ndistrust and confusion, and make the generals do the most costly\nthings to try and stop them from doing it again. When there are\njust a few traitors and a whole country opposing them, it stands to\nreason that what a few traitors do might be less damaging than what\na whole country does to stop them, that the cure might be worse\nthan the disease -\"",
      "\"Mr. Potter,\" said the Defense Professor, his voice suddenly\ncutting, \"the lesson of history is that you are simply wrong. Your\nparents' generation did too little to unify themselves, not too\nmuch! This whole country almost fell, Mr. Potter, though you were\nnot there to see it. I suggest that you ask your dorm-mates in\nRavenclaw how many of them have lost family to the Dark Lord. Or if\nyou are wiser, do not ask! Do you have a wish to\nmake, Mr. Potter?\"",
      "\"If you don't mind,\" said the mild voice of Albus Dumbledore, \"I\nshould like to hear what the Boy-Who-Lived has to say. He has more\nexperience than either of us at stopping wars.\"",
      "A few people laughed, but not many.",
      "Harry Potter's gaze moved to Dumbledore, and he looked\nconsidering for a moment. \"I'm not saying you're wrong, Professor\nQuirrell. In the last war, people didn't act together, and a whole\ncountry almost fell to a few dozen attackers, and yes, that was\npathetic. And if we make the same mistake next time, yes, that'll\nbe even more pathetic. But you never fight the same war twice. And\nthe problem is, the enemy is also allowed to be smart. If\nyou're divided you're vulnerable in one way; but when you try to\nunite, then you face other risks, and other costs, and the enemy\nwill try to take advantage of those, too. You can't stop thinking\nat just one level of the game.\"",
      "\"Simplicity also has a great deal to commend it, Mr. Potter,\"\nsaid the dry voice of the Defense Professor. \"I do hope that you\nhave learned something this day about the dangers of strategies\nmore complicated than uniting your people and attacking your enemy.\nAnd if all this does not tie into your wish somehow, I shall be\nquite annoyed.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harry Potter, \"it was pretty difficult coming up\nwith a wish to symbolize the costs of unity. But the problem of\nacting together isn't just for wars, it's something we have to\nsolve all our lives, every day. If everyone is coordinating using\nthe same rules, and the rules are stupid, then if one\nperson decides to do things differently, they're breaking the\nrules. But if everyone decides to do things differently,\nthey can. It's exactly the same problem of everyone needing to act\ntogether. But for the first person who speaks out, it\nseems like they're going against the crowd. And if you thought that\nthe only important thing was that people should always be unified,\nthen you could never change the game, no matter how stupid the\nrules. So my own wish, to symbolize what happens when people unite\nin the wrong direction, is that in Hogwarts we should play\nQuidditch without the Snitch.\"",
      "\"WHAT?\u202f\" screamed a hundred voices in the crowd, as\nDraco's jaw dropped.",
      "\"The Snitch ruins the whole game,\" said Harry Potter.\n\"Everything the other players do ends up being irrelevant. It would\nmake overwhelmingly more sense to just buy a clock. It's one of\nthose incredibly stupid things you don't notice just because you\ngrew up with it, that people only do because everyone else is doing\nit -\"",
      "But by that point Harry Potter's voice could no longer be heard,\nbecause the riot had started.",
      "The riot ended around fifteen seconds later, after a gigantic\nspout of fire blasted out of the highest tower of Hogwarts to the\nsound of a hundred thunders. Draco hadn't known Dumbledore could\ndo that.",
      "The students sat down again very carefully and quietly.",
      "Professor Quirrell was laughing, without pause. \"So be it, Mr.\nPotter. Your will be done.\" The Defense Professor paused\ndeliberately. \"Of course, I only promised one cunning\nplot. And that is all that the three of you will get.\"",
      "Draco had been half-expecting the words earlier, but now they\nstill came as a shock; Draco exchanged rapid glances with Granger,\nthey would have been the obvious allies but their wishes were\ndirectly opposed -",
      "\"You mean,\" said Harry, \"we have to all agree on a wish?\"",
      "\"Oh, that would be far too much to ask,\" said Professor\nQuirrell. \"The three of you have no common enemy, do you?\"",
      "And for one brief moment, so fast that Draco thought he might\nhave imagined it, the Defense Professor's eyes flicked in the\ndirection of Dumbledore.",
      "\"No,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"I mean that I shall grant three\nwishes using a single plot.\"",
      "There was a confused silence.",
      "\"You can't do that,\" Harry said flatly from beside Draco. \"Not\neven I can do that. Two of those wishes are mutually\nincompatible. It's logically impossible -\" and then Harry\ncut himself off.",
      "\"You're a few years too young to tell me what I can't do, Mr.\nPotter,\" said Professor Quirrell, with a brief dry smile.",
      "Then the Defense Professor turned back to the watching students.\n\"Truthfully, I have no confidence in your ability to learn this\nday's lesson. Go home, and enjoy your time with your families, or\nwhat's left of them, while they still live. My own family is long\nsince dead at the Dark Lord's hand. I shall see you all when\nclasses resume.\"",
      "In the speechless silence that resulted, Professor Quirrell\nalready turning to walk off the stage, Draco heard the Defense\nProfessor's voice say, quietly and no longer amplified, \"But you,\nMr. Potter, I would speak to now.\""

      "They had gone to the Defense Professor's office, and Professor\nQuirrell had sealed the door before he leaned back in his chair and\nspoke.",
      "The Defense Professor's voice was very calm, and that unnerved\nHarry a good deal more than if Professor Quirrell had been\nshouting.",
      "\"I am trying,\" said Professor Quirrell quietly, \"to make\nallowances for the fact that you are young. That I myself, at the\nsame age, was a quite extraordinary fool. You speak with adult\nstyle and meddle in adult games, and sometimes I forget that you\nare only a meddler. I hope, Mr. Potter, that your childish meddling\nhas not just killed you, ruined your country, and lost the next\nwar.\"",
      "It was very hard for Harry to control his breathing. \"Professor\nQuirrell, I said a good deal less than I wished to say, but I had\nto say something. Your proposals are extremely alarming to anyone\nwho has the slightest familiarity with Muggle history over the last\ncentury. The Italian fascists, some very nasty people, got their\nname from the fasces, a bundle of rods bound together to\nsymbolize the idea that unity is strength -\"",
      "\"So the nasty Italian fascists believed that unity is stronger\nthan division,\" said Professor Quirrell. Sharpness was beginning to\ncreep into his voice. \"Perhaps they also believed that the sky is\nblue, and advocated a policy of not dropping rocks on your\nhead.\"",
      "Reversed stupidity is not intelligence; the world's\nstupidest person may say the sun is shining, but that doesn't make\nit dark out... \"Fine, you're right, that was an ad hominem\nargument, it's not wrong because the fascists said it. But\nProfessor Quirrell, you can't have everyone in a country take the\nMark of one dictator! It's a single point of failure! Look, I'll\nput it this way. Suppose the enemy just Imperiuses whoever controls\nthe Mark -\"",
      "\"Powerful wizards are not so easy to Imperius,\" said Professor\nQuirrell dryly. \"And if you cannot find a worthy leader, you are in\nany case doomed. But worthy leaders do exist; the question is\nwhether the people shall follow them.\"",
      "Harry raked his hands through his hair in frustration. He wanted\nto call a time-out and make Professor Quirrell read The Rise\nand Fall of the Third Reich and then start the conversation\nover again. \"I don't suppose that if I suggested democracy was a\nbetter form of government than dictatorship -\"",
      "\"I see,\" said Professor Quirrell. His eyes closed briefly, then\nopened. \"Mr. Potter, the stupidity of Quidditch is transparent to\nyou because you did not grow up revering the game. If you had never\nheard of elections, Mr. Potter, and you simply saw what is\nthere, what you saw would not please you. Look to our elected\nMinister of Magic. Is he the wisest, the strongest, the greatest of\nour nation? No; he is a buffoon who is owned in fee simple by\nLucius Malfoy. Wizards went to the polls and chose between\nCornelius Fudge and Tania Leach, who had competed with each other\nin a grand and entertaining contest after the Daily\nProphet, which Lucius Malfoy also controls, decided that they\nwere the only serious candidates. That Cornelius Fudge was\ngenuinely selected as the best leader our country could offer is\nnot a suggestion anyone could make with a straight face. It is no\ndifferent in the Muggle world, from what I have heard and seen; the\nlast Muggle newspaper I read mentioned that the previous President\nof the United States had been a retired movie actor. If you had not\ngrown up with elections, Mr. Potter, they would be as transparently\nsilly to you as Quidditch.\"",
      "Harry sat there with his mouth open, struggling for words. \"The\npoint of elections isn't to produce the one best leader, it's to\nkeep politicians scared enough of the voters that they don't go\ncompletely evil like dictators do -\"",
      "\"The last war, Mr. Potter, was fought between the Dark Lord and\nDumbledore. And while Dumbledore was a flawed leader who was losing\nthe war, it is ridiculous to suggest that any of\nthe Ministers of Magic elected during that period could have taken\nDumbledore's place! Strength flows from powerful wizards and their\nfollowers, not from elections and the fools they elect. That is the\nlesson of magical Britain's recent history; and I doubt that the\nnext war will teach you a lesson any different. If you\nsurvive it, Mr. Potter, which you will not do unless you\nabandon the enthusiastic illusions of childhood!\"",
      "\"If you think there are no dangers in the course of action you\nadvocate,\" said Harry, and despite everything his voice was growing\nsharp, \"then that, too, is childish enthusiasm.\"",
      "Harry stared grimly into Professor Quirrell's eyes, who stared\nback without blinking.",
      "\"Such dangers,\" said Professor Quirrell coldly, \"are to be\ndiscussed in offices like this one, not in speeches. The fools who\nelected Cornelius Fudge are not interested in complications and\ncaution. Present them with anything more nuanced than a rousing\ncheer, and you will face your war alone. That, Mr. Potter,\nwas your childish error, which Draco Malfoy would not have made\neven when he was eight years old. It should have been obvious even\nto you that you should have stayed silent, and\nconsulted with me first, not spoken your worries before\nthe crowd!\"",
      "\"I am no friend of Albus Dumbledore,\" said Harry, a cold in his\nvoice to match Professor Quirrell's. \"But he is no child, and he\ndid not seem to think my concerns were childish, nor that I should\nhave waited to speak them.\"",
      "\"Oh,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"so you take your cues from the\nHeadmaster now, do you?\" and stood up from behind his desk.",
      "When Blaise turned the corner on the way to the office, he saw\nthat Professor Quirrell was already leaning against the wall.",
      "\"Blaise Zabini,\" said the Defense Professor, straightening; his\neyes were set like dark stones within his face, and his voice sent\na shiver of fear down Blaise's spine.",
      "He can't do anything against me, I just have to remember\nthat -",
      "\"I believe,\" said Professor Quirrell, in a clear, cold voice,\n\"that I have already guessed the name of your employer. But I would\nhear it from your own lips, and tell me also the price that bought\nyou.\"",
      "Blaise knew he was sweating under his robes, and that the\nmoisture would be already visible on his forehead. \"I got a chance\nto show I was better than all three generals, and I took it. A lot\nof people hate me now, but there're also plenty of Slytherins\nwho'll love me for it. What makes you think I'm -\"",
      "\"You did not devise the plan of today's battle, Mr. Zabini. Tell\nme who did.\"",
      "Blaise swallowed hard. \"Well... I mean, in that case... then you\nalready know who did, right? The only one who's that crazy is\nDumbledore. And he'll protect me if you try to do anything.\"",
      "\"Indeed. Tell me the price.\" The Defense Professor's eyes were\nstill hard.",
      "\"It's my cousin Kimberly,\" Blaise said, swallowing again and\ntrying to control his voice. \"She's real, and she's really being\nbullied, Potter checked that, he wasn't dumb. Only Dumbledore said\nthat he'd nudged the bullies into doing it, just for the plan, and\nif I worked for him she'd be fine afterward, but if I\ndid go with Potter, there was more trouble Kimberly could\nget into!\"",
      "Professor Quirrell was silent for a long moment.",
      "\"I see,\" Professor Quirrell said, his voice now much milder.\n\"Mr. Zabini, should such an event occur again, you may contact me\ndirectly. I have my own ways of protecting my friends. Now, a final\nquestion: Even with all the power you took into your hands, forcing\na tie would have been difficult. Did Dumbledore instruct you as to\nwho should win otherwise?\"",
      "\"Sunshine,\" said Blaise.",
      "Professor Quirrell nodded. \"As I thought.\" The Defense Professor\nsighed. \"In your future career, Mr. Zabini, I do not suggest trying\nany plots that complicated. They have a tendency to fail.\"",
      "\"Um, I said that to the Headmaster, actually,\" Blaise said, \"and\nhe said that was why it was important to have more than one plot\ngoing at a time.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell passed a weary hand across his forehead.\n\"It's a wonder the Dark Lord didn't go mad from fighting\nhim. You may go on to your meeting with the Headmaster,\nMr. Zabini. I will say nothing of this, but if the Headmaster\nshould somehow discover that we have spoken, remember my standing\noffer to give you what protection I can. You are dismissed.\"",
      "Blaise didn't wait for any other word, just turned and fled.",
      "Professor Quirrell waited for a time, and then said, \"Go ahead,\nMr. Potter.\"",
      "Harry tore the Cloak of Invisibility off his head and stuffed\ninto his pouch. He was trembing with so much rage he could hardly\nspeak. \"He what? He did what?\u202f\"",
      "\"You should have deduced it yourself, Mr. Potter,\" Professor\nQuirrell said mildly. \"You must learn to blur your vision until you\ncan see the forest obscured by the trees. Anyone who heard the\nstories about you, and who did not know that you were the\nmysterious Boy-Who-Lived, could easily deduce your ownership of an\ninvisibility cloak. Step back from these events, blur away their\ndetails, and what do we observe? There was a great rivalry between\nstudents, and their competition ended in a perfect tie. That sort\nof thing only happens in stories, Mr. Potter, and there is one\nperson in this school who thinks in stories. There was a strange\nand complicated plot, which you should have realized was\nuncharacteristic of the young Slytherin you faced. But there is a\nperson in this school who deals in plots that elaborate, and his\nname is not Zabini. And I did warn you that there was a quadruple\nagent; you knew that Zabini was at least a triple agent, and you\nshould have guessed a high chance that it was he. No, I will not\ndeclare the battle invalid. All three of you failed the test, and\nlost to your common enemy.\"",
      "Harry didn't care about tests at this point. \"Dumbledore\nblackmailed Zabini by threatening his cousin?\nJust to make our battle end in a tie? Why?\u202f\"",
      "Professor Quirrell gave a mirthless laugh. \"Perhaps the\nHeadmaster thought the rivalry was good for his pet hero and wished\nto see it continue. For the greater good, you understand. Or\nperhaps he was simply mad. You see, Mr. Potter, everyone knows that\nDumbledore's madness is a mask, that he is sane pretending to be\ninsane. They pride themselves on that clever insight, and knowing\nthe secret explanation, they stop looking. It does not occur to\nthem that it is also possible to have a mask behind the\nmask, to be insane pretending to be sane pretending to be insane.\nAnd I am afraid, Mr. Potter, that I have urgent business elsewhere,\nand must depart; but I should strongly advise you not to take your\ncues from Albus Dumbledore when fighting a war. Until later, Mr.\nPotter.\"",
      "And the Defense Professor inclined his head with some irony, and\nthen strode off in the same direction Zabini had fled, while Harry\nwas still standing in open-mouthed shock.",
      "Aftermath: Harry Potter.",
      "Harry trudged slowly toward the Ravenclaw dorm, eyes unseeing of\nwalls, paintings, or other students; he went up stairs and down\nramps without slowing, speeding, or noticing where he trod.",
      "It had taken him more than a minute after Professor Quirrell's\ndeparture to realize that his only source of information about\nDumbledore being involved was (a) Blaise Zabini, who he would have\nto be an absolute gaping idiot to trust again, and (b) Professor\nQuirrell, who could have easily faked a plot in Dumbledore's style,\nand who might also think that a little student rivalry was a fine\nthing; and who had, if you stepped back and blurred out the\ndetails, just proposed turning the country into a magical\ndictatorship.",
      "And it was also possible that Dumbledore was the one\nbehind Zabini, and that Professor Quirrell had been sincerely\ntrying to fight the Dark Mark in kind, and prevent the repetition\nof a performance he saw as pathetic. Trying to make sure that Harry\ndidn't end up fighting the Dark Lord alone, while everyone else\nhid, frightened, trying to stay out of the line of fire, waiting\nfor Harry to save them.",
      "But the truth was...",
      "Well...",
      "Harry was sort of okay with that.",
      "It was, he knew, the kind of thing that was supposed to make\nheroes resentful and bitter.",
      "To heck with that. Harry was very much in favor of everyone else\nstaying out of danger while the Boy-Who-Lived took down\nthe Dark Lord by himself, plus or minus a small number of\ncompanions. If the next conflict with the Dark Lord got to the\npoint of a Second Wizarding War that killed lots of people and\nembroiled a whole country, that would mean Harry had already\nfailed.",
      "And if afterward a war broke out between wizards and Muggles, it\ndidn't matter who won, Harry would have already failed by letting\nit get that far. Besides, who said the societies couldn't\npeacefully integrate when the secrecy inevitably broke down?\n(Though Harry could hear Professor Quirrell's dry voice in his\nmind, asking him if he was a fool, and saying all the obvious\nthings...) And if mages and Muggles couldn't live in peace, then\nHarry would combine magic and science and figure out how to\nevacuate all the wizards to Mars or somewhere, instead of letting a\nwar break out.",
      "Because if it did come down to a war of extermination...",
      "That was the thing Professor Quirrell hadn't realized, the one\nmost important question he'd forgotten to ask his young\ngeneral.",
      "The real reason why Harry had no intention of being argued into\nendorsing a Light Mark, no matter how much it would help\nhim in his fight against the Dark Lord.",
      "One Dark Lord and fifty Marked followers had been a peril to all\nof magical Britain.",
      "If all Britain took the Mark of a strong leader, they would be a\nperil to the whole magical world.",
      "And if the whole wizarding world took a single Mark, they would\nbe a danger to the rest of humanity.",
      "No one knew quite how many wizards there were in the world. He'd\ndone a few estimates with Hermione and come up with numbers in the\nrough range of a million.",
      "But there were six billion Muggles.",
      "If it came down to a final war...",
      "Professor Quirrell had forgotten to ask Harry which side he\nwould protect.",
      "A scientific civilization, reaching outward, looking upward,\nknowing that its destiny was to grasp the stars.",
      "And a magical civilization, slowly fading as knowledge was lost,\nstill governed by a nobility that saw Muggles as not quite\nhuman.",
      "It was a terribly sad feeling, but not one that held any hint of\ndoubt.",
      "Aftermath: Blaise Zabini.",
      "Blaise strolled through the hallways with careful, self-imposed\nslowness, his heart beating wildly as he tried to calm down -",
      "\"Ahem,\" said a dry, whispering voice from a shadowy alcove as he\npassed.",
      "Blaise jumped, but he didn't scream.",
      "Slowly, he turned.",
      "In that small, shadowy corner was a black cloak so wide and\nbillowing that it was impossible to determine whether the figure\nbeneath was male or female, and atop the cloak a broad-brimmed\nblack hat, and a black mist seemed to gather beneath it and obscure\nthe face of whoever or whatever might lie beneath.",
      "\"Report,\" whispered Mr. Hat and Cloak.",
      "\"I said just what you told me to,\" said Blaise. His voice was a\nlittle calmer now that he wasn't lying to anyone. \"And Professor\nQuirrell reacted just the way you expected.\"",
      "The broad black hat tilted and straightened, as though the head\nbelow had nodded. \"Excellent,\" said the unidentifiable whisper.\n\"The reward I promised you is already on its way to your mother, by\nowl.\"",
      "Blaise hesitated, but his curiosity was eating him alive. \"Can I\nask now why you want to cause trouble between Professor Quirrell\nand Dumbledore?\" The Headmaster hadn't had anything to do with the\nGryffindor bullies that Blaise knew about, and besides helping\nKimberly, the Headmaster had also offered to make Professor Binns\ngive him excellent marks in History of Magic even if he turned in\nblank parchments for his homework, though he'd still have to attend\nclass and pretend to hand them in. Actually Blaise would have\nbetrayed all three generals for free, and never mind his cousin\neither, but he'd seen no need to say that.",
      "The broad black hat cocked to one side, as if to convey a\nquizzical stare. \"Tell me, friend Blaise, did it occur to you that\ntraitors who betray so many times over often meet with ill\nends?\"",
      "\"Nope,\" said Blaise, looking straight into the black mist under\nthe hat. \"Everyone knows that nothing really bad ever\nhappens to students in Hogwarts.\"",
      "Mr. Hat and Cloak gave a whispery chuckle. \"Indeed,\" said the\nwhisper. \"With the murder of one student five decades ago being the\nexception that proves the rule, since Salazar Slytherin would have\nkeyed his monster into the ancient wards at a higher level than the\nHeadmaster himself.\"",
      "Blaise stared at the black mist, now beginning to feel a little\nuneasy. But it ought to take a Hogwarts professor to do anything\nsignificant to him without setting off alarms. Quirrell and Snape\nwere the only professors who'd do something like this, and Quirrell\nwouldn't care about fooling himself, and Snape wouldn't\nhurt one of his own Slytherins... would he?",
      "\"No, friend Blaise,\" whispered the black mist, \"I only wished to\nadvise you never to try anything like this in your adult life. So\nmany betrayals would certainly lead to at least one vengeance.\"",
      "\"My mother never got any vengeances,\" said Blaise\nproudly. \"Even though she married seven husbands and every\nsingle one of them died mysteriously and left her lots of\nmoney.\"",
      "\"Really?\" said the whisper. \"However did she persuade the\nseventh to marry her after he heard what happened to the first\nsix?\"",
      "\"I asked Mum that,\" said Blaise, \"and she said I couldn't know\nuntil I was old enough, and I asked her how old was old enough, and\nshe said, older than her.\"",
      "Again the whispery chuckle. \"Well then, friend Blaise, my\ncongratulations on having followed in your mother's footsteps. Go,\nand if you say nothing of this, we will not meet again.\"",
      "Blaise backed uneasily away, feeling an odd reluctance to turn\nhis back.",
      "The hat tilted. \"Oh, come now, little Slytherin. If you were\ntruly the equal of Harry Potter or Draco Malfoy, you would have\nalready realized that my hinted threats were just to ensure your\nsilence before Albus. Had I intended to harm, I would not have\nhinted; had I said nothing, then you should have\nworried.\"",
      "Blaise straightened, feeling a little insulted, and nodded to\nMr. Hat and Cloak; then turned decisively and strode off toward his\nmeeting with the Headmaster.",
      "He'd been hoping to the very end that someone else\nwould show up and give him a chance to sell out Mr. Hat and\nCloak.",
      "But then Mum hadn't betrayed seven different husbands at the\nsame time. When you looked at it that way, he was\nstill doing better than her.",
      "And Blaise Zabini went on walking toward the Headmaster's\noffice, smiling, content to be a quintuple agent -",
      "For a moment the boy stumbled, but then straightened, shaking\noff the odd feeling of disorientation.",
      "And Blaise Zabini went on walking toward the Headmaster's\noffice, smiling, content to be a quadruple agent.",
      "Aftermath: Hermione Granger.",
      "The messenger didn't approach her until she was alone.",
      "Hermione was just leaving the girl's bathroom where she\nsometimes hid to think, and a bright shining cat leaped out of\nnowhere and said, \"Miss Granger?\"",
      "She let out a little shriek before she realized the cat had\nspoken in Professor McGonagall's voice.",
      "Even so she hadn't been frightened, only startled; the cat was\nbright and brilliant and beautiful, glowing with a white silver\nradiance like moon-colored sunlight, and she couldn't imagine being\nscared.",
      "\"What are you?\" said Hermione.",
      "\"This is a message from Professor McGonagall,\" said the cat,\nstill in the Professor's voice. \"Can you come to my office, and not\nspeak of this to anyone?\"",
      "\"I'll be there right away,\" said Hermione, still surprised, and\nthe cat leaped and vanished; only it didn't vanish, it traveled\naway somehow; or that was what her mind said, even though her eyes\njust saw it disappear.",
      "By the time Hermione had got to the office of her favorite\nprofessor, her mind was all a-whirl with speculations. Was there\nsomething wrong with her Transfiguration scores? But then why would\nProfessor McGonagall say not to tell anyone? It was probably about\nHarry practicing his partial Transfiguration...",
      "Professor McGonagall's face looked worried, not stern, as\nHermione seated herself in front of the desk - trying to keep her\neyes from going to the nest of cubbyholes containing Professor\nMcGonagall's homework, she'd always wondered what sort of work\ngrownups had to do to keep the school running and whether they\ncould use any help from her...",
      "\"Miss Granger,\" said Professor McGonagall, \"let me start by\nsaying that I already know about the Headmaster asking you to make\nthat wish -\"",
      "\"He told you?\" blurted Hermione in startlement. The\nHeadmaster had said no one else was supposed to know!",
      "Professor McGonagall paused, looked at Hermione, and gave a sad\nlittle chuckle. \"It's good to see Mr. Potter hasn't corrupted you\ntoo much. Miss Granger, you aren't supposed to admit\nanything just because I say I know. As it happens, the Headmaster\ndid not tell me, I simply know him too well.\"",
      "Hermione was blushing furiously now.",
      "\"It's fine, Miss Granger!\" said Professor McGonagall hastily.\n\"You're a Ravenclaw in your first year, nobody expects you to be a\nSlytherin.\"",
      "That really stung.",
      "\"Fine,\" said Hermione with some acerbity, \"I'll go ask Harry\nPotter for Slytherin lessons, then.\"",
      "\"That wasn't what I wanted to...\" said Professor\nMcGonagall, and her voice trailed off. \"Miss Granger, I'm worried\nabout this because young Ravenclaw girls shouldn't have to\nbe Slytherins! If the Headmaster asks you to get involved in\nsomething you're not comfortable with, Miss Granger, it really is\nall right to say no. And if you're feeling pressured, please tell\nthe Headmaster that you would like me to be there, or that you\nwould like to ask me first.\"",
      "Hermione's eyes were very wide. \"Does the Headmaster do things\nthat are wrong?\"",
      "Professor McGonagall looked a little sad at that. \"Not on\npurpose, Miss Granger, but I think... well, it probably is\ntrue that sometimes the Headmaster has trouble remembering what\nit's like to be a child. Even when he was a child, I'm sure he must\nhave been brilliant, and strong of mind and heart, with courage\nenough for three Gryffindors. Sometimes the Headmaster asks too\nmuch of his young students, Miss Granger, or isn't careful enough\nnot to hurt them. He is a good man, but sometimes his plotting can\ngo too far.\"",
      "\"But it's good for students to be strong and have\ncourage,\" said Hermione. \"That's why you suggested Gryffindor for\nme, wasn't it?\"",
      "Professor McGonagall smiled wryly. \"Perhaps I was only being\nselfish, wanting you for my own House. Did the Sorting Hat offer\nyou - no, I should not have asked.\"",
      "\"It told me I might go anywhere but Slytherin,\" said Hermione.\nShe'd almost asked why she wasn't good enough for\nSlytherin, before she'd managed to stop herself... \"So I\nhave courage, Professor!\"",
      "Professor McGonagall leaned forward over her desk. The worry was\nshowing plainer on her face now. \"Miss Granger, it's not about\ncourage, it's about what's healthy for young girls! The Headmaster\nis drawing you into his plots, Harry Potter is giving you his\nsecrets to keep, and now you're making alliances with Draco Malfoy!\nAnd I promised your mother that you would be safe at Hogwarts!\"",
      "Hermione just didn't know what to say to that. But the thought\nwas occurring to her that Professor McGonagall might not have been\nwarning her if she'd been a boy in Gryffindor instead of a girl in\nRavenclaw and that was, well... \"I'll try to be good,\" she\nsaid, \"and I won't let anyone tell me otherwise.\"",
      "Professor McGonagall pressed her hands over her eyes. When she\ntook them away, her lined face looked very old. \"Yes,\" she said in\na whisper, \"you would have done well in my House. Stay safe, Miss\nGranger, and be careful. And if you are ever worried or\nuncomfortable about anything, please come to me at once. I won't\nkeep you any longer.\"",
      "Aftermath, Draco Malfoy:",
      "Neither of them really wanted to do anything complicated that\nSaturday, not after fighting a battle earlier. So Draco was just\nsitting in an unused classroom and trying to read a book called\nThinking Physics. It was one of the most fascinating\nthings that Draco had ever read in his life, at least the parts he\ncould understand, at least when the accursed idiot who\nrefused to let his books out of his sight could manage to shut\nup and let Draco concentrate -",
      "\"Hermione Granger is a muuudbloood,\" sang Harry Potter\nfrom where he sat at a nearby desk, reading a far more advanced\nbook of his own.",
      "\"I know what you're trying to do,\" said Draco calmly without\nlooking up from the pages. \"It's not going to work. We're still\nganging up and crushing you.\"",
      "\"A Maaaalfoy is working with a muuudbloood,\nwhat will all your father's frieeeends think -\"",
      "\"They'll think Malfoys aren't as easily manipulated as\nyou seem to believe, Potter!\u202f\"",
      "The Defense Professor was crazier than Dumbledore, no future\nsaviour of the world could ever be this childish and\nundignified at any age.",
      "\"Hey, Draco, you know what's really going to suck? You\nknow that Hermione Granger has two copies of the magical allele,\njust like you and just like me, but all your classmates in\nSlytherin don't know that and yooouuu're not allowed to\nexplaaaaain -\"",
      "Draco's fingers were whitening where they gripped the book.\nBeing beaten and spat upon couldn't possibly require this much\nself-control, and if he didn't get back at Harry soon, he was going\nto do something incriminating -",
      "\"So what did you wish the first time?\" said Draco.",
      "Harry didn't say anything, so Draco looked up from his book, and\nfelt a twinge of malicious satisfaction at the sad look on Harry's\nface.",
      "\"Um,\" Harry said. \"A lot of people asked me that, but I don't\nthink Professor Quirrell would have wanted me to talk about\nit.\"",
      "Draco put a serious look on his own face. \"You can talk about it\nwith me. It's probably not important compared to the other\nsecrets you've told me, and what else are friends for?\" That's\nright, I'm your friend! Feel guilty!",
      "\"It wasn't really all that interesting,\" Harry said with\nobviously artificial lightness. \"Just, I wish Professor\nQuirrell would teach Battle Magic again next year.\"",
      "Harry sighed, and looked back down at his book.",
      "And said, after another few seconds, \"Your father's probably\ngoing to be pretty upset with you this Christmas, but if you\npromise him that you'll betray the mudblood girl and wipe out her\narmy, everything will go back to being all right, and you'll still\nget your Christmas presents.\"",
      "Maybe if he and Granger asked Professor Quirrell extra politely\nand used some of their Quirrell points, the two of them would be\nallowed to do something more interesting to General Chaos than\nputting him to sleep."

      "Wrenching disorientation, that was how it felt to walk out of\nPlatform Nine and Three-Quarters into the rest of Earth, the world\nthat Harry had once thought was the only real world. People dressed\nin casual shirts and pants, instead of the more dignified robes of\nwizards and witches. Scattered bits of trash here and there around\nthe benches. A forgotten smell, the fumes of burned gasoline, raw\nand sharp in the air. The ambiance of the King's Cross train\nstation, less bright and cheerful than Hogwarts or Diagon Alley;\nthe people seemed smaller, more afraid, and likely would have\neagerly traded their problems for a dark wizard to fight. Harry\nwanted to cast Scourgify for the dirt, and Everto\nfor the garbage, and if he'd known the spell, a Bubble-Head Charm\nso he wouldn't have to breathe the air. But he couldn't use his\nwand, in this place...",
      "This, Harry realized, must be what it felt like to go from a\nFirst World country to a Third World country.",
      "Only it was the Zeroth World which Harry had left, the wizarding\nworld, of Cleansing Charms and house elves; where, between the\nhealer's arts and your own magic, you could hit one hundred and\nseventy before old age really started catching up with you.",
      "And nonmagical London, Muggle Earth, to which Harry had\ntemporarily returned. This was where Mum and Dad would live out the\nrest of their lives, unless technology leapfrogged over wizardry's\nquality of life, or something deeper in the world changed.",
      "Without even thinking about it, Harry's head turned and his eyes\ndarted behind him to see the wooden trunk that was scurrying after\nhim, unnoticed by any Muggles, the clawed tentacles offering quick\nconfirmation that, yes, he hadn't just imagined it all...",
      "And then there was the other reason for the tight feeling in his\nchest.",
      "His parents didn't know.",
      "They didn't know anything.",
      "They didn't know...",
      "\"Harry?\" called a thin, blonde woman whose perfectly smooth and\nunblemished skin made her look a good deal younger than\nthirty-three; and Harry realized with a start that it was\nmagic, he hadn't known the signs before but he could see them now.\nAnd whatever sort of potion lasted that long, it must have been\nterribly dangerous, because most witches didn't do that to\nthemselves, they weren't that desperate...",
      "There was water gathering in Harry's eyes.",
      "\"Harry?\u202f\" yelled an older-looking man with a paunch\ngathering about his stomach, dressed with ostentatious academic\ncarelessness in a black vest thrown over a dark grey-green shirt,\nsomeone who would always be a professor anywhere he went, who would\ncertainly have been one of the most brilliant wizards of his\ngeneration, if he'd been born with two copies of that gene, instead\nof zero...",
      "Harry raised his hand and waved to them. He couldn't speak. He\ncouldn't speak at all.",
      "They came over to him, not running, but at a steady, dignified\nwalk; that was how fast Professor Michael Verres-Evans walked, and\nMrs. Petunia Evans-Verres wasn't about to walk any faster.",
      "The smile on his father's face wasn't very wide, but then his\nfather never was given to huge smiles; it was, at least, as wide as\nHarry had ever seen it, wider than when a new grant came in, or\nwhen one of his students got a position, and you couldn't ask for a\nwider smile than that.",
      "Mum was blinking hard, and she was trying to smile but not doing\na very good job.",
      "\"So!\" said his father as he came striding up. \"Made any\nrevolutionary discoveries yet?\"",
      "Of course Dad thought he was joking.",
      "It hadn't hurt quite so much when his parents didn't believe in\nhim, back when no one else had believed in him either,\nback when Harry hadn't known how it felt to be taken\nseriously by people like Headmaster Dumbledore and Professor\nQuirrell.",
      "And that was when Harry realized that the Boy-Who-Lived only\nexisted in magical Britain, that there wasn't any such person in\nMuggle London, just a cute little eleven-year-old boy going home\nfor Christmas.",
      "\"Excuse me,\" Harry said, his voice trembling, \"I'm going to\nbreak down and cry now, it doesn't mean there was anything wrong at\nschool.\"",
      "Harry started to move forward, and then stopped, torn between\nhugging his father and hugging his mother, he didn't want either\none to feel slighted or that Harry loved them more than the other\n-",
      "\"You,\" said his father, \"are a very silly boy, Mr. Verres,\" and\nhe gently took Harry by the shoulders and pushed him into the arms\nof his mother, who was kneeling down, tears already streaking her\ncheek.",
      "\"Hello, Mum,\" Harry said with his voice wavering, \"I'm back.\"\nAnd he hugged her, amid the noisy mechanical sounds and the smell\nof burned gasoline; and Harry started crying, because he knew that\nnothing could go back, least of all him.",
      "The sky was completely dark, and stars were coming out, by the\ntime they negotiated the Christmas traffic to the university town\nthat was Oxford, and parked in the driveway of the small,\ndingy-looking old house that their family used to keep the rain off\ntheir books.",
      "As they walked up the brief stretch of pavement leading to the\nfront door, they passed a series of flower-pots holding small, dim\nelectric lights (dim since they had to recharge themselves off\nsolar power during the day), and the lights lit up just as they\npassed. The hard part had been finding motion sensors that were\nwaterproof and triggered at just the right distance...",
      "In Hogwarts there were real torches like that.",
      "And then the front door opened and Harry stepped into their\nliving-room, blinking hard.",
      "Every inch of wall space is covered by a bookcase. Each\nbookcase has six shelves, going almost to the ceiling. Some\nbookshelves are stacked to the brim with hardcover books: science,\nmath, history, and everything else. Other shelves have two layers\nof paperback science fiction, with the back layer of books propped\nup on old tissue boxes or two-by-fours, so that you can see the\nback layer of books above the books in front. And it still isn't\nenough. Books are overflowing onto the tables and the sofas and\nmaking little heaps under the windows...",
      "The Verres household was just as he'd left it, only with more\nbooks, which was also just how he'd left it.",
      "And a Christmas tree, naked and undecorated just two days before\nChristmas Eve, which threw Harry briefly before he realized, with a\nwarm feeling blossoming in his chest, that of course his parents\nhad waited.",
      "\"We took the bed out of your room to make room for more\nbookcases,\" said his father. \"You can sleep in your trunk,\nright?\"",
      "\"You can sleep in my trunk,\" said Harry.",
      "\"That reminds me,\" said his father. \"What did they end\nup doing about your sleep cycle?\"",
      "\"Magic,\" Harry said, making a beeline for the door that opened\nupon his bedroom, just in case Dad wasn't joking...",
      "\"That's not an explanation!\" said Professor Verres-Evans, just\nas Harry shouted, \"You used up all the open space on my\nbookcases?\u202f\"",
      "Harry had spent the 23rd of December shopping for Muggle things\nthat he couldn't just Transfigure; his father had been busy and had\nsaid that Harry would need to walk or take the bus, which had\nsuited Harry just fine. Some of the people at the hardware store\nhad given Harry questioning looks, but he'd said with an innocent\nvoice that his father was shopping nearby and was very busy and had\nsent him to get some things (holding up a list in carefully\nadult-looking half-illegible handwriting); and in the end, money\nwas money.",
      "They had all decorated the Christmas tree together, and Harry\nhad put a tiny dancing fairy on top (two Sickles, five Knuts at\nGambol & Japes).",
      "Gringotts had readily exchanged Galleons for paper money, but\nthey didn't seem to have any simple way to turn larger quantities\nof gold into tax-free, unsuspicious Muggle money in a numbered\nSwiss bank account. This had rather spiked Harry's plan to turn\nmost of the money he'd self-stolen into a sensible mix of 60%\ninternational index funds and 40% Berkshire Hathaway. For the\nmoment, Harry had diversified his assets a little further by\nsneaking out late at night, invisible and Time-Turned, and burying\none hundred golden Galleons in the backyard. He'd always always\nalways wanted to do that anyway.",
      "Some of December 24th had been spent with the Professor reading\nHarry's books and asking questions. Most of the experiments his\nfather had suggested were impractical, at least for the moment; of\nthose remaining, Harry had done many of them already. (\"Yes, Dad, I\nchecked what happened if Hermione was given a changed pronunciation\nand she didn't know whether it was changed, that was the very first\nexperiment I did, Dad!\")",
      "The last question Harry's father had asked, looking up from\nMagical Draughts and Potions with an expression of\nbewildered disgust, was whether it all made sense if you were a\nwizard; and Harry had answered no.",
      "Whereupon his father had declared that magic was\nunscientific.",
      "Harry was still a little shocked at the idea of pointing to a\nsection of reality and calling it unscientific. Dad seemed\nto think that the conflict between his intuitions and the universe\nmeant that the universe had a problem.",
      "(Then again, there were lots of physicists who thought that\nquantum mechanics was weird, instead of quantum mechanics being\nnormal and them being weird.)",
      "Harry had shown his mother the healer's kit he'd bought to keep\nin their house, though most of the potions wouldn't work on Dad.\nMum had stared at the kit in a way that made Harry ask whether\nMum's sister had ever bought anything like that for Grandpa Edwin\nand Grandma Elaine. And when Mum still hadn't answered, Harry had\nsaid hastily that she must have just never thought of it. And then,\nfinally, he'd fled the room.",
      "Lily Evans probably hadn't thought of it, that was the\nsad thing. Harry knew that other people had a tendency to not-think\nabout painful subjects, in the same way they had a tendency not to\ndeliberately rest their hands on red-hot stove burners; and Harry\nwas starting to suspect that most Muggleborns rapidly acquired a\ntendency to not-think about their family, who were all going to die\nbefore they reached their first century anyway.",
      "Not that Harry had any intention of letting that\nhappen, of course.",
      "And then it was late in the day on December 24th and they were\ndriving off for their Christmas Eve dinner.",
      "The house was huge, not by Hogwarts standards, but certainly by\nthe standards of what you could get if your father was a\ndistinguished professor trying to live in Oxford. Two stories of\nbrick gleaming in the setting sun, with windows on top of windows\nand one tall window that went up much further than glass should go,\nthat was going to be one huge living room...",
      "Harry took a deep breath, and rang the doorbell.",
      "There was a distant call of \"Honey, can you get it?\"",
      "This was followed by a slow patter of approaching steps.",
      "And then the door opened to reveal a genial man, of fat and rosy\ncheeks and thinning hair, in a blue button-down shirt straining\nslightly at the seams.",
      "\"Dr. Granger?\" Harry's father said briskly, before Harry could\neven speak. \"I'm Michael, and this is Petunia and our son Harry.\nThe food's in the magical trunk,\" and Dad made a vague gesture\nbehind him - not quite in the direction of the trunk, as it\nhappened.",
      "\"Yes, please, come in,\" said Leo Granger. He stepped forward and\ntook the wine bottle from the Professor's outstretched hands, with\na muttered \"Thank you,\" and then stepped back and waved at the\nliving room. \"Have a seat. And,\" his head turning down to address\nHarry, \"all the toys are downstairs in the basement, I'm sure Herm\nwill be down shortly, it's the first door on your right,\" and\npointed toward a hallway.",
      "Harry just looked at him for a moment, conscious that he was\nblocking his parents from coming in.",
      "\"Toys?\" said Harry in a bright, high-pitched voice, with his\neyes wide. \"I love toys!\"",
      "There was an intake of breath from his mother behind him, and\nHarry strode into the house, managing not to stomp too hard as he\nwalked.",
      "The living room was every bit as large as it had looked from\noutside, with a huge vaulted ceiling dangling a gigantic\nchandelier, and a Christmas tree that must have been murder to\nmaneuver through the door. The lower levels of the tree were\nthoroughly and carefully decorated in neat patterns of red and\ngreen and gold, with a newfound sprinkling of blue and bronze; the\nheights that only a grownup could reach were carelessly, randomly\ndraped with strings of lights and wreaths of tinsel. A hallway\nextended until it terminated in the cabinetry of a kitchen, and\nwooden stairs with polished metal railings stretched up toward a\nsecond floor.",
      "\"Gosh!\" Harry said. \"This is a big house! I hope I don't get\nlost in here!\"",
      "Dr. Roberta Granger was feeling rather nervous as dinner\napproached. The turkey and the roast, their own contributions to\nthe common project, were steadily cooking away in the oven; the\nother dishes were to be brought by their guests, the Verres family,\nwho had adopted a boy named Harry. Who was known to the wizarding\nworld as the Boy-Who-Lived. And who was also the only boy that\nHermione had ever called \"cute\", or noticed at all, really.",
      "The Verreses had said that Hermione was the only child in\nHarry's age group whose existence their son had ever acknowledged\nin any way whatsoever.",
      "And it might've been jumping the gun just a little; but both\ncouples had a sneaking suspicion that wedding bells might be in the\noffing a few years down the road.",
      "So while Christmas Day would be spent, as always, with her\nhusband's family, they'd decided to spend Christmas Eve meeting\ntheir daughter's possible future in-laws.",
      "The doorbell rang while she was right in the middle of basting\nthe turkey, and she raised her voice and shouted, \"Honey, can\nyou get it?\u202f\"",
      "There was a brief groan of a chair and its occupant, and then\nthere was the sound of her husband's heavy footsteps and the door\nswinging open.",
      "\"Dr. Granger?\" said an older man's brisk voice. \"I'm Michael,\nand this is Petunia and our son Harry. The food's in the magical\ntrunk.\"",
      "\"Yes, please, come in,\" said her husband, followed by a muttered\n\"Thank you\" that indicated some sort of present had been accepted,\nand \"Have a seat.\" Then Leo's voice altered to a tone of artificial\nenthusiasm, and said, \"And all the toys are downstairs in the\nbasement, I'm sure Herm will be down shortly, it's the first door\non your right.\"",
      "There was a brief pause.",
      "Then a young boy's bright voice said, \"Toys? I love toys!\"",
      "There was the sound of footsteps entering the house, and then\nthe same bright voice said, \"Gosh! This is a big house! I hope I\ndon't get lost in here!\"",
      "Roberta closed up the oven, smiling. She'd been a bit worried\nabout the way Hermione's letters had described the Boy-Who-Lived -\nthough certainly her daughter hadn't said anything indicating that\nHarry Potter was dangerous; nothing like the dark hints\nwritten in the books Roberta had bought, supposedly for Hermione,\nduring their trip to Diagon Alley. Her daughter hadn't said much at\nall, only that Harry talked like he came out of a book, and\nHermione was studying harder than she ever had in her life just to\nstay ahead of him in class. But from the sound of it, Harry Potter\nwas an ordinary eleven-year-old boy.",
      "She got to the front door just as her daughter came clattering\nfrantically down the stairs at a speed that didn't look safe at\nall, Hermione had claimed that witches were more resistant to falls\nbut Roberta wasn't quite sure she believed that -",
      "Roberta took in her first sight of Professor and Mrs. Verres,\nwho were both looking rather nervous, just as the boy with the\nlegendary scar on his forehead turned to her daughter and said, now\nin a lower voice, \"Well met on this fairest of evenings, Miss\nGranger.\" His hand stretched back, as though offering his parents\non a silver platter. \"I present to you my father, Professor Michael\nVerres-Evans, and my mother, Mrs. Petunia Evans-Verres.\"",
      "And as Roberta's mouth was gaping open, the boy turned back to\nhis parents and said, now in that bright voice again, \"Mum, Dad,\nthis is Hermione! She's really smart!\"",
      "\"Harry!\u202f\" hissed her daughter. \"Stop that!\"",
      "The boy swiveled again to regard Hermione. \"I'm afraid, Miss\nGranger,\" the boy said gravely, \"that you and I have been exiled to\nthe labyrinthine recesses of the basement. Let us leave them to\ntheir adult conversations, which would no doubt soar far above our\nown childish intellects, and resume our ongoing discussion of the\nimplications of Humean projectivism for Transfiguration.\"",
      "\"Excuse us, please,\" said her daughter in a very firm tone, and\ngrabbed the boy by his left sleeve, and dragged him into the\nhallway - Roberta swiveled helplessly to track them as they went\npast her, the boy gave her a cheery wave - and then Hermione pulled\nthe boy into the basement access and slammed the door behind\nher.",
      "\"I, ah, I apologize for...\" said Mrs. Verres in a faltering\nvoice.",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" said the Professor, smiling fondly, \"Harry can be a\nbit touchy about that sort of thing. But I expect he's right about\nus not being interested in their conversation.\"",
      "Is he dangerous? Roberta wanted to ask, but she kept\nher silence and tried to think of subtler questions. Her husband\nbeside her was chuckling, as if he'd found what they'd just seen\nfunny, rather than frightening.",
      "The most terrible Dark Lord in history had tried to kill that\nboy, and the burnt husk of his body had been found next to the\ncrib.",
      "Her possible future son-in-law.",
      "Roberta had been increasingly apprehensive about giving her\ndaughter over to witchcraft - especially after she'd read the\nbooks, put the dates together, and realized that her magical mother\nhad probably been killed at the height of Grindelwald's terror,\nnot died giving birth to her as her father had always\nclaimed. But Professor McGonagall had made other visits after her\nfirst trip, to \"see how Miss Granger is doing\"; and Roberta\ncouldn't help but think that if Hermione said her parents were\nbeing troublesome about her witching career, something would be\ndone to fix them...",
      "Roberta put her best smile on her face, and did what she could\nto spread some pretended Christmas cheer.",
      "The dining room table was much longer than six people - er, four\npeople and two children - really needed, but all of it was draped\nwith a tablecloth of fine white linen, and the dishes had been\nneedlessly transferred to fancy serving plates, which at least were\nof stainless steel rather than real silver.",
      "Harry was having a bit of trouble concentrating on the\nturkey.",
      "The conversation had turned to Hogwarts, naturally; and it'd\nbeen obvious to Harry that his parents were hoping that Hermione\nwould trip up and say more about Harry's school life than Harry had\nbeen telling them. And either Hermione had realized this, or she\nwas just automatically steering clear of anything that might prove\ntroublesome.",
      "So Harry was fine.",
      "But unfortunately Harry had made the mistake of owling his\nparents with all sorts of facts about Hermione that she hadn't told\nher own parents.",
      "Like that she was general of an army in their after-school\nactivities.",
      "Hermione's mother had looked very alarmed, and Harry had quickly\ninterrupted and done his best to explain that all the spells were\nstunners, Professor Quirrell was always watching, and the existence\nof magical healing meant that lots of things were much less\ndangerous than they sounded, at which point Hermione had kicked him\nhard under the table. Thankfully Harry's father, who Harry had to\nadmit was better than him at some things, had announced with firm\nprofessorial authority that he hadn't worried at all, since he\ncouldn't imagine children being allowed to do it if it was\ndangerous.",
      "That wasn't why Harry was having trouble enjoying dinner,\nthough.",
      "...the problem with feeling sorry for yourself was that it never\ntook any time at all to find someone else who had it worse.",
      "Dr. Leo Granger had asked, at one point, whether that nice\nteacher who'd seemed to like Hermione, Professor McGonagall, was\nawarding her lots of points in school.",
      "Hermione had said yes, with an apparently genuine smile.",
      "Harry had managed, with some effort, to stop himself from icily\npointing out that Professor McGonagall would never show favoritism\nto any Hogwarts student, and that Hermione was getting lots of\npoints because she'd earned every, single, one.",
      "At another point, Leo Granger had offered the table his opinion\nthat Hermione was very smart and could have gone to medical school\nand become a dentist, if not for the whole witch business.",
      "Hermione had smiled again, and a quick glance had prevented\nHarry from suggesting Hermione might also have been an\ninternationally famous scientist, and asking whether that\nthought would've occurred to the Grangers if they'd had a\nson instead of a daughter, or if it was\nunacceptable either way for their offspring to do better than\nthem.",
      "But Harry was rapidly reaching his boiling point.",
      "And becoming a lot more appreciative of the fact that\nhis own father had always done everything he could to\nsupport Harry's development as a prodigy and always\nencouraged him to reach higher and never belittled a\nsingle one of his accomplishments, even if a child prodigy was\nstill just a child. Was this the sort of household he could have\nended up in, if Mum had married Vernon Dursley?",
      "Harry was doing what he could, though.",
      "\"And she's really beating you in all your classes\nexcept broomstick riding and Transfiguration?\" said Professor\nMichael Verres-Evans.",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry said with forced calm, as he cut himself another\nbite of Christmas Eve turkey. \"By solid margins, in most of them.\"\nThere were other circumstances under which Harry would have been\nmore reluctant to admit that, which was why he hadn't gotten around\nto telling his father until now.",
      "\"Hermione has always been quite good in school,\" said Dr. Leo\nGranger in a satisfied tone.",
      "\"Harry competes at the national level!\" said Professor Michael\nVerres-Evans.",
      "\"Dear!\" said Petunia.",
      "Hermione was giggling, and that wasn't making Harry feel any\nbetter about her situation. It didn't seem to bother Hermione and\nthat bothered Harry.",
      "\"I'm not embarrassed to lose to her, Dad,\" Harry said. Right at\nthis moment he wasn't. \"Did I mention that she memorized all her\nschoolbooks before the first day of class? And yes, I tested\nit.\"",
      "\"Is that, ah, usual for her?\" Professor Verres-Evans\nsaid to the Grangers.",
      "\"Oh, yes, Hermione's always memorizing things,\" said Dr. Roberta\nGranger with a cheerful smile. \"She knows every recipe in all my\ncookbooks by heart. I miss her every time I make dinner.\"",
      "Judging by the look on his father's face, Dad was feeling at\nleast some of what Harry felt.",
      "\"Don't worry, Dad,\" Harry said, \"she's getting all the advanced\nmaterial she can take, now. Her teachers at Hogwarts know she's\nsmart, unlike her parents!\u202f\"",
      "His voice had risen on the last three words, and even as all\nfaces turned to stare at him and Hermione kicked him again, Harry\nknew that he'd blown it, but it was too much, just way too\nmuch.",
      "\"Of course we know she's smart,\" said Leo Granger, starting to\nlook offended at the child who'd had the temerity to raise his\nvoice at their dinner table.",
      "\"You don't have the tiniest idea,\" said Harry, the ice now\nleaking into his voice. \"You think she reads a lot of books and\nit's cute, right? You see a perfect report card and you think it's\ngood that she's doing well in class. Your daughter is the most\ntalented witch of her generation and the brightest star of\nHogwarts, and someday, Dr. and Dr. Granger, the fact that you were\nher parents will be the only reason that history remembers\nyou!\"",
      "Hermione, who had calmly got up from her seat and walked around\nthe table, chose that moment to grab Harry's shirt by the shoulder\nand pull him out of his chair. Harry let himself be pulled, but as\nHermione dragged him away, he said, raising his voice even louder,\n\"It is entirely possible that in a thousand years, the fact that\nHermione Granger's parents were dentists will be the only reason\nanyone remembers dentistry!\"",
      "Roberta stared at where her daughter had just dragged the\nBoy-Who-Lived out of the room with a patient look upon her young\nface.",
      "\"I'm terribly sorry,\" said Professor Verres with an amused\nsmile. \"But please don't worry, Harry always talks like that.\nAren't they just like a married couple already?\"",
      "The frightening thing was that they were.",
      "Harry had been expecting a rather severe lecture from\nHermione.",
      "But after Hermione pulled them into the basement access and\nclosed the door behind them, she'd turned around -",
      "- and was smiling, genuinely so far as Harry could tell.",
      "\"Please don't, Harry,\" she said in a soft voice. \"Even though\nit's very nice of you. Everything's fine.\"",
      "Harry just looked at her. \"How can you stand it?\" he said. He\nhad to keep his voice quiet, they didn't want the parents to hear,\nbut it rose in pitch if not in volume. \"How can you stand\nit?\u202f\"",
      "Hermione shrugged, and said, \"Because that's the way parents\nshould be?\"",
      "\"No,\" Harry said, his voice low and intense, \"it's not, my\nfather never puts me down - well, he does, but\nnever like that -\"",
      "Hermione held up a single finger, and Harry waited, watching her\nsearch for words. It took her a while before she said, \"Harry...\nProfessor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick like me because I'm the\nmost talented witch of my generation and the brightest star of\nHogwarts. And Mum and Dad don't know that, and you'll never be able\nto tell them, but they love me anyway. Which means that everything\nis just the way it should be, at Hogwarts and at home. And since\nthey're my parents, Mr. Potter, you don't get to\nargue.\" She was once again smiling her mysterious smile from\ndinnertime, and looking at Harry very fondly. \"Is that\nclear, Mr. Potter?\"",
      "Harry nodded tightly.",
      "\"Good,\" said Hermione, and leaned over and kissed him on the\ncheek.",
      "The conversation had only just gotten started again when a\ndistant high-pitched yelp floated back to them,",
      "\"Hey! No kissing!\u202f\"",
      "The two fathers burst out in laughter just as the two mothers\nrose up from their chairs with identical looks of horror and dashed\ntoward the basement.",
      "When the children had been brought back, Hermione was saying in\nan icy tone that she was never going to kiss Harry ever again, and\nHarry was saying in an outraged voice that the Sun would burn down\nto a cold dead cinder before he let her get close enough to\ntry.",
      "Which meant that everything was just the way it should be, and\nthey all sat back down again to finish their Christmas dinner."

      "It was almost midnight.",
      "Staying up late was simple enough for Harry. He just hadn't used\nthe Time-Turner. Harry followed a tradition of timing his sleep\ncycle to make sure he was awake for when Christmas Eve turned into\nChristmas Day; because while he'd never been young enough to\nbelieve in Santa Claus, he'd once been young enough to\ndoubt.",
      "It would have been nice if there had been a mysterious\nfigure who entered your house in the night and brought you\npresents...",
      "A chill went down Harry's spine then.",
      "An intimation of something dreadful approaching.",
      "A creeping terror.",
      "A sense of doom.",
      "Harry sat bolt upright in bed.",
      "He looked at the window.",
      "\"Professor Quirrell?\u202f\" Harry shrieked very quietly.",
      "Professor Quirrell made a slight lifting gesture, and Harry's\nwindow seemed to fold into its frame. At once a cold gust of winter\nblew into the room through the gap, along with a scant few flakes\nof snow from a sky spotted with grey night-clouds, amid the black\nand stars.",
      "\"Fear not, Mr. Potter,\" said the Defense Professor in a normal\nvoice. \"I have Charmed your parents asleep; they shall not wake\nuntil I have departed.\"",
      "\"No one's supposed to know where I am!\" said Harry, still\nkeeping the shriek quiet. \"Even owls are supposed to deliver my\nmail to Hogwarts, not here!\" Harry had agreed to that willingly; it\nwould be silly if a Death Eater could win the whole war at any time\njust by owling him a magically triggered hand grenade.",
      "Professor Quirrell was grinning, from where he stood in the\nbackyard beyond the window. \"Oh, I shouldn't worry, Mr. Potter. You\nare well protected against locating Charms, and no blood\npurist is likely to think of consulting a phone book.\" His grin\ngrew wider. \"And it did take considerable effort to cross the wards\nthat the Headmaster put around this house - though of course anyone\nwho knew your address could simply wait outside and attack you the\nnext time you left.\"",
      "Harry stared at Professor Quirrell for a while. \"What are you\ndoing here?\" Harry said finally.",
      "The smile left Professor Quirrell's face. \"I've come to\napologize, Mr. Potter,\" the Defense Professor said quietly. \"I\nshould not have spoken to you so harshly as I -\"",
      "\"Don't,\" Harry said. He looked down at the blanket that he was\nclutching around his pajamas. \"Just don't.\"",
      "\"Have I offended you that much?\" said Professor Quirrell's quiet\nvoice.",
      "\"No,\" Harry said. \"But you will if you apologize.\"",
      "\"I see,\" said Professor Quirrell, and in an instant his voice\ngrew stern. \"Then if I am to treat you as an equal, Mr. Potter, I\nshould say that you have gravely violated the etiquette that holds\nbetween friendly Slytherins. If you are not currently playing the\ngame against someone, you must not meddle in their plans\nlike that, not without asking them before. For you do not\nknow what their true design may be, nor what stakes they may lose.\nIt would mark you as their enemy, Mr. Potter.\"",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" Harry said, in just the same quiet tone that\nProfessor Quirrell had used.",
      "\"Apology accepted,\" said Professor Quirrell.",
      "\"But,\" Harry said, still quietly, \"you and I really must speak\nfurther on politics, at some point.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell sighed. \"I know you dislike condescension,\nMr. Potter -\"",
      "That was a bit of an understatement.",
      "\"But it would be even more condescending,\" said Professor\nQuirrell, \"if I were not to state it clearly. You are missing some\nlife experience, Mr. Potter.\"",
      "\"And does everyone who has sufficient life experience agree with\nyou, then?\" said Harry calmly.",
      "\"What good is life experience to someone who plays Quidditch?\"\nsaid Professor Quirrell, and shrugged. \"I think you will change\nyour mind in time, after every trust you place has failed you, and\nyou have become cynical.\"",
      "The Defense Professor said it as though it were the most\nordinary statement in the world, framed against the black and the\nstars and the cloud-spotted sky, as one or two tiny snowflakes blew\npast him in the biting winter air.",
      "\"That reminds me,\" said Harry. \"Merry Christmas.\"",
      "\"I suppose,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"After all, if it is\nnot an apology, then it must be a Christmas gift. The very\nfirst one I have ever given, in fact.\"",
      "Harry hadn't even started yet on learning Latin so he could read\nthe experimental diary of Roger Bacon; and he hardly dared open his\nmouth to ask.",
      "\"Put on your winter coat,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"or take a\nwarming potion if you have one; and meet me outside, under the\nstars. I shall see if I can maintain it a little longer this\ntime.\"",
      "It took Harry a moment to process the words, and then he was\ndashing for the coat closet.",
      "Professor Quirrell kept the spell of starlight going for more\nthan an hour, though the Defense Professor's face grew strained,\nand he had to sit down after a while. Harry protested only once,\nand was shushed.",
      "They crossed the boundary from Christmas Eve to Christmas Day\nwithin that timeless void where Earthly rotations meant nothing,\nthe one true everlasting Silent Night.",
      "And just as promised, Harry's parents slept soundly all through\nit, until Harry was safely back in his room, and the Defense\nProfessor had gone."

Some of the younger students wore scarves and mittens, but\nmost simply wore their robes; they were wizards, after all.",
      "After Harry had moved away from the landing platform, he took\noff his scarf and coat, opened a compartment of his trunk, and\nstowed away his winter things.",
      "For a long moment, he stood there letting the January air bite\nat him, just to see what it was like.",
      "Harry took out his wizards' robes, shrugged them on.",
      "And finally, Harry drew his wand; and he couldn't help thinking\nof the parents he'd only just kissed goodbye, of the world whose\nproblems he was leaving behind...",
      "With a strange feeling of guilt for the unavoidable, Harry said,\n\"Thermos.\"",
      "The warmth flowed through him.",
      "And the Boy-Who-Lived was back.",
      "Harry yawned and stretched, feeling more lethargic than anything\nelse at the conclusion of his vacation. He didn't feel like reading\nhis textbooks, or even any serious science fiction, this morning;\nwhat he needed was something completely frivolous to occupy his\nattention...",
      "Well, that wouldn't be hard to come by, if he was willing to\npart with four Knuts.",
      "Besides, if the Daily Prophet was corrupt and the\nQuibbler was the only competing newspaper, there might be\nsome suppressed real news in there.",
      "Harry trudged back over to the same newsstand from last time,\nwondering if the Quibbler could top the headline he'd seen\nbefore.",
      "The vendor started to smile as Harry approached, and then the\nman's face suddenly changed, as he caught sight of the scar.",
      "\"Harry Potter?\u202f\" gasped the vendor.",
      "\"No, Mr. Durian,\" said Harry, eyes dipping briefly to the man's\nnametag, \"just an amazing imitation -\"",
      "And then Harry's voice stopped in his throat, as he caught sight\nof the top fold of the Quibbler.",
      "SLOSHED SEER SPILLS\nSECRETS:\nDARK LORD TO RETURN,",
      "For just an instant, Harry tried to clamp down on his face,\nbefore realizing that not being shocked could be just as\nrevealing, in a sense -",
      "\"Excuse me,\" Harry said. His voice sounded a little alarmed, and\nhe didn't even know whether that was too revealing, or just what\nhis normal reaction would be if he didn't know anything.\nHe'd spent too much time around Slytherins, he was forgetting how\nto keep secrets from ordinary people. Four Knuts hit the counter.\n\"One copy of the Quibbler, please.\"",
      "\"Oh, no worries, Mr. Potter!\" said the vendor hastily, waving\nhis hands. \"It's - never mind, just -\"",
      "A newspaper flew through the air and hit Harry's fingers, and he\nunfolded it.",
      "SLOSHED SEER SPILLS\nSECRETS:\nDARK LORD TO RETURN,\nWED DRACO MALFOY",
      "\"It's free,\" said the vendor, \"for you, I mean -\"",
      "\"No,\" Harry said, \"I was going to buy one anyway.\"",
      "The vendor took the coins, and Harry read on.",
      "\"Gosh,\" Harry said half a minute later, \"you get a seer smashed\non six slugs of Scotch and she spills all sorts of secret\nstuff. I mean, who'd have thought that Sirius Black and Peter\nPettigrew were secretly the same person?\"",
      "\"Not me,\" said the vendor.",
      "\"They've even got a picture of the two of them together, so we\nknow who it is that's secretly the same person.\"",
      "\"Yup,\" said the vendor. \"Pretty clever disguise, innit?\"",

      "\"You don't look half that,\" the vendor said amiably.",
      "\"And I'm betrothed to Hermione Granger, and Bellatrix\nBlack, and Luna Lovegood, and oh yes, Draco Malfoy\ntoo...\"",
      "\"Goin' ter be one interesting wedding,\" said the vendor.",
      "Harry looked up from the newspaper, and said in a pleasant\nvoice, \"You know, I heard at first that Luna Lovegood was insane,\nand I wondered if she really was, or if she was just making stuff\nup and giggling to herself the whole time. Then when I read my\nsecond Quibbler headline, I decided that she\ncouldn't be insane, I mean, it can't be easy to\nmake this stuff up, you couldn't do it by accident. And\nnow do you know what I think? I think she must be mad\nafter all. When ordinary people try to make stuff up, it doesn't\ncome out like this. Something's got to go really\nwrong with the inside of your head before this is\nwhat comes out when you start making stuff up!\"",
      "The vendor stared at Harry.",
      "\"Seriously,\" said Harry. \"Who reads this stuff?\"",
      "\"You,\" said the vendor.",
      "Harry wandered off to read his newspaper.",
      "He didn't sit at the same nearby table he'd sat down at with\nDraco, the first time he'd prepared to board this train.\nThat seemed like tempting history to repeat itself.",
      "It wasn't just that his first week at Hogwarts had\nbeen, judging by the Quibbler, fifty-four years long. It\nwas that, in Harry's humble opinion, his life did not need\nany new threads of complexity.",
      "So Harry found a small iron chair somewhere else, distant from\nthe main crowd and the occasional muffled cracks of parents\nApparating in with their children, and sat down and read the\nQuibbler to see if it contained any suppressed news.",
      "And besides the obvious craziness (heaven help them all if any\nof that was real) there was a good deal of snide romantic\ngossip; but nothing that would really be all that\nimportant if it was true.",
      "Harry was just reading about the Ministry's proposed marriage\nlaw, to ban all marriages, when -",
      "\"Harry Potter,\" said a silken voice that sent a shock of\nadrenaline jolting through Harry's blood.",
      "Harry looked up.",
      "\"Lucius Malfoy,\" Harry said, his voice weary. Next time he was\ngoing to do the smart thing, and wait outside in the Muggle part of\nKing's Cross until 10:55am.",
      "Lucius inclined his head courteously, sending his long white\nhair drifting over his shoulders. The man was still carrying that\nsame cane, lacquered in black with a silver snake's head for its\nhandle; and something about his grip silently said this is a\nweapon of deadly power, not I am feeble and leaning on\nthis. His face was expressionless.",
      "Two men flanked him, their eyes continuously scanning, their\nwands already gripped low in their hands. The two of them moved\nlike a single organism with four legs and four arms, the senior\nCrabbe-and-Goyle, and Harry thought he could guess which was which,\nbut then it didn't really matter. They were merely Lucius's\nappendages, as certainly as if they'd been the two rightmost toes\non his left foot.",
      "\"I apologize for disturbing you, Mr. Potter,\" said the smooth,\nsilken voice. \"But you have answered none of my owls; and this, I\nthought, might be my only opportunity to meet you.\"",
      "\"I have received none of your owls,\" Harry said calmly.\n\"Dumbledore intercepted them, I presume. But I would not have\nanswered them if I had, except through Draco. For me to deal with\nyou directly, without Draco's knowledge, would trespass on our\nfriendship.\"",
      "Please go away, please go away...",
      "The grey eyes glittered at him. \"Is that your pose, then...\"\nsaid the senior Malfoy. \"Well. I shall play along a little. What\nwas your purpose in maneuvering your good friend, my son, into a\npublic alliance with that girl?\"",
      "\"Oh,\" Harry said lightly, \"that's obvious, right? Draco's\nworking with Granger will make him realize that Muggleborns are\nhuman after all. Bwa. Ha. Ha.\"",
      "A thin trace of a smile moved over Lucius's lips. \"Yes, that\ndoes sound like one of Dumbledore's plans. Which it is\nnot.\"",
      "\"Indeed,\" said Harry. \"It is part of my game with Draco, and no\nwork of Dumbledore's, and that is all I will say.\"",
      "\"Let us dispense with games,\" said the senior Malfoy, the grey\neyes suddenly hardening. \"If my suspicions are true, you would\nhardly do Dumbledore's bidding in any case, Mr.\nPotter.\"",
      "There was a slight pause.",
      "\"So you know,\" Harry said, his voice cold. \"Tell me. At which\npoint, exactly, did you realize?\"",
      "\"When I read your response to Professor Quirrell's little\nspeech,\" said the white-haired man, and chuckled grimly. \"I was\npuzzled, at first, for it seemed not in your own interest; it took\nme days to understand whose interest was being served, and then it\nall finally became clear. And it is also obvious that you are weak,\nin some ways if not others.\"",
      "\"Very clever of you,\" said Harry, still cold. \"But perhaps you\nmistake my interests.\"",
      "\"Perhaps I do.\" A hint of steel came into the silken voice.\n\"Indeed, that is precisely what I fear. You are playing strange\ngames with my son, to a purpose I cannot guess. That is not a\nfriendly act, and you cannot but expect me to be\nconcerned!\"",
      "Lucius was leaning upon his cane with both hands now, and both\nthose hands white, and his bodyguards had suddenly tensed.",
      "Some instinct within Harry claimed that it would be a very bad\nidea to show his fear, to let Lucius see that he could be\nintimidated. They were in a public train station anyway -",
      "\"I find it interesting,\" Harry said, putting steel into his own\nvoice, \"that you think I could benefit from doing Draco harm. But\nit is irrelevant, Lucius. He is my friend, and I do not\nbetray my friends.\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" whispered Lucius. His face showed sheer\nshock.",
      "Then -",
      "\"Company,\" said one of the minions, and Harry thought, from the\nvoice, that it must be the senior Crabbe.",
      "Lucius straightened and turned, then let out a hiss of\ndisapproval.",
      "Neville was approaching, looking scared but determined, in tow\nbehind a tall woman who didn't look scared at all.",
      "\"Madam Longbottom,\" Lucius said icily.",
      "\"Mr. Malfoy,\" returned the woman with equal ice. \"Are you being\nan annoyance to our Harry Potter?\"",
      "The bark of laughter that came from Lucius seemed strangely\nbitter. \"Oh, I rather think not. Come to protect him from me, have\nyou?\" The white-haired head shifted toward Neville. \"And this would\nbe Mr. Potter's loyal lieutenant, the last scion of Longbottom,\nNeville, self-styled of Chaos. How strangely does the world turn.\nSometimes I think it must all be mad.\"",
      "Harry had no idea at all what to say to that, and Neville looked\nconfused, and frightened.",
      "\"I doubt it is the world that is mad,\" said Madam Longbottom.\nHer voice took on a gloating tone. \"You seem in a poor mood, Mr.\nMalfoy. Did the speech of our dear Professor Quirrell cost you a\nfew allies?\"",
      "\"It was a clever enough slander of my abilities,\" Lucius said\ncoldly, \"though only effective upon the fools who believe that I\nwas truly a Death Eater.\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" blurted Neville.",
      "\"I was under the Imperius, young man,\" said Lucius, now\nsounding tired. \"The Dark Lord could hardly have begun recruiting\namong pureblood families without the support of House Malfoy. I\ndemurred, and he simply made sure of me. His own Death Eaters did\nnot know it until afterward, hence the false Mark I bear; though\nsince I did not truly consent, it does not bind me. Some of the\nDeath Eaters still believe I was foremost among their number, and\nfor the peace of this nation I let them believe it, to keep them\ncontrolled. But I was not such a fool as to support that ill-fated\nadventurer of my own choice -\"",
      "\"Ignore him,\" Madam Longbottom said, the instruction addressed\nto Harry as well as Neville. \"He must spend the rest of his life\npretending, for fear of your testimony under Veritaserum.\" Said\nwith malicious satisfaction.",
      "Lucius turned his back on her dismissively, and faced Harry\nagain. \"Will you request this harridan to depart, Mr.\nPotter?\u202f\"",
      "\"I think not,\" said Harry in a dry voice. \"I prefer to deal with\nthe part of House Malfoy that's my own age.\"",
      "There was a long pause, then. The grey eyes searched him.",
      "\"Of course...\" said Lucius slowly. \"I do feel the fool\nnow. This whole time you were just pretending to have no idea what\nwe were talking about.\"",
      "Harry met the gaze, and said nothing.",
      "Lucius raised his cane a few centimeters and struck it hard on\nthe ground.",
      "The world vanished in a pale haze, all sounds went quiet, there\nwas nothing in the universe but Harry and Lucius Malfoy and the\nsnake-headed cane.",
      "\"My son is my heart,\" said the senior Malfoy, \"the last\nworthwhile thing I have left in this world, and this I say to you\nin a spirit of friendship: if he were to come to harm, I would give\nmy life over to vengeance. But so long as my son does not\ncome to harm, I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors. And as\nyou have asked nothing more of me, I will ask nothing more of\nyou.\"",
      "Then the pale haze vanished, showing an outraged Madam\nLongbottom being blocked from moving forward by the senior Crabbe;\nher wand was in her hand, now.",
      "\"How dare you!\" she hissed.",
      "Lucius's dark robes swirled around him, and his white hair, as\nhe turned to the senior Goyle. \"We return to Malfoy Manor.\"",
      "There were three pops of Apparition, and they were gone.",
      "A silence followed.",
      "\"Dear heavens,\" said Madam Longbottom. \"What was that\nabout?\"",
      "Harry shrugged helplessly. Then he looked at Neville.",
      "There was sweat on Neville's forehead.",
      "\"Thank you very much, Neville,\" said Harry. \"Your help was\ngreatly appreciated, Neville. And now, Neville, I think you should\nsit down.\"",
      "\"Yes, General,\" said Neville, and instead of coming over to one\nof the other chairs near Harry, he semi-collapsed into a sitting\nposition on the pavement.",
      "\"You have wrought many changes in my grandson,\" said Madam\nLongbottom. \"I approve of some, but not others.\"",
      "\"Send me the list of which is which,\" said Harry. \"I'll see what\nI can do.\"",
      "Neville groaned, but said nothing.",
      "Madam Longbottom gave a chuckle. \"I shall, young man, thank\nyou.\" Her voice lowered. \"Mr. Potter... the speech given by\nProfessor Quirrell is something our nation has long needed to hear.\nI cannot say as much of your comment on it.\"",
      "\"I will take your opinion under advisement,\" Harry said\nmildly.",
      "\"I dearly hope that you do,\" said Madam Longbottom, and turned\nback to her grandson. \"Do I still need to -\"",
      "\"It's okay for you to go, Granma,\" said Neville. \"I'll be fine\non my own, this time.\"",
      "\"Now that I approve of,\" she said, and popped and\nvanished like a soap bubble.",
      "The two boys sat quietly for a moment.",
      "Neville spoke first, his voice weary. \"You're going to try to\nfix all the changes she approves of, right?\"",
      "\"Not all of them,\" Harry said innocently. \"I just want\nto make sure I'm not corrupting you.\"",
      "Draco looked very worried. His head kept darting\naround, despite the fact that Draco had insisted on them going down\ninto Harry's trunk, and using a true Quieting Charm and not just\nthe sound-blurring barrier.",
      "\"What did you say to Father?\" blurted Draco, the moment\nthe Quieting Charm went up and the sounds of Platform 9 3/4\nvanished.",
      "\"I... look, can you tell me what he said to you, before\nhe dropped you off?\" said Harry.",
      "\"That I should tell him right away if you seemed to be\nthreatening me,\" said Draco. \"That I should tell him right away if\nthere was anything I was doing that could pose a threat to\nyou! Father thinks you're dangerous, Harry,\nwhatever you said to him today it scared him! It's not\na good idea to scare Father!\u202f\"",
      "Oh, hell...",
      "\"What did you talk about?\" demanded Draco.",
      "Harry leaned back wearily in the small folding chair that sat at\nthe bottom of his trunk's cavern. \"You know, Draco, just as the\nfundamental question of rationality is 'What do I think I know and\nhow do I think I know it?', there's also a cardinal sin, a way of\nthinking that's the opposite of that. Like the ancient Greek\nphilosophers. They had no clue what was going on, so they'd go\naround saying things like 'All is water' or 'All is fire', and they\nnever asked themselves, 'Wait a minute, even if everything\nis water, how could I possibly know that?' They\ndidn't ask themselves if they had evidence which discriminated\nthat possibility from all the other possibilities\nyou could imagine, evidence they'd be very unlikely to encounter if\nthe theory wasn't true -\"",
      "\"Harry,\" Draco said, his voice strained, \"What did\nyou talk about with Father?\u202f\"",
      "\"I don't know, actually,\" said Harry, \"so it's very important\nthat I not just make stuff up -\"",
      "Harry had never heard Draco shriek in horror in quite that high\na pitch before."

      "Professor Flitwick had silently passed Harry a folded parchment\nduring Charms class that Monday, and the note had said that Harry\nwas to visit the Headmaster at his convenience and in such fashion\nthat no one else would notice, especially not Draco Malfoy or\nProfessor Quirrell. His one-time password for the gargoyle would be\n\"squeamish ossifrage\". This had been accompanied by a remarkably\nartistic ink drawing of Professor Flitwick staring at him sternly,\nthe eyes of which occasionally blinked; and at the bottom of the\nnote, underlined three times, was the phrase DON'T GET INTO\nTROUBLE.",
      "And so Harry had finished up Transfiguration class, and studied\nwith Hermione, and eaten dinner, and spoken with his lieutenants,\nand finally, when the clock struck nine, turned himself invisible\nand dropped back to 6PM and wearily trudged off toward the\ngargoyle, the turning spiral stairs, the wooden door, the room full\nof little fiddly things, and the silver-bearded figure of the\nHeadmaster.",
      "This time, Dumbledore looked quite serious, the customary smile\nabsent; and he was dressed in pajamas of a darker and more sober\npurple than usual.",
      "\"Thank you for coming, Harry,\" said the Headmaster. The old\nwizard rose from his throne, began to slowly pace through the room\nand the strange devices. \"First, do you have with you the notes of\nyesterday's encounter with Lucius Malfoy?\"",
      "\"Notes?\" blurted Harry.",
      "\"Surely you wrote it down...\" said the old wizard, and\nhis voice trailed off.",
      "Harry felt rather embarrassed. Yes, if you'd just fumbled\nthrough a mysterious conversation full of significant hints you\ndidn't understand, the bloody obvious thing to do would be\nto write it all down immediately afterward, before the memory\nfaded, so you could try to figure it out later.",
      "\"All right,\" said the Headmaster, \"from memory then.\"",
      "Harry sheepishly recited as best he could, and got almost\nhalfway through before he realized that it wasn't smart to just go\naround telling the possibly-crazy Headmaster everything, at least\nnot without thinking about it first, but then Lucius was\ndefinitely a bad guy and Dumbledore's opponent so it\nprobably was a good idea to tell him, and Harry had\nalready started talking and it was too late to try and calculate\nthings out now...",
      "Harry finished his recollections honestly.",
      "Dumbledore's face had grown more remote as Harry went on, and at\nthe end there was a look of ancientness about him, a sternness in\nthe air.",
      "\"Well,\" said Dumbledore. \"I suggest you take the best of care\nthat the heir of Malfoy does not come to harm, then. And I\nwill do the same.\" The Headmaster was frowning, his fingers\ndrumming soundlessly through the inky black surface of a plate\ninscribed with the word Leliel. \"And I think it would be\nmost extremely wise for you to avoid all interaction with\nLord Malfoy henceforth.\"",
      "\"Did you intercept owls from him to me?\" said\nHarry.",
      "The Headmaster gazed at Harry for a long moment, then\nreluctantly nodded.",
      "For some reason Harry wasn't feeling as outraged as he should\nhave been. Maybe it was just that Harry was finding it very easy to\nsympathize with the Headmaster's point of view right now. Even\nHarry could understand why Dumbledore wouldn't want him to interact\nwith Lucius Malfoy; it didn't seem like an evil deed.",
      "Not like the Headmaster blackmailing Zabini... for which they\nhad only Zabini's word, and Zabini was wildly untrustworthy, in\nfact it was hard to see why Zabini wouldn't just tell the\nstory that got him the most sympathy from Professor Quirrell...",
      "\"How about if, instead of protesting, I say that I understand\nyour point of view,\" said Harry, \"and you go on intercepting my\nowls, but you tell me who from?\"",
      "\"I have intercepted a great many owls to you, I am afraid,\"\nDumbledore said soberly. \"You are a celebrity, Harry, and you would\nreceive dozens of letters a day, some from far outside this\ncountry, did I not turn them back.\"",
      "\"That,\" Harry said, now starting to feel a bit of\nindignation, \"seems like going a little too far -\"",
      "\"Many of those letters,\" the old wizard said quietly, \"will be\nasking you for things you cannot give. I have not read them, of\ncourse, only turned them back to their senders undelivered. But I\nknow, for I receive them too. And you are too young, Harry, to have\nyour heart broken six times before breakfast each morning.\"",
      "Harry looked down at his shoes. He should insist on\nreading the letters and judging for himself, but... there was a\nsmall voice of common sense inside him, and it was screaming very\nloudly right now.",
      "\"Thank you,\" Harry muttered.",
      "\"The other reason I asked you here,\" said the old wizard, \"was\nthat I wished to consult your unique genius.\"",
      "\"Transfiguration?\" said Harry, surprised and flattered.",
      "\"No, not that unique genius,\" said Dumbledore. \"Tell\nme, Harry, what evil could you accomplish if a Dementor were\nallowed onto the grounds of Hogwarts?\"",
      "It developed that Professor Quirrell had asked, or rather\ndemanded, that his students test their skills against an actual\nDementor after they learned the words and gestures to the Patronus\nCharm.",
      "\"Professor Quirrell is unable to cast the Patronus Charm\nhimself,\" said Dumbledore, as he paced slowly through the devices.\n\"Which is never a good sign. But then, he volunteered that\nfact to me in the course of demanding that outside instructors be\nbrought in to teach the Patronus Charm to every student who wished\nto learn; he offered to pay the expense himself, if I would not.\nThis impressed me greatly. But now he insists on bringing in a\nDementor -\"",
      "\"Headmaster,\" Harry said quietly, \"Professor Quirrell believes\nvery strongly in live-fire tests under realistic combat\nconditions. Wanting to bring in an actual Dementor is\ncompletely in character for him.\"",
      "Now the Headmaster was giving Harry a strange look.",
      "\"In character?\u202f\" said the old wizard.",
      "\"I mean,\" said Harry, \"it's entirely consistent with the way\nProfessor Quirrell usually acts...\" Harry trailed off. Why\nhad he put it that way?",
      "The Headmaster nodded. \"So you have the same sense I do; that it\nis an excuse. A very reasonable excuse, to be sure; more\nso than you may realize. Often, wizards seemingly unable to cast a\nPatronus Charm will succeed in the presence of an actual Dementor,\ngoing from not a single flicker of light to a full corporeal\nPatronus. Why this should be, no one knows; but it is so.\"",
      "Harry frowned. \"Then I really don't see why you're suspicious\n-\"",
      "The Headmaster spread his hands as though in helplessness.\n\"Harry, the Defense Professor has asked me to pass the\ndarkest of all creatures through the gates of Hogwarts. I\nmust be suspicious.\" The Headmaster sighed. \"And yet the\nDementor will be guarded, warded, in a mighty cage, I will be there\nmyself to watch it at all times - I cannot think of what ill\ncould be done. But perhaps I am merely unable to see it.\nAnd so I am asking you.\"",
      "Harry stared at the Headmaster with his mouth open. He was so\nshocked he couldn't even feel flattered.",
      "\"Me?\u202f\" said Harry.",
      "\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore, smiling slightly. \"I try my best to\nanticipate my foes, to encompass their wicked minds and predict\ntheir evil thoughts. But I would never have imagined\nsharpening a Hufflepuff's bones into weapons.\"",
      "Was Harry ever going to live that down?",
      "\"Headmaster,\" Harry said wearily, \"I know it doesn't sound good,\nbut in all seriousness: I'm not evil, I'm just very creative -\"",
      "\"I did not say that you were evil,\" Dumbledore said seriously.\n\"There are those who say that to comprehend evil is to become evil;\nbut they are merely pretending to be wise. Rather it is evil which\ndoes not know love, and dares not imagine love, and cannot ever\nunderstand love without ceasing to be evil. And I suspect that you\ncan imagine your way into the minds of Dark Wizards better than I\never could, while still knowing love yourself. So, Harry.\" The\nHeadmaster's eyes were intent. \"If you stood in Professor\nQuirrell's shoes, what misdeeds could you accomplish after you\ntricked me into allowing a Dementor onto the grounds of\nHogwarts?\"",
      "\"Hold on,\" said Harry, and in something of a daze\ntrudged over to the chair in front of the Headmaster's desk, and\nsat down. It was a large and comfortable chair this time, not a\nwooden stool, and Harry could feel himself enveloped as he sank\ninto it.",
      "Dumbledore was asking him to outwit Professor Quirrell.",
      "Point one: Harry was rather fonder of Professor Quirrell than of\nDumbledore.",
      "Point two: The hypothesis was that the Defense Professor was\nplanning to do something evil, and in that subjunctive case, Harry\nought to be helping the Headmaster prevent it.",
      "Point three...",
      "\"Headmaster,\" Harry said, \"if Professor Quirrell is up\nto something, I'm not sure I can outwit him. He's got a\nlot more experience than I do.\"",
      "The old wizard shook his head, somehow managing to appear very\nsolemn despite his smile. \"You underestimate yourself.\"",
      "That was the first time anyone had ever said that to\nHarry.",
      "\"I remember,\" the old wizard continued, \"a young man in this\nvery office, cold and controlled as he faced down the Head of House\nSlytherin, blackmailing his own Headmaster to protect his\nclassmates. And I believe that young man is more cunning than\nProfessor Quirrell, more cunning than Lucius Malfoy, that he will\ngrow to be the equal of Voldemort himself. It is he who I wish to\nconsult.\"",
      "Harry suppressed the chill that went through him at the name,\nfrowned thoughtfully at the Headmaster.",
      "How much does he know...?",
      "The Headmaster had seen Harry in the grip of his mysterious dark\nside, as deep as Harry had ever sunk into it. Harry still\nremembered what it had been like to watch, invisibly Time-Turned,\nas his past self faced down the older Slytherins; the boy with the\nscar on his forehead who didn't act like the others. Of\ncourse the Headmaster would have noticed something odd about\nthe boy in his office...",
      "And Dumbledore had concluded that his pet hero had cunning to\nmatch his destined foe, the Dark Lord.",
      "Which wasn't asking for very much, considering that the Dark\nLord had put a clearly visible Dark Mark on all of his servants'\nleft arms, and that he'd slaughtered the entire monastery that\ntaught the martial art he'd wanted to learn.",
      "Enough cunning to match Professor Quirrell would be a\nwhole different order of problem.",
      "But it was also clear that the Headmaster wouldn't be satisfied\nuntil Harry went all cold and darkish, and came up with some sort\nof answer that sounded impressively cunning... which had better not\nactually get in the way of Professor Quirrell's teaching\nDefense...",
      "And of course Harry would go over to his dark side and\nthink it through from that direction, just to be honest, and just\nin case.",
      "\"Tell me,\" Harry said, \"everything about how the Dementor is to\nbe brought in, and how it is to be guarded.\"",
      "Dumbledore's eyebrows rose for a moment, and then the old wizard\nbegan to speak.",
      "The Dementor would be transported to the grounds of Hogwarts by\nan Auror trio, all three personally known to the Headmaster, and\nall three able to cast a corporeal Patronus Charm. They would be\nmet at the edge of the grounds by Dumbledore, who would pass the\nDementor through the Hogwarts wards -",
      "Harry asked if the pass was permanent or temporary - whether\nsomeone could just bring in the same Dementor again the next\nday.",
      "The pass was temporary (replied the Headmaster with an approving\nnod), and the explanation went on: The Dementor would be in a cage\nof solid titanium bars, not Transfigured but true-forged; in time a\nDementor's presence would corrode that metal to dust, but not in a\nsingle day.",
      "Students awaiting their turn would stay well back of the\nDementor, behind two corporeal Patronuses maintained by two of the\nthree Aurors at any given time. Dumbledore would wait by the\nDementor's cage with his Patronus. A single student would approach\nthe Dementor; and Dumbledore would dispel his Patronus; and the\nstudent would attempt to cast their own Patronus Charm; and if they\nfailed, Dumbledore would restore his Patronus before the student\ncould suffer any permanent damage. Past dueling champion Professor\nFlitwick would also be present while there were students near, just\nto add safety margin.",
      "\"Why just you waiting by the Dementor?\" said Harry. \"I\nmean, shouldn't it be you plus an Auror -\"",
      "The Headmaster shook his head. \"They could not withstand the\nrepeated exposure to the Dementor, each time I dispel my\nPatronus.\"",
      "And if Dumbledore's Patronus did fail for some reason, while one\nof the students was still near the Dementor, the third Auror would\ncast another corporeal Patronus and send it to shield the\nstudent...",
      "Harry poked and prodded, but he couldn't see a flaw in the\nsecurity.",
      "So Harry took a deep breath, sank further into the chair, closed\nhis eyes, and remembered:",
      "\"And that will be... five points? No, let us make it an even\nten points from Ravenclaw for backchat.\"",
      "The cold came more slowly now, more reluctantly, Harry hadn't\nbeen calling much on his dark side lately...",
      "Harry had to run through that entire session in Potions in his\nmind, before his blood chilled into something approaching deadly\ncrystalline clarity.",
      "And then he thought of the Dementor.",
      "And it was obvious.",
      "\"The Dementor is a distraction,\" Harry said. The coldness clear\nin his voice, since that was what Dumbledore wanted and expected.\n\"A large, salient threat, but in the end straightforward, and easy\nto defend against. So while all your attention is focused on the\nDementor, the real plot will be happening elsewhere.\"",
      "Dumbledore stared at Harry for a moment, and then gave a slow\nnod. \"Yes...\" said the Headmaster. \"And I do believe I know what it\nmight be a distraction from, if Professor Quirrell means\nill... thank you, Harry.\"",
      "The Headmaster was still staring at Harry, a strange look in\nthose ancient eyes.",
      "\"What?\u202f\" said Harry with a tinge of annoyance, the cold\nstill lingering in his blood.",
      "\"I have another question for that young man,\" said the\nHeadmaster. \"It is something I have long wondered to myself, yet\nbeen unable to comprehend. Why?\u202f\" There was a tinge of\npain in his voice. \"Why would anyone deliberately make himself a\nmonster? Why do evil for the sake of evil? Why Voldemort?\"",
      "Whirr, bzzzt, tick; ding, puff, splat...",
      "Harry stared at the Headmaster in surprise.",
      "\"How would I know?\" said Harry. \"Am I supposed to\nmagically understand the Dark Lord because I'm the hero, or\nsomething?\"",
      "\"Yes!\u202f\" said Dumbledore. \"My own great foe was\nGrindelwald, and him I understood very well indeed.\nGrindelwald was my dark mirror, the man I could so easily have\nbeen, had I given in to the temptation to believe that I was a good\nperson, and therefore always in the right. For the greater\ngood, that was his slogan; and he truly believed it himself,\neven as he tore at all Europe like a wounded animal. And him, I\ndefeated in the end. But then after him came Voldemort, to destroy\neverything I had protected in Britain.\" The hurt was plain now in\nDumbledore's voice, exposed upon his face. \"He committed acts worse\nby far than Grindelwald's worst, horror for the sake of horror. I\nsacrificed everything only to hold him back, and I still don't\nunderstand why! Why, Harry? Why did he do it? He\nwas never my destined foe, but yours, so if you have any guesses at\nall, Harry, please tell me! Why?\u202f\"",
      "Harry stared down at his hands. The truth was that Harry hadn't\nread up on the Dark Lord yet, and right now he hadn't the tiniest\nclue. And somehow that didn't seem like an answer the Headmaster\nwanted to hear. \"Too many Dark rituals, maybe? In the beginning he\nthought he'd do just one, but it sacrificed part of his good side,\nand that made him less reluctant to perform other Dark rituals, so\nhe did more and more rituals in a positive feedback cycle until he\nended up as a tremendously powerful monster -\"",
      "\"No!\" Now the Headmaster's voice was agonized. \"I can't believe\nthat, Harry! There has to be something more to it than just\nthat!\"",
      "Why should there be? thought Harry, but he didn't say\nit, because it was clear that the Headmaster thought the universe\nwas a story and had a plot, and that huge tragedies weren't allowed\nto happen except for equally huge, significant reasons. \"I'm sorry,\nHeadmaster. The Dark Lord doesn't seem like much of a dark mirror\nto me, not at all. There isn't anything I find even the\ntiniest bit tempting about nailing the skins of Yermy\nWibble's family to a newsroom wall.\"",
      "\"Have you no wisdom to share?\" said Dumbledore. There\nwas pleading in the old wizard's voice, almost begging.",
      "Evil happens, thought Harry, it doesn't mean\nanything or teach us anything, except to not be evil? The Dark Lord\nwas probably just a selfish bastard who didn't care who he hurt, or\nan idiot who made stupidly avoidable mistakes that snowballed.\nThere is no destiny behind the ills of this world; if Hitler had\nbeen allowed into architecture school like he wanted, the whole\nhistory of Europe would have been different; if we lived in the\nsort of universe where horrible things were only allowed to happen\nfor good reasons, they just wouldn't happen in the first\nplace.",
      "And none of that, obviously, was what the Headmaster wanted to\nhear.",
      "The old wizard was still looking at Harry from over a fiddly\nthing like a frozen puff of smoke, a painful desperation in those\nancient, waiting eyes.",
      "Well, sounding wise wasn't difficult. It was a lot easier than\nbeing intelligent, actually, since you didn't have to say anything\nsurprising or come up with any new insights. You just let your\nbrain's pattern-matching software complete the cliche, using\nwhatever Deep Wisdom you'd stored previously.",
      "\"Headmaster,\" Harry said solemnly, \"I would rather not define\nmyself by my enemies.\"",
      "Somehow, even in the midst of all the whirring and ticking,\nthere was a kind of silence.",
      "That had come out a bit more Deeply Wise than Harry had\nintended.",
      "\"You may be very wise, Harry...\" the Headmaster said slowly. \"I\ndo wish... that I could have been defined by my friends.\" The pain\nin his voice had grown deeper.",
      "Harry's mind searched hastily for something else Deeply Wise to\nsay that would soften the unintended force of the blow -",
      "\"Or perhaps,\" Harry said more softly, \"it is the foe that makes\nthe Gryffindor, as it is the friend that makes the Hufflepuff, and\nthe ambition that makes the Slytherin. I do know that it is always,\nin every generation, the puzzle that makes the scientist.\"",
      "\"It is a dreadful fate to which you condemn my House, Harry,\"\nsaid the Headmaster. The pain was still in his voice. \"For now that\nyou remark on it, I do think that I was very much made by my\nenemies.\"",
      "Harry stared at his own hands, where they lay in his lap. Maybe\nhe should just shut up while he was ahead.",
      "\"But you have answered my question,\" said Dumbledore\nmore softly, as though to himself. \"I should have realized that\nwould be a Slytherin's key. For his ambition, all for the sake of\nhis ambition; and that I know, though not why...\"\nFor a time Dumbledore stared off into nothingness; then he\nstraightened, and his eyes seemed to focus on Harry again.",
      "\"And you, Harry,\" said the Headmaster, \"you name yourself a\nscientist?\u202f\" His voice was laced with surprise and mild\ndisapproval.",
      "\"You don't like science?\" said Harry a little wearily. He'd\nhoped Dumbledore would be fonder of Muggle things.",
      "\"I suppose it is useful to those without wands,\" said\nDumbledore, frowning. \"But it seems a strange thing by which to\ndefine yourself. Is science as important as love? As kindness? As\nfriendship? Is it science that makes you fond of Minerva\nMcGonagall? Is it science that makes you care for Hermione Granger?\nWill it be science to which you turn, when you try to kindle warmth\nin Draco Malfoy's heart?\"",
      "You know, the sad thing is, you probably think you just\nuttered some kind of incredibly wise knockdown argument.",
      "Now, how to phrase the rejoinder in such fashion that it also\nsounded incredibly wise...",
      "\"You are not Ravenclaw,\" Harry said with calm dignity, \"and so\nit might not have occurred to you that to respect the truth, and\nseek it all the days of your life, could also be an act of\ngrace.\"",
      "The Headmaster's eyebrows rose up. And then he sighed. \"How did\nyou become so wise, so young...?\" The old wizard sounded sad, as he\nsaid it. \"Perhaps it will prove valuable to you.\"",
      "Only for impressing ancient wizards who are overly impressed\nwith themselves, thought Harry. He was actually a bit\ndisappointed by Dumbledore's credulity; it wasn't that Harry had\nlied, but Dumbledore seemed far too impressed with Harry's\nability to phrase things so that they sounded profound, instead of\nputting them into plain English like Richard Feynman had done with\nhis wisdom...",
      "\"Love is more important than wisdom,\" said Harry, just to test\nthe limits of Dumbledore's tolerance for blindingly obvious cliches\ncompleted by sheer pattern matching without any sort of detailed\nanalysis.",
      "The Headmaster nodded gravely, and said, \"Indeed.\"",
      "Harry stood up out of the chair, and stretched his arms.\nWell, I'd better go off and love something, then, that's bound\nto help me defeat the Dark Lord. And next time you ask me for\nadvice, I'll just give you a hug -",
      "\"This day you have helped me much, Harry,\" said the Headmaster.\n\"And so there is one last thing I would ask that young man.\"",
      "Great.",
      "\"Tell me, Harry,\" said the Headmaster (and now his voice sounded\nsimply puzzled, though there was still a hint of pain in his eyes),\n\"why do Dark Wizards fear death so greatly?\"",
      "\"Er,\" said Harry, \"sorry, I've got to back the Dark Wizards on\nthat one.\"",
      "Whoosh, hiss, chime; glorp, pop, bubble -",
      "\"What?\u202f\" said Dumbledore.",
      "\"Death is bad,\" said Harry, discarding wisdom for the sake of\nclear communication. \"Very bad. Extremely bad. Being scared of\ndeath is like being scared of a great big monster with poisonous\nfangs. It actually makes a great deal of sense, and does not, in\nfact, indicate that you have a psychological problem.\"",
      "The Headmaster was staring at him as though he'd just turned\ninto a cat.",
      "\"Okay,\" said Harry, \"let me put it this way. Do you\nwant to die? Because if so, there's this Muggle thing\ncalled a suicide prevention hotline -\"",
      "\"When it is time,\" the old wizard said quietly. \"Not before. I\nwould never seek to hasten the day, nor seek to refuse it when it\ncomes.\"",
      "Harry was frowning sternly. \"That doesn't sound like you have a\nvery strong will to live, Headmaster!\"",
      "\"Harry...\" The old wizard's voice was starting to sound a little\nhelpless; and he had paced to a spot where his silver beard,\nunnoticed, had drifted into a crystalline glass goldfish bowl, and\nwas slowly taking on a greenish tinge that crept up the hairs. \"I\nthink I may have not made myself clear. Dark Wizards are not eager\nto live. They fear death. They do not reach up toward the\nsun's light, but flee the coming of night into infinitely darker\ncaverns of their own making, without moon or stars. It is not life\nthey desire, but immortality; and they are so driven to\ngrasp at it that they will sacrifice their very souls! Do you want\nto live forever, Harry?\"",
      "\"Yes, and so do you,\" said Harry. \"I want to live one more day.\nTomorrow I will still want to live one more day. Therefore I want\nto live forever, proof by induction on the positive integers. If\nyou don't want to die, it means you want to live forever. If you\ndon't want to live forever, it means you want to die. You've got to\ndo one or the other... I'm not getting through here, am I.\"",
      "The two cultures stared at each other across a vast gap of\nincommensurability.",
      "\"I have lived a hundred and ten years,\" the old wizard said\nquietly (taking his beard out of the bowl, and jiggling it to shake\nout the color). \"I have seen and done a great many things, too many\nof which I wish I had never seen or done. And yet I do not regret\nbeing alive, for watching my students grow is a joy that has not\nbegun to wear on me. But I would not wish to live so long that it\ndoes! What would you do with eternity, Harry?\"",
      "Harry took a deep breath. \"Meet all the interesting people in\nthe world, read all the good books and then write something even\nbetter, celebrate my first grandchild's tenth birthday party on the\nMoon, celebrate my first great-great-great grandchild's hundredth\nbirthday party around the Rings of Saturn, learn the deepest and\nfinal rules of Nature, understand the nature of consciousness, find\nout why anything exists in the first place, visit other stars,\ndiscover aliens, create aliens, rendezvous with everyone for a\nparty on the other side of the Milky Way once we've explored the\nwhole thing, meet up with everyone else who was born on Old Earth\nto watch the Sun finally go out, and I used to worry about finding\na way to escape this universe before it ran out of negentropy but\nI'm a lot more hopeful now that I've discovered the so-called laws\nof physics are just optional guidelines.\"",
      "\"I did not understand much of that,\" said Dumbledore. \"But I\nmust ask if these are things that you truly desire so desperately,\nor if you only imagine them so as to imagine not being tired, as\nyou run and run from death.\"",
      "\"Life is not a finite list of things that you check off before\nyou're allowed to die,\" Harry said firmly. \"It's life, you just go\non living it. If I'm not doing those things it'll be because I've\nfound something better.\"",
      "Dumbledore sighed. His fingers drummed on a clock; as they\ntouched it, the numerals changed to an indecipherable script, and\nthe hands briefly appeared in different positions. \"In the unlikely\nevent that I am permitted to tarry until a hundred and fifty,\" said\nthe old wizard, \"I do not think I would mind. But two hundred years\nwould be entirely too much of a good thing.\"",
      "\"Yes, well,\" Harry said, his voice a little dry as he thought of\nhis Mum and Dad and their allotted span if Harry didn't do\nsomething about it, \"I suspect, Headmaster, that if you came from a\nculture where people were accustomed to living four hundred years,\nthat dying at two hundred would seem just as tragically premature\nas dying at, say, eighty.\" Harry's voice went hard, on\nthat last word.",
      "\"Perhaps,\" the old wizard said peacefully. \"I would not wish to\ndie before my friends, nor live on after they had all gone. The\nhardest time is when those you loved the most have gone on before\nyou, and yet others still live, for whose sake you must stay...\"\nDumbledore's eyes were fixed on Harry, and growing sad. \"Do not\nmourn me too greatly, Harry, when my time comes; I will be with\nthose I have long missed, on our next great adventure.\"",
      "\"Oh!\" Harry said in sudden realization. \"You believe in an\nafterlife. I got the impression wizards didn't have\nreligion?\"",
      "Toot. Beep. Thud.",
      "\"How can you not believe it?\u202f\" said the Headmaster,\nlooking completely flabbergasted. \"Harry, you're a wizard!\nYou've seen ghosts!\u202f\"",
      "\"Ghosts,\" Harry said, his voice flat. \"You mean those things\nlike portraits, stored memories and behaviors with no awareness or\nlife, accidentally impressed into the surrounding material by the\nburst of magic that accompanies the violent death of a wizard\n-\"",
      "\"I've heard that theory,\" said the Headmaster, his voice growing\nsharp, \"repeated by wizards who mistake cynicism for wisdom, who\nthink that to look down upon others is to elevate themselves. It is\none of the silliest ideas I have heard in a hundred and ten years!\nYes, ghosts do not learn or grow, because this is not\nwhere they belong! Souls are meant to move on, there is no\nlife remaining for them here! And if not ghosts, then what\nof the Veil? What of the Resurrection Stone?\"",
      "\"All right,\" Harry said, trying to keep his voice calm, \"I'll\nhear out your evidence, because that's what a scientist\ndoes. But first, Headmaster, let me tell you a little story.\"\nHarry's voice was trembling. \"You know, when I got here, when I got\noff the train from King's Cross, I don't mean yesterday but back in\nSeptember, when I got off the train then, Headmaster, I'd never\nseen a ghost. I wasn't expecting ghosts. So when I saw\nthem, Headmaster, I did something really dumb. I jumped to\nconclusions. I, I thought there was an afterlife, I\nthought no one had ever really died, I thought that everyone the\nhuman species had ever lost was really fine after all, I thought\nthat wizards could talk to people who'd passed on, that it just\ntook the right spell to summon them, that wizards could do\nthat, I thought I could meet my parents who died for me, and tell\nthem that I'd heard about their sacrifice and that I'd begun to\ncall them my mother and father -\"",
      "\"Harry,\" whispered Dumbledore. Water glittered in the old\nwizard's eyes. He took a step closer across the office -",
      "\"And then,\" spat Harry, the fury coming fully into his\nvoice, the cold rage at the universe for being like that and at\nhimself for being so stupid, \"I asked Hermione and she said that\nthey were just afterimages, burned into the stone of the\ncastle by the death of a wizard, like the silhouettes left on the\nwalls of Hiroshima. And I should have known! I should have known\nwithout even having to ask! I shouldn't have believed it even for\nall of thirty seconds! Because if people had souls there wouldn't\nbe any such thing as brain damage, if your soul could go on\nspeaking after your whole brain was gone, how could damage to the\nleft cerebral hemisphere take away your ability to talk? And\nProfessor McGonagall, when she told me about how my parents had\ndied, she didn't act like they'd just gone away on a long trip to\nanother country, like they'd emigrated to Australia back in the\ndays of sailing ships, which is the way people would act if they\nactually knew that death was just going somewhere else, if\nthey had hard evidence for an afterlife, instead of making stuff up\nto console themselves, it would change everything, it\nwouldn't matter that everyone had lost someone in the war,\nit would be a little sad but not horrible! And I'd already\nseen that people in the wizarding world didn't act like that! So I\nshould have known better! And that was when I knew that my parents\nwere really dead and gone forever and ever, that there wasn't\nanything left of them, that I'd never get a chance to meet them\nand, and, and the other children thought I was crying because I was\nscared of ghosts -\"",
      "The old wizard's face was horrified, he opened his mouth to\nspeak -",
      "\"So tell me, Headmaster! Tell me about the evidence! But\ndon't you dare exaggerate a single tiny bit of it, because\nif you give me false hope again, and I find out later that you lied\nor stretched things just a little, I won't ever forgive you for it!\nWhat's the Veil?\u202f\"",
      "Harry reached up and wiped at his cheeks, while the glass things\nof the office stopped vibrating from his last shriek.",
      "\"The Veil,\" said the old wizard with only a slight tremble in\nhis voice, \"is a great stone archway, kept in the Department of\nMysteries; a gateway to the land of the dead.\"",
      "\"And how does anyone know that?\" said Harry. \"Don't tell me what\nyou believe, tell me what you've seen!\u202f\"",
      "The physical manifestation of the barrier between worlds was a\ngreat stone archway, old and tall and coming to a sharp point, with\na tattered black veil like the surface of a pool of water,\nstretched between the stones; rippling, always, from the constant\nand one-way passage of the souls. If you stood by the Veil you\ncould hear the voices of the dead calling, always calling in\nwhispers barely on the wrong side of comprehension, growing louder\nand more numerous if you stayed and tried to hear, as they tried to\ncommunicate; and if you listened too long, you would go to meet\nthem, and in the moment you touched the Veil you would be sucked\nthrough, and never be heard from again.",
      "\"That doesn't even sound like an interesting fraud,\"\nHarry said, his voice calmer now that there was nothing there to\nmake him hope, or make him angry for having hopes dashed. \"Someone\nbuilt a stone archway, made a little black rippling surface between\nit that Vanished anything it touched, and enchanted it to whisper\nto people and hypnotize them.\"",
      "\"Harry...\" the Headmaster said, starting to look rather worried.\n\"I can tell you the truth, but if you refuse to hear it...\"",
      "Also not interesting. \"What's the Resurrection\nStone?\"",
      "\"I would not tell you,\" the Headmaster said slowly, \"save that I\nfear what this disbelief may do to you... so listen, then, Harry,\nplease listen...\"",
      "The Resurrection Stone was one of the three legendary Deathly\nHallows, kin to Harry's cloak. The Resurrection Stone could call\nsouls back from the dead - bring them back into the world of the\nliving, though not as they were. Cadmus Peverell used the stone to\ncall back his lost beloved from the dead, but her heart stayed with\nthe dead, and not in the world of the living. And in time it drove\nhim mad, and he killed himself to be truly with her once\nmore...",
      "In all politeness, Harry raised his hand.",
      "\"Yes?\" the Headmaster said reluctantly.",
      "\"The obvious test to see if the Resurrection Stone is\nreally calling back the dead, or just projecting an image\nfrom the user's mind, is to ask a question whose answer\nyou don't know, but the dead person would, and\nthat can be definitely verified in this world. For example, call\nback -\"",
      "Then Harry paused, because this time he'd managed to\nthink it through one step ahead of his tongue, fast enough to\nnot say the first name and test that had sprung to\nmind.",
      "\"...your dead wife, and ask her where she left her lost earring,\nor something like that,\" Harry finished. \"Did anyone do any tests\nlike that?\"",
      "\"The Resurrection Stone has been lost for centuries, Harry,\" the\nHeadmaster said quietly.",
      "Harry shrugged. \"Well, I'm a scientist, and I'm always willing\nto be convinced. If you really believe the Resurrection\nStone calls back the dead - then you must believe a test like that\nwill succeed, right? So do you know anything about where to find\nthe Resurrection Stone? I got one Deathly Hallow already\nunder highly mysterious circumstances, and, well, we both know how\nthe rhythm of the world works on that sort of thing.\"",
      "Dumbledore stared at Harry.",
      "Harry gazed equably back at the Headmaster.",
      "The old wizard passed a hand across his forehead and muttered,\n\"This is madness.\"",
      "(Somehow, Harry managed to stop himself from laughing.)",
      "And Dumbledore told Harry to draw forth the Cloak of\nInvisibility from his pouch; at the Headmaster's direction, Harry\nstared at the inside and back of the hood until he saw it, faintly\ndrawn against the silvery mesh in faded scarlet like dried blood,\nthe symbol of the Deathly Hallows: a triangle, with a circle drawn\ninside, and a line dividing them both.",
      "\"Thank you,\" Harry said politely. \"I shall be sure to keep an\neye out for a stone so marked. Do you have any other evidence?\"",
      "Dumbledore appeared to be fighting a struggle within himself.\n\"Harry,\" the old wizard said, his voice rising, \"this is a\ndangerous road you are walking, I am not sure I do the right thing\nby saying this, but I must wrench you from this way!\nHarry, how could Voldemort have survived the death of his body\nif he did not have a soul?\u202f\"",
      "And that was when Harry realized that there was exactly\none person who'd originally told Professor McGonagall that\nthe Dark Lord was still alive in the first place; and it was the\ncrazy Headmaster of their madhouse of a school, who thought the\nworld ran on cliches.",
      "\"Good question,\" Harry said, after some internal debate about\nhow to proceed. \"Maybe he found some way of duplicating the power\nof the Resurrection Stone, only he loaded it in advance with a\ncomplete copy of his brain state. Or something like that.\"\nHarry was suddenly far from sure that he was trying to come up with\nan explanation for something that had actually happened.\n\"Actually, can you just go ahead and tell me everything you know\nabout how the Dark Lord survived and what it might take to kill\nhim?\" If he even still exists as more than Quibbler\nheadlines.",
      "\"You are not fooling me, Harry,\" said the old wizard; his face\nlooked ancient now, and lined by more than years. \"I know why you\nare truly asking that question. No, I do not read your mind, I do\nnot have to, your hesitation gives you away! You seek the secret of\nthe Dark Lord's immortality in order to use it for yourself!\"",
      "\"Wrong! I want the secret of the Dark Lord's immortality in\norder to use it for everyone!\u202f\"",
      "Tick, crackle, fzzzt...",
      "Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore just stood there and\nstared at Harry with his mouth gaping open dumbly.",
      "(Harry awarded himself a tally mark for Monday, since he'd\nmanaged to blow someone's mind completely before the day was\nover.)",
      "\"And in case it wasn't clear,\" said Harry, \"by everyone\nI mean all Muggles too, not just all wizards.\"",
      "\"No,\" said the old wizard, shaking his head. His voice rose.\n\"No, no, no! This is insanity!\u202f\"",
      "\"Bwa ha ha!\" said Harry.",
      "The old wizard's face was tight with anger and worry. \"Voldemort\nstole the book from which he gleaned his secret; it was not there\nwhen I went to look for it. But this much I know, and this much I\nwill tell you: his immortality was born of a ritual terrible and\nDark, blacker than pitchest black! And it was Myrtle, poor sweet\nMyrtle, who died for it; his immortality took sacrifice, it took\nmurder -\"",
      "\"Well obviously I'm not going to popularize a method of\nimmortality that requires killing people! That would defeat the\nentire point!\u202f\"",
      "There was a startled pause.",
      "Slowly the old wizard's face relaxed out of its anger, though\nthe worry was still there. \"You would use no ritual requiring human\nsacrifice.\"",
      "\"I don't know what you take me for, Headmaster,\" Harry\nsaid coldly, his own anger rising, \"but let's not forget that\nI'm the one who wants people to live! The one who\nwants to save everyone! You're the one who thinks\ndeath is awesome and everyone ought to die!\"",
      "\"I am at a loss, Harry,\" said the old wizard. His feet once more\nbegan trudging across his strange office. \"I know not what to say.\"\nHe picked up a crystal ball that seemed to hold a hand in flames,\nlooked into it with a sad expression. \"Only that I am greatly\nmisunderstood by you... I don't want everyone to die,\nHarry!\"",
      "\"You just don't want anyone to be immortal,\" Harry said with\nconsiderable irony. It seemed that elementary logical tautologies\nlike All x: Die(x) = Not Exist x: Not Die(x) were beyond\nthe reasoning abilities of the world's most powerful wizard.",
      "The old wizard nodded. \"I am less afraid than I was, but still\ngreatly worried for you, Harry,\" he said quietly. His hand, a\nlittle wizened by time, but still strong, placed the crystal ball\nfirmly back into its stand. \"For the fear of death is a bitter\nthing, an illness of the soul by which people are twisted and\nwarped. Voldemort is not the only Dark Wizard to go down that bleak\nroad, though I fear he has taken it further than any before\nhim.\"",
      "\"And you think you're not afraid of death?\" Harry said,\nnot even trying to mask the incredulity in his voice.",
      "The old wizard's face was peaceful. \"I am not perfect, Harry,\nbut I think I have accepted my death as part of myself.\"",
      "\"Uh huh,\" Harry said. \"See, there's this little thing called\ncognitive dissonance, or in plainer English, sour\ngrapes. If people were hit on the heads with truncheons once a\nmonth, and no one could do anything about it, pretty soon there'd\nbe all sorts of philosophers, pretending to be wise as you\nput it, who found all sorts of amazing benefits to being\nhit on the head with a truncheon once a month. Like, it makes you\ntougher, or it makes you happier on the days when you're\nnot getting hit with a truncheon. But if you went up to\nsomeone who wasn't getting hit, and you asked them if they\nwanted to start, in exchange for those amazing\nbenefits, they'd say no. And if you didn't have to\ndie, if you came from somewhere that no one had ever even\nheard of death, and I suggested to you that it would be an\namazing wonderful great idea for people to get wrinkled\nand old and eventually cease to exist, why, you'd have me hauled\nright off to a lunatic asylum! So why would anyone possibly think\nany thought so silly as that death is a good thing?\nBecause you're afraid of it, because you don't really want\nto die, and that thought hurts so much inside you that you have to\nrationalize it away, do something to numb the pain, so you won't\nhave to think about it -\"",
      "\"No, Harry,\" the old wizard said. His face was gentle, his hand\ntrailed through a lighted pool of water that made small musical\nchimes as his fingers stirred it. \"Though I can understand how you\nmust think so.\"",
      "\"Do you want to understand the Dark Wizard?\" Harry said, his\nvoice now hard and grim. \"Then look within the part of yourself\nthat flees not from death but from the fear of death, that\nfinds that fear so unbearable that it will embrace Death as a\nfriend and cozen up to it, try to become one with the night so that\nit can think itself master of the abyss. You have taken the most\nterrible of all evils and called it good! With only a slight twist\nthat same part of yourself would murder innocents, and call it\nfriendship. If you can call death better than life then you can\ntwist your moral compass to point anywhere -\"",
      "\"I think,\" said Dumbledore, shaking water droplets from his hand\nto the sound of tiny tinkling bells, \"that you understand Dark\nWizards very well, without yet being one yourself.\" It was\nsaid in perfect seriousness, and without accusation. \"But your\ncomprehension of me, I fear, is sorely lacking.\" The old\nwizard was smiling now, and there was a gentle laughter in his\nvoice.",
      "Harry was trying not to go any colder than he already was; from\nsomewhere there was pouring into his mind a blazing fury of\nresentment, at Dumbledore's condescension, and all the laughter\nthat wise old fools had ever used in place of argument. \"Funny\nthing, you know, I thought Draco Malfoy was going to be this\nimpossible to talk to, and instead, in his childish innocence, he\nwas a hundred times stronger than you.\"",
      "A look of puzzlement crossed the old wizard's face. \"What do you\nmean?\"",
      "\"I mean,\" Harry said, his voice biting, \"that Draco actually\ntook his own beliefs seriously and processed my\nwords instead of throwing them out the window by smiling\nwith gentle superiority. You're so old and wise, you can't even\nnotice anything I'm saying! Not understand,\nnotice!\u202f\"",
      "\"I have listened to you, Harry,\" said Dumbledore,\nlooking more solemn now, \"but to listen is not always to agree.\nDisagreements aside, what is it that you think I do not\ncomprehend?\"",
      "That if you really believed in an afterlife, you'd\ngo down to St. Mungo's and kill Neville's parents, Alice and Frank\nLongbottom, so they could go on to their next great\nadventure, instead of letting them linger here in their damaged\nstate -",
      "Harry barely, barely kept himself from saying it out\nloud.",
      "\"All right,\" Harry said coldly. \"I'll answer your original\nquestion, then. You asked why Dark Wizards are afraid of death.\nPretend, Headmaster, that you really believed in souls.\nPretend that anyone could verify the existence of souls at any\ntime, pretend that nobody cried at funerals because they\nknew their loved ones were still alive. Now can you\nimagine destroying a soul? Ripping it to shreds so that\nnothing remains to go on its next great adventure? Can you imagine\nwhat a terrible thing that would be, the worst crime that had ever\nbeen committed in the history of the universe, which you would do\nanything to prevent from happening even once? Because\nthat's what Death really is - the annihilation of a\nsoul!\"",
      "The old wizard was staring at him, a sad look in his eyes. \"I\nsuppose I do understand now,\" he said quietly.",
      "\"Oh?\" said Harry. \"Understand what?\"",
      "\"Voldemort,\" said the old wizard. \"I understand him now at last.\nBecause to believe that the world is truly like that, you must\nbelieve there is no justice in it, that it is woven of darkness at\nits core. I asked you why he became a monster, and you could give\nno reason. And if I could ask him, I suppose, his answer\nwould be: Why not?\"",
      "They stood there gazing into each other's eyes, the old wizard\nin his robes, and the young boy with the lightning-bolt scar on his\nforehead.",
      "\"Tell me, Harry,\" said the old wizard, \"will you become\na monster?\"",
      "\"No,\" said the boy, an iron certainty in his voice.",
      "\"Why not?\" said the old wizard.",
      "The young boy stood very straight, his chin raised high and\nproud, and said: \"There is no justice in the laws of Nature,\nHeadmaster, no term for fairness in the equations of motion. The\nuniverse is neither evil, nor good, it simply does not care. The\nstars don't care, or the Sun, or the sky. But they don't have to!\nWe care! There is light in the world, and it is\nus!\u202f\"",
      "\"I wonder what will become of you, Harry,\" said the old wizard.\nHis voice was soft, with a strange wonder and regret in it. \"It is\nenough to make me wish to live just to see it.\"",
      "The boy bowed to him with heavy irony, and departed; and the\noaken door slammed shut behind him with a thud."

      "Harry, holding the tea cup in the exactly correct way that\nProfessor Quirrell had needed to demonstrate three times, took a\nsmall, careful sip. All the way across the long, wide table that\nwas the centerpiece of Mary's Room, Professor Quirrell took a sip\nfrom his own cup, making it look far more natural and elegant. The\ntea itself was something whose name Harry couldn't even pronounce,\nor at least, every time Harry had tried to repeat the Chinese\nwords, Professor Quirrell had corrected him, until finally Harry\nhad given up.",
      "Harry had maneuvered himself into getting a glimpse at the bill\nlast time, and Professor Quirrell had let him get away with it.",
      "He'd felt an impulse to drink a Comed-Tea first.",
      "Even taking that into account, Harry had still been\nshocked out of his skin.",
      "And it still tasted to him like, well, tea.",
      "There was a quiet, nagging suspicion in Harry's mind that\nProfessor Quirrell knew this, and was deliberately buying\nridiculously expensive tea that Harry couldn't appreciate just\nto mess with him. Professor Quirrell himself might\nnot like it all that much. Maybe nobody actually liked\nthis tea, and the only point of it was to be ridiculously expensive\nand make the victim feel unappreciative. In fact, maybe it was\nreally just ordinary tea, only you asked for it in a certain code,\nand they put a fake gigantic price on the bill...",
      "Professor Quirrell's expression was drawn and thoughtful. \"No,\"\nProfessor Quirrell said, \"you should not have told the\nHeadmaster about your conversation with Lord Malfoy. Please try to\nthink faster next time, Mr. Potter.\"",
      "\"I'm sorry, Professor Quirrell,\" Harry said meekly. \"I still\ndon't see it.\" There were times when Harry felt very much like an\nimpostor, pretending to be cunning in Professor Quirrell's\npresence.",
      "\"Lord Malfoy is Albus Dumbledore's opponent,\" said Professor\nQuirrell. \"At least for this present time. All Britain is their\nchessboard, all wizards their pieces. Consider: Lord Malfoy\nthreatened to throw away everything, abandon his game, to take\nvengeance on you if Mr. Malfoy was hurt. In which case, Mr.\nPotter...?\"",
      "It took more long seconds for Harry to get it, but it was clear\nthat Professor Quirrell wasn't going to give any more hints, not\nthat Harry wanted them.",
      "Then Harry's mind finally made the connection, and he frowned.\n\"Dumbledore kills Draco, makes it look like I did it, and\nLucius sacrifices his game against Dumbledore to get at me? That...\ndoesn't seem like the Headmaster's style, Professor\nQuirrell...\" Harry's mind flashed back to a similar warning from\nDraco, which had made Harry say the same thing.",
      "Professor Quirrell shrugged, and sipped his tea.",
      "Harry sipped his own tea, and sat in silence. The tablecloth\nspread over the table was in a very peaceful pattern, seeming at\nfirst like plain cloth, but if you stared at it long enough, or\nkept silent long enough, you started to see a faint tracery of\nflowers glimmering on it; the curtains of the room had changed\ntheir pattern to match, and seemed to shimmer as though in a silent\nbreeze. Professor Quirrell was in a contemplative mood that\nSaturday, and so was Harry, and Mary's Room, it seemed, had not\nneglected to notice this.",
      "\"Professor Quirrell,\" Harry said suddenly, \"is there an\nafterlife?\"",
      "Harry had chosen the question carefully. Not, do you believe\nin an afterlife? but simply Is there an afterlife?\nWhat people really believed didn't seem to them like\nbeliefs at all. People didn't say, 'I strongly believe in\nthe sky being blue!' They just said, 'the sky is blue'. Your true\ninner map of the world just felt to you like the way the world\nwas...",
      "The Defense Professor raised his cup to his lips again before\nanswering. His face was thoughtful. \"If there is, Mr. Potter,\" said\nProfessor Quirrell, \"then quite a few wizards have wasted a great\ndeal of effort in their searches for immortality.\"",
      "\"That's not actually an answer,\" Harry observed. He'd learned by\nnow to notice that sort of thing when talking to Professor\nQuirrell.",
      "Professor Quirrell set down his teacup with a small,\nhigh-pitched tacking sound on his saucer. \"Some of those wizards\nwere reasonably intelligent, Mr. Potter, so you may take it that\nthe existence of an afterlife is not obvious. I have looked into\nthe matter myself. There have been many claims of the sort which\nhope and fear would be expected to produce. Among those reports\nwhose veracity is not in doubt, there is nothing which could not be\nthe result of mere wizardry. There are certain devices said to\ncommunicate with the dead, but these, I suspect, only project an\nimage from the mind; the result seems indistinguishable from memory\nbecause it is memory. The alleged spirits tell no secrets\nthey knew in life, nor could have learned after death, which are\nnot known to the wielder -\"",
      "\"Which is why the Resurrection Stone is not the most valuable\nmagical artifact in the world,\" said Harry.",
      "\"Precisely,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"though I wouldn't say no\nto a chance to try it.\" There was a dry, thin smile on his lips;\nand something colder, more distant, in his eyes. \"You spoke to\nDumbledore of that as well, I take it.\"",
      "Harry nodded.",
      "The curtains were taking on a faintly blue pattern, and a dim\ntracery of elaborate snowflakes now seemed to be becoming visible\non the tablecloth. Professor Quirrell's voice sounded very calm.\n\"The Headmaster can be very persuasive, Mr. Potter. I hope he has\nnot persuaded you.\"",
      "\"Heck no,\" said Harry. \"Didn't fool me for a\nsecond.\"",
      "\"I should hope not,\" said Professor Quirrell, still in that very\ncalm tone. \"I would be extremely put out to discover that the\nHeadmaster had convinced you to throw away your life on some fool\nplot by telling you that death is the next great adventure.\"",
      "\"I don't think the Headmaster believed it himself, actually,\"\nHarry said. He sipped his own tea again. \"He asked me what I could\npossibly do with eternity, gave me the usual line about it being\nboring, and he didn't seem to see any conflict between that and his\nown claim to have an immortal soul. In fact, he gave me a whole\nlong lecture about how awful it was to want immortality before he\nclaimed to have an immortal soul. I can't quite visualize what must\nhave been going on inside his head, but I don't think he\nactually had a mental model of himself continuing forever\nin the afterlife...\"",
      "The temperature of the room seemed to be dropping.",
      "\"You perceive,\" said a voice like ice from the other end of the\ntable, \"that Dumbledore does not truly believe as he speaks. It is\nnot that he has compromised his principles. It is that he never had\nthem from the beginning. Are you becoming cynical yet, Mr.\nPotter?\"",
      "Harry had dropped his eyes to his teacup. \"A little,\" Harry said\nto his possibly-ultra-high-quality, perhaps-ridiculously-expensive\nChinese tea. \"I'm certainly becoming a bit frustrated\nwith... whatever's going wrong in people's heads.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" said that icy voice. \"I find it frustrating as well.\"",
      "\"Is there any way to get people not to do that?\" said\nHarry to his teacup.",
      "\"There is indeed a certain useful spell which solves the\nproblem.\"",
      "Harry looked up hopefully at that, and saw a cold, cold smile on\nthe Defense Professor's face.",
      "Then Harry got it. \"I mean, besides Avada Kedavra.\"",
      "The Defense Professor laughed. Harry didn't.",
      "\"Anyway,\" Harry said hastily, \"I did think fast enough\nnot to suggest the obvious idea about the Resurrection Stone in\nfront of Dumbledore. Have you ever seen a stone with a line, inside\na circle, inside a triangle?\"",
      "The deathly chill seemed to draw back, fold into itself, as the\nordinary Professor Quirrell returned. \"Not that I can recall,\"\nProfessor Quirrell said after a while, a thoughtful frown on his\nface. \"That is the Resurrection Stone?\"",
      "Harry set aside his teacup, then drew on his saucer the symbol\nhe had seen on the inside of his cloak. And before Harry could take\nout his own wand to cast the Hover Charm, the saucer went floating\nobligingly across the table toward Professor Quirrell. Harry really\nwanted to learn that wandless stuff, but that, apparently, was far\nabove his current curriculum.",
      "Professor Quirrell studied Harry's tea-saucer for a moment, then\nshook his head; and a moment later, the saucer went floating back\nto Harry.",
      "Harry put his teacup back on the saucer, noting absently as he\ndid so that the symbol he'd drawn had vanished. \"If you happen to\nsee a stone with that symbol,\" said Harry, \"and it does\ntalk to the afterlife, do let me know. I have a few questions for\nMerlin or anyone who was around in Atlantis.\"",
      "\"Quite,\" said Professor Quirrell. Then the Defense Professor\nlifted up his teacup again, and tipped it back as though to finish\nthe last of what was there. \"By the way, Mr. Potter, I fear we\nshall have to cut short today's visit to Diagon Alley. I was hoping\nit would - but never mind. Let it stand that there is something\nelse I must do this afternoon.\"",
      "Harry nodded, and finished his own tea, then rose from his seat\nat the same time as Professor Quirrell.",
      "\"One last question,\" Harry said, as Professor Quirrell's coat\nlifted itself off the coatrack and went floating toward the Defense\nProfessor. \"Magic is loose in the world, and I no longer trust my\nguesses so much as I once did. So in your own best guess and\nwithout any wishful thinking, do you believe there's an\nafterlife?\"",
      "\"If I did, Mr. Potter,\" said Professor Quirrell as he shrugged\non his coat, \"would I still be here?\u202f\""

The most recent snow had mostly blown\naway, but occasional patches of melted and refrozen ice still stuck\nto the stone face and blazed reflected sunlight. From a distance,\nit must have looked like Hogwarts was blinking hundreds of\neyes.",
      "A sudden gust made Draco flinch, and try, impossibly, to press\nhis body even closer to the stone, which felt like ice and smelled\nlike ice. Some utterly pointless instinct seemed convinced that he\nwas about to be blown off the outer wall of Hogwarts, and that the\nbest way to prevent this was to jerk around in helpless reflex and\npossibly throw up.",

      "\"You know, Mr. Malfoy,\" said the young girl beside him in a\nconversational voice, \"if a seer had told me that someday I'd be\nhanging onto the side of a castle by my fingertips, trying not to\nlook down or think about how loud Mum'd scream if she saw me, I\nwouldn't've had any idea of how it'd happen,\nexcept that it'd be Harry Potter's fault.\"",
      "Earlier:",
      "The two allied Generals stepped together over Longbottom's body,\ntheir boots hitting the floor in almost perfect synchrony.",
      "Only a single soldier now stood between them and Harry, a\nSlytherin boy named Samuel Clamons, whose hand was clenched white\naround his wand, held upward to sustain his Prismatic Wall. The\nboy's breathing was coming rapidly, but his face showed the same\ncold determination that lit the eyes of his general, Harry Potter,\nwho was standing behind the Prismatic Wall at the dead end of the\ncorridor next to an open window, with his hands held mysteriously\nbehind his back.",
      "The battle had been ridiculously difficult, for the enemy being\noutnumbered two-to-one. It should have been easy, Dragon Army and\nthe Sunshine Regiment had melded together easily in practice\nsessions, they'd fought each other long enough to know each other\nvery well indeed. Morale was high, both armies knowing that this\ntime they weren't just fighting to win for themselves, but fighting\nfor a world free of traitors. Despite the surprised protests of\nboth generals, the soldiers of the combined army had insisted on\ncalling themselves Dramione's Sungon Argiment, and produced patches\nfor their insignia of a smiling face wreathed in flames.",
      "But Harry's soldiers had all blackened their own insignia - it\ndidn't look like paint, more like they'd burned that part\nof their uniforms - and they'd fought all through the upper levels\nof Hogwarts with a desperate fury. The cold rage that Draco\nsometimes saw in Harry had seemed to trickle down into his\nsoldiers, and they'd fought like it hadn't been play. And Harry had\nemptied out his entire bag of tricks, there'd been tiny metal balls\n(Granger had identified them as \"ball bearings\") on floors and\nstaircases, rendering them impassable until cleared, only Harry's\narmy had already practiced coordinated Hover Charms and they could\nfly their own people right over the obstacles they'd\nmade...",
      "You couldn't bring devices into the game from outside, but you\ncould Transfigure anything you wanted during the game, so\nlong as it was safe.

      "And so it had come to this.",
      "The survivors of the allied forces had cornered the last\nremnants of Harry Potter's army in a dead-end corridor.",
      "Weasley and Vincent had rushed Longbottom at the same time,\nmoving together like they'd practiced for weeks instead of hours,\nand somehow Longbottom had managed to hex them both before\nfalling himself.",

      "And also inevitably, because it happened without the slightest\nthought, Draco spun and grabbed for Granger's right arm, and he\ncaught her, only she was already too far off balance, she\nwas falling and pulling Draco with her, it all happened so quickly\n-",
      "There was a hard, painful impact, not just Draco's weight\nhitting the rooftop but some of Granger's weight too, and if she'd\nhit just a little bit closer to the edge they could have made it,\nbut instead her body tipped again and her legs slipped off and her\nother hand grabbed frantically...",
      "And that was how Draco ended up holding onto Granger's arm in a\nwhite grip, while her other hand clenched frantically at the edge\nof the rooftop and the toes of Draco's shoes dug into the edge of a\nroof tile.",
      "\"Hermione!\u202f\" Harry's voice shrieked distantly.",
      "\"Draco,\" whispered Granger's voice, and Draco looked down.",
      "That might have been a mistake. There was a lot of air\nunderneath her, nothing but air, they were on the edge of a rooftop\nthat had jutted out from the main stone wall of Hogwarts.",
      "\"He's going to come help me,\" whispered the girl, \"but first\nhe's going to Luminos both of us, there's no way he\nwouldn't. You have to let me go.\"",
      "It should have been the easiest thing in the world.",
      "She was just a mudblood, just a mudblood, just a\nmudblood!",
      "She wouldn't even be hurt!",
      "...Draco's brain wasn't listening to anything Draco was telling\nit right now.",
      "\"Do it,\" Hermione Granger whispered, her eyes blazing without a\nsingle trace of fear, \"do it, Draco, do it, you can beat him\nyourself we have to win Draco!\u202f\"",
      "There was a sound of someone running and it was coming\ncloser.",
      "Oh, be rational...",
      "The voice in Draco's head sounded an awful lot like Harry Potter\nteaching lessons.",
      "...are you going to let your brain run your life?",
      "Aftermath, 1:",
      "It was taking a bit of an effort for Daphne Greengrass to keep\nherself quiet, as Millicent Bulstrode retold the story in the\nSlytherin girls' common room (a cozy cool place in the dungeons\nrunning beneath the Hogwarts Lake, with fish swimming past every\nwindow, and couches you could lie down in if you wanted). Mostly\nbecause, in Daphne's opinion, it was a perfectly good story already\nwithout all of Millicent's improvements.",
      "\"And then what?\" gasped Flora and Hestia Carrow.",
      "\"General Granger looked up at him,\" Millicent said dramatically,\n\"and she said, 'Draco! You've got to let go of me! Don't worry\nabout me, Draco, I promise I'll be all right! And what do you\nsuppose Malfoy did then?\"",
      "\"He said 'Never!',\" shouted Charlotte Wiland, \"and held on even\ntighter!\"",
      "All the listening girls except Pansy Parkinson nodded.",
      "\"Nope!\" said Millicent. \"He dropped her. And then he jumped up\nand shot General Potter. The end.\"",
      "There was a stunned pause.",
      "\"You can't do that!\" said Charlotte.",
      "\"She's a mudblood,\" said Pansy, sounding confused. \"Of\ncourse he let go!\"",
      "\"Well, Malfoy shouldn't have grabbed her in the first place,\nthen!\" said Charlotte. \"But once he grabbed her, he had to\nhang on! Especially in the face of approaching certain\ndoom!\" Tracey Davis, sitting next to Daphne, was nodding along in\nfirm agreement.",
      "\"I don't see why,\" said Pansy.",
      "\"That's because you don't have the tiniest smidgin of romance in\nyou,\" said Tracey. \"Besides, you can't just go dropping girls. A\nboy who'd drop a girl like that... he'd drop anyone. He'd\ndrop you, Pansy.\"",
      "\"What d'you mean, drop me?\u202f\" Pansy said.",
      "Daphne couldn't resist any more. \"You know,\" Daphne said darkly,\n\"you're eating breakfast one day at our table, and the next thing\nyou know, Malfoy lets go of you, and you're falling off\nthe top of Hogwarts! That's what!\"",
      "\"Yeah!\" said Charlotte. \"He's a witch dropper!\"",
      "\"You know why Atlantis fell?\" said Tracey. \"'Cause someone like\nMalfoy dropped it, that's why!\"",
      "Daphne lowered her voice. \"In fact... what if Malfoy's the one\nwho made Hermione, I mean General Granger, slip in the first place?\nWhat if he's out to make all the Muggleborns trip and\nfall?\"",
      "\"You mean - ?\" gasped Tracey.",
      "\"That's right!\" Daphne said dramatically. \"What if Malfoy is -\nthe heir of Slipperin?\u202f\"",
      "\"The next Drop Lord!\" said Tracey.",
      "Which was far too good a line for anyone to keep to themselves,\nso by nightfall it was all over Hogwarts, and the next morning it\nwas the Quibbler's headline.",
      "Aftermath, 2:",
      "Hermione made sure she got to their usual classroom nice and\nearly that evening, just so that she would be by herself, in a\nchair, peacefully reading a book, when Harry got there.",
      "If there was any way for a door to creak open apologetically,\nthat was how the door was creaking open.",
      "\"Um,\" said Harry Potter's voice.",
      "Hermione kept reading.",
      "\"I'm, um, kinda sorry, I didn't mean for you to\nactually fall off the roof or anything...\"",
      "It had been quite an entertaining experience, in fact.",
      "\"I, ah... I don't have much experience apologizing, I'll fall to\nmy knees if you want, or buy you something expensive, Hermione\nI don't know how to apologize to you for this what can I do just\ntell me?\u202f\"",
      "She kept reading the book in silence.",
      "It wasn't as if she had any idea how Harry could\napologize, either.",
      "Right now she was just feeling a sort of odd curiosity as to\nwhat would happen if she kept reading her book for a while."

      "\"Romantic?\u202f\" Hermione said. \"They're both\nboys!\u202f\"",
      "\"Wow,\" Daphne said, sounding a little shocked. \"You mean Muggles\nreally do hate that? I thought that was just something the\nDeath Eaters made up.\"",
      "\"No,\" said an older Slytherin girl Hermione didn't recognize,\n\"it's true, they have to get married in secret, and if they're ever\ndiscovered, they get burned at the stake together. And if you're a\ngirl who thinks it's romantic, they burn you too.\"",
      "\"That can't be right!\" objected a Gryffindor girl, while\nHermione was still trying to sort out what to say to that. \"There\nwouldn't be any Muggle girls left!\u202f\"",
      "She'd kept on reading quietly, and Harry Potter had kept on\ntrying to apologize, and it had soon dawned on Hermione that Harry\nhad realized, possibly for the first time in his life, that he'd\ndone something annoying; and that Harry, definitely for the first\ntime in his life, was terrified that he'd lost her as a\nfriend; and she'd started to feel (a) guilty and (b) worried about\nthe direction Harry's increasingly desperate offers were going. But\nshe still had no idea what sort of apology was appropriate, so\nshe'd said that the Ravenclaw girls should vote on it - and this\ntime she wouldn't fix the outcome, though she hadn't mentioned that\npart - to which Harry had instantly agreed.",
      "The next day, practically every Ravenclaw girl over the age of\nthirteen had voted to have Draco drop Harry.",
      "Hermione had felt mildly disappointed it was that simple, though\nit was obviously fair.",
      "Right now, however, standing just outside the great doors of the\ncastle amid half the female population of Hogwarts, Hermione was\nbeginning to suspect that there were things going on here\nthat she did not understand and that she desperately hoped neither\nof her fellow generals ever heard about.",
      "You couldn't really see the details from up there, just the\ngeneral fact of a sea of expectant female faces.",
      "\"You've got no idea what this is about, do you?\" said Draco,\nsounding amused.",
      "Harry had read a fair number of books he wasn't supposed to\nread, not to mention a few Quibbler headlines.",
      "\"Boy-Who-Lived gets Draco Malfoy pregnant?\" said Harry.",
      "\"Okay, you do know what this is about,\" said Draco. \"I\nthought Muggles hated that?\"",
      "\"Only the dumb ones,\" said Harry. \"But, um, aren't we, uh, a\nlittle young?\u202f\"",
      "\"Not too young for them,\" said Draco. He snorted.\n\"Girls!\u202f\"",
      "They silently walked toward the edge of the roof.",
      "\"So I'm doing this for revenge on you,\" said Draco,\n\"but why are you doing this?\"",
      "Harry's mind made a lightning calculation, weighing the factors,\nwhether it was too soon...",
      "\"Honestly?\" said Harry. \"Because I meant to have her climb up\nthe icy walls, but I didn't mean to have her fall off the\nroof. And, um, I kinda did feel really awful about that. I\nmean, I guess I actually did start seeing her as my friendly rival\nafter a while. So this is a real apology to her, not a plot or\nanything.\"",
      "There was a pause.",
      "Then -",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Draco. \"I understand.\"",
      "Harry didn't smile. It might have been the most difficult\nnonsmile of his life.",
      "Draco looked at the edge of the roof, and made a face. \"This is\ngoing to be a lot harder to do on purpose than by accident, isn't\nit.\"",
      "Harry's other hand held the roof in a reflexively terrified\ngrip, his fingers white on the cold, cold stone.",
      "You could know with your conscious mind that you'd drunk the\nFeather-Falling Potion. Knowing it with your unconscious mind was\nanother matter entirely.",
      "It was every bit as scary as Harry had thought it might have\nbeen for Hermione, which was justice.",
      "\"Draco,\" said Harry, controlling his voice wasn't easy, but the\nRavenclaw girls had given them a script, \"You've got to let me\ngo!\"",
      "\"Okay!\" said Draco, and let go of Harry's arm.",
      "Harry's other hand scrabbled at the edge, and then, without any\ndecision being made, his fingers failed, and Harry fell.",
      "There was a brief moment when Harry's stomach tried to leap up\ninto his throat, and his body tried desperately to orient itself in\nthe absence of any possible way to do so.",
      "There was a brief moment when Harry could feel the\nFeather-Falling Potion kicking in, starting to slow him, a sort of\nlurching, cushioning feeling.",
      "And then something pulled on Harry and he accelerated\ndownward again faster than gravity -",
      "Harry's mouth had already opened and begun screaming while part\nof his brain tried to think of something creative he could do, part\nof his brain tried to calculate how much time he had left to be\ncreative, and a tiny rump part of his brain noticed that he wasn't\neven going to finish the remaining-time calculation before he hit\nthe ground -",
      "Harry was desperately trying to control his hyperventilating,\nand it wasn't helping him to hear the shrieking of all the girls,\nnow lying in heaps on the ground and each other.",
      "\"Good heavens,\" said the unfamiliar man, he of the old-looking\nclothes and faintly scarred face, who was holding Harry in his\narms. \"Of all the ways I imagined we might meet again someday, I\ndidn't expect it to be you falling out of the sky.\"",
      "Harry remembered the last thing he'd seen, the falling body, and\nmanaged to gasp, \"Professor... Quirrell...\"",
      "\"He'll be all right after a few hours,\" said the unfamiliar man\nholding Harry. \"He's just exhausted. I wouldn't have thought it\npossible... he must have knocked down two hundred students\njust to make sure he got whoever was jinxing you...\"",
      "Gently, the man set Harry upright on the ground, supporting him\nthe while.",
      "Harry carefully balanced himself, and nodded to the man.",
      "He let go, and Harry promptly fell over.",
      "The man helped him rise again. Making sure, at all times, to\nstand between Harry and the girls now picking themselves up from\nthe ground, his head constantly glancing in that direction.",
      "\"Harry,\" the man said quietly, and very seriously, \"do you have\nany idea which of these girls might have wanted to kill you?\"",
      "\"Not murder,\" said a strained voice. \"Just stupidity.\"",
      "This time it was the unfamiliar man who seemed to almost fall\nover, utter shock on his face.",
      "Professor Quirrell was already sitting up from where he'd fallen\non the grass.",
      "\"Good heavens!\" gasped the man. \"You shouldn't be -\"",
      "\"Mr. Lupin, your concerns are misplaced. No wizard, no matter\nhow powerful, casts such a Charm by strength alone. You must do it\nby being efficient.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell didn't stand up, though.",
      "\"Thank you,\" Harry whispered. And then, \"Thank you,\" to the man\nstanding beside him as well.",
      "\"What happened?\" said the man.",
      "\"I should have foreseen it myself,\" Professor Quirrell said, his\nvoice crisp with disapproval. \"Some number of girls tried to summon\nMr. Potter to their own, particular arms. Individually, I suppose,\nthey all thought they were being gentle.\"",
      "Oh.",
      "\"Consider it a lesson in preparedness, Mr. Potter,\" said\nProfessor Quirrell. \"Had I not insisted that there be more\nthan one adult witness to this little event, and that both\nof us have our wands out, Mr. Lupin would not have been available\nto slow your fall afterward, and you would have been gravely\ninjured.\"",
      "\"Sir!\u202f\" said the man - Mr. Lupin, apparently. \"You\nshould not say such things to the boy!\"",
      "\"Who is -\" Harry started to say.",
      "\"The only other person who was available to watch, besides\nmyself,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"I introduce you to Remus Lupin,\nwho is here temporarily to instruct students in the Patronus Charm.\nThough I am told that the two of you have already met.\"",
      "Harry studied the man, puzzled. He should have remembered that\nfaintly scarred face, that strange, gentle smile.",
      "\"Where did we meet?\" said Harry.",
      "\"In Godric's Hollow,\" said the man. \"I changed a number of your\nnappies.\"",
      "Mr. Lupin's temporary office was a small stone room with a small\nwooden desk, and Harry couldn't see anything of what Mr. Lupin was\nsitting on, suggesting that it was a small stool just like the one\nin front of his desk. Harry guessed that Mr. Lupin wouldn't be at\nHogwarts for long, or use this office much, and so he'd told the\nhouse elves not to waste the effort. It said something about a\nperson that he tried not to bother house elves. Specifically, it\nsaid that he'd been Sorted into Hufflepuff, since, to the best of\nHarry's knowledge, Hermione was the only non-Hufflepuff who worried\nabout bothering house elves. (Harry himself thought her qualms\nrather silly. Whoever had created house elves in the first place\nhad been unspeakably evil, obviously; but that didn't mean Hermione\nwas doing the right thing now by denying sentient beings\nthe drudgery they had been shaped to enjoy.)",
      "\"Please sit down, Harry,\" the man said quietly. His formal robes\nwere of low quality, not quite tattered, but visibly worn by the\npassage of time in a way that simple Repair Charms couldn't fix;\nshabby was the word that came to mind. And despite that,\nsomehow, there was a dignity about him that couldn't have been\nobtained by fine and expensive robes, that wouldn't have\nfit with fine robes, that was the exclusive property of\nthe shabby. Harry had heard of humility, but he'd never\nseen the real thing before - only the satisfied modesty of people\nwho thought it was part of their style and wanted you to\nnotice.",
      "Harry took a seat on the small wooden stool in front of Mr.\nLupin's short desk.",
      "\"Thank you for coming,\" the man said.",
      "\"No, thank you for saving me,\" said Harry. \"Let me know\nif you ever need something impossible done.\"",
      "The man seemed to hesitate. \"Harry, may I... ask a personal\nquestion?\"",
      "\"You can ask, certainly,\" Harry said. \"I have a lot of questions\nfor you, too.\"",
      "Mr. Lupin nodded. \"Harry, are your stepparents treating you\nwell?\"",
      "\"My parents,\" Harry said. \"I have four. Michael, James,\nPetunia, and Lily.\"",
      "\"Ah,\" said Mr. Lupin. And then, \"Ah\" again. He seemed to be\nblinking rather hard. \"I... that is good to hear, Harry, Dumbledore\nwould tell none of us where you were... I was afraid he might think\nyou ought to have wicked stepparents, or some such... \"",
      "Harry wasn't sure Mr. Lupin's concern had been misplaced,\nconsidering his own first encounter with Dumbledore; but it had all\nturned out well enough, so he said nothing. \"What about my...\"\nHarry searched for a word that didn't raise them higher or put them\nlower... \"other parents? I want to know, well,\neverything.\"",
      "\"A tall order,\" Mr. Lupin said. He wiped a hand across his\nforehead. \"Well, let us begin at the beginning. When you were born,\nJames was so happy that he couldn't touch his wand without it\nglowing gold, for a whole week. And even after that, whenever he\nheld you, or saw Lily holding you, or just thought of you, it would\nhappen again -\"",
      "Every now and then Harry would look at his watch, and find that\nanother thirty minutes had passed. He felt slightly bad about\nmaking Remus miss dinner, especially since Harry himself would just\ndrop back to 7pm later, but that wasn't enough to stop either of\nthem.",
      "Finally Harry screwed up enough courage to ask the critical\nquestion, while Remus was in the middle of an extended discourse on\nthe wonders of James's Quidditch that Harry couldn't find the heart\nto squash more directly.",
      "\"And that was when,\" Remus said, his eyes shining brightly,\n\"James pulled off a triple reverse Mulhanney Dive with\nextra backspin! The whole crowd went wild, even some of\nthe Hufflepuffs were cheering -\"",
      "I guess you had to be there, Harry thought - not that\nbeing there would have helped in any way - and said, \"Mr.\nLupin?\"",
      "Something about Harry's voice must have reached the man, because\nhe stopped in mid-sentence.",
      "\"Was my father a bully?\" said Harry.",
      "Remus looked at Harry for a long moment. \"For a little while,\"\nRemus said. \"He grew out of it soon enough. Where did you hear\nthat?\"",
      "Harry didn't answer, he was trying to think of something true to\nsay that would deflect suspicion, but he didn't think fast\nenough.",
      "\"Never mind,\" said Remus, and sighed. \"I can guess who.\" The\nfaintly scarred face was pinched in disapproval. \"What a thing to\ntell -\"",
      "\"Did my father have any extenuating circumstances?\" Harry said.\n\"Poor home life, or something like that? Or was he just... being\nnaturally nasty?\" Cold?",
      "Remus's hand swept his hair back, the first nervous gesture\nHarry had seen from him. \"Harry,\" Remus said, \"you can't judge your\nfather by what he did as a young boy!\"",
      "\"I'm a young boy,\" Harry said, \"and I judge\nmyself.\"",
      "Remus blinked twice at that.",
      "\"I want to know why,\" Harry said. \"I want to\nunderstand, because to me, it seems like there isn't any\npossible excuse for that!\" Voice shaking a bit. \"Please tell me\nanything you know about why he did it, even if it doesn't sound\nnice.\" So I don't fall into the same trap myself, whatever it\nis.",
      "\"It was the thing to do if you were in Gryffindor,\" Remus said,\nslowly, reluctantly. \"And... I didn't think so back then, I thought\nit was the other way around, but... it might have been\nBlack who got James into it, really... Black\nwanted so much to show everyone that he was against Slytherin, you\nsee, we all wanted to believe that blood wasn't destiny -\"",
      "\"No, Harry,\" said Remus. \"I don't know why Black went after\nPeter instead of running. It was as though Black was making tragedy\nfor the sake of tragedy that day.\" The man's voice was unsteady.\n\"There was no hint, no warning, we all thought - to think that he\nwas to be -\" Remus's voice cut off.",
      "Harry was crying, he couldn't help it, it hurt worse to hear it\nfrom Remus than anything he'd ever felt himself. Harry had lost two\nparents he didn't remember, knew only from stories. Remus Lupin had\nlost all four of his best friends in less than twenty-four hours;\nand for the loss of his last remaining one, Peter Pettigrew,\nthere'd just been no reason at all.",
      "\"Sometimes it still hurts to think of him in Azkaban,\" Remus\nfinished, his voice almost a whisper. \"I am glad, Harry, that Death\nEaters are not allowed visitors. It means I do not have to feel\nashamed of not going.\"",
      "Harry had to swallow hard several times before he could speak.\n\"Can you tell me about Peter Pettigrew? He was my father's friend,\nand it seems - that I should know, that I should remember -\"",
      "Remus nodded, water glittering in his own eyes now. \"I think,\nHarry, that if Peter had known it would end that way -\" the man's\nvoice choked up. \"Peter was more afraid of the Dark Lord than any\nof us, and if he'd known it would end that way, I don't think he\nwould have done it. But Peter knew the risk, Harry, he\nknew the risk was real, that it could happen, and yet he\nstayed by James and Lily's side. All through Hogwarts I used to\nwonder why Peter hadn't been sorted into Slytherin, or maybe\nRavenclaw, because Peter so adored secrets, he couldn't resist\nthem, he would find out things about people, things they wanted\nkept hidden -\" A brief wry look crossed Remus's face. \"But he\ndidn't use those secrets, Harry. He just wanted to know.\nAnd then the Dark Lord's shadow fell over everything, and Peter\nstood by James and Lily and put his talents to good use, and I\nunderstood why the Hat had sent him to Gryffindor.\" Remus's voice\nwas fierce now, and proud. \"It's easy to stand by your\nfriends if you're a hero like Godric, bold and strong like people\nthink Gryffindors should be. But if Peter was more afraid than any\nof us, doesn't that also make him the most brave?\"",
      "\"It does,\" Harry said. His own voice was choked to where he\nalmost couldn't talk. \"If you could, Mr. Lupin, if you have time,\nthere's someone else who I think should hear Peter Pettigrew's\nstory, a student in first-year Hufflepuff, named Neville\nLongbottom.\"",
      "\"Alice and Frank's boy,\" said Remus, his voice turning sad. \"I\nsee. It is not a happy story, Harry, but I can tell it again, if\nyou think it will help him.\"",
      "Harry nodded.",
      "A brief silence fell.",
      "\"Did Black have any unfinished business with Peter\nPettigrew?\" Harry said. \"Anything that would make him seek\nout Mr. Pettigrew, even if it wasn't a killing matter? Like a\nsecret Mr. Pettigrew knew, that Black wanted to know himself, or\nwanted to kill him to hide?\"",
      "Something flickered in Remus's eyes, but the older man shook his\nhead, and said, \"Not really.\"",
      "\"That means there is something,\" said Harry.",
      "That wry smile appeared again beneath the salt-and-pepper\nmustache. \"You have a bit of Peter in you yourself, I see. But it's\nnot important, Harry.\"",
      "\"I'm a Ravenclaw, I'm not supposed to resist the\ntemptation of secrets. And,\" Harry said more seriously, \"if it was\nworth Black getting caught, I can't help but think it might\nmatter.\"",
      "Remus looked quite uncomfortable. \"I suppose I could tell you\nwhen you're older, but really, Harry, it's not important!\nJust something from our school days.\"",
      "Harry couldn't have put his finger on exactly what tipped him\noff; it might have been something about the exact tone of\nnervousness in Remus's voice, or the way the man had said when\nyou're older, that sparked the sudden leap of Harry's\nintuition...",
      "\"Actually,\" said Harry, \"I think I've sort of guessed it\nalready, sorry.\"",
      "Remus raised his eyebrows. \"Have you?\" He sounded a bit\nskeptical.",
      "\"They were lovers, weren't they?\"",
      "There was an awkward pause.",
      "Remus gave a slow, grave nod.",
      "\"Once,\" Remus said. \"A long time ago. A sad affair, ending in\nvast tragedy, or so it seemed to us all when we were young.\" The\nunhappy puzzlement was plain on his face. \"But I had thought that\nlong since over and done and buried beneath adult friendship, until\nthe day that Black killed Peter.\""

      "The gentle sun of January shone on the cold fields outside\nHogwarts.",
      "For some of the students it was a study hour, and others had\nbeen let out of class. The first-years who'd signed up for it were\npracticing a certain spell, a spell that was most advantageously\nlearned outdoors, beneath the bright sun and a clear blue sky,\nrather than within the confines of any classroom. Cookies and\nlemonade were also considered helpful.",
      "The early gestures of the spell were complex and precise; you\ntwitched your wand once, twice, thrice, and four times with small\ntilts at exactly the right relative angles, you shifted your\nforefinger and thumb exactly the right distances...",
      "The Ministry thought this meant it was futile to try and teach\nanyone the spell before their fifth year. There had been a few\nknown cases of younger children learning it, and this had been\ndismissed as \"genius\".",
      "It might not have been a very polite way of putting it, but\nHarry was beginning to see why Professor Quirrell had claimed that\nthe Ministry Committee of Curriculum would have been of greater\nbenefit to wizardkind if they had been used as landfill.",
      "So the gestures were complicated and delicate. That didn't stop\nyou from learning it when you were eleven. It meant you had to be\nextra careful and practice each part for a lot longer than usual,\nthat was all.",
      "Most Charms that could only be learned by older students were\nlike that because they required more strength of magic than any\nyoung student could muster. But the Patronus Charm wasn't\nlike that, it wasn't difficult because it needed too much magic, it\nwas difficult because it took more than mere magic.",
      "It took the warm, happy feelings that you kept close in your\nheart, the loving memories, a different kind of strength that you\ndidn't need for ordinary spells.",
      "Harry twitched his wand once, twice, thrice and four times,\nshifted his fingers exactly the right distances...",
      "\"Good luck at school, Harry. Do you think I bought you\nenough books?\"",
      "\"You can never have enough books... but you certainly tried,\nit was a really, really, really good try...\"",
      "It had brought tears to his eyes, the first time Harry had\nremembered and tried to put it into the spell.",
      "Harry brought the wand up and around and brandished it, a\ngesture that didn't have to be precise, only bold and defiant.",
      "\"Expecto Patronum!\u202f\" cried Harry.",
      "Nothing happened.",
      "Not a single flicker of light.",
      "When Harry looked up, Remus Lupin was still studying the wand, a\nrather troubled look on his faintly scarred face.",
      "Finally Remus shook his head. \"I'm sorry, Harry,\" the man said\nquietly. \"Your wandwork was exactly right.\"",
      "And there wasn't a flicker of light anywhere else, either,\nbecause all the other first-years who were supposed to be\npracticing their Patronus Charms had been glancing out of the\ncorners of their eyes at Harry instead.",
      "The tears were threatening to come back into Harry's eyes, and\nthey weren't happy tears. Of all the things, of all the things,\nHarry had never expected this.",
      "There was something horribly humiliating about being informed\nthat you weren't happy enough.",
      "What did Anthony Goldstein have inside him that Harry didn't,\nthat made Anthony's wand shine with that bright light?",
      "Did Anthony love his own father more?",
      "\"What thought were you using to cast it?\" said Remus.",
      "\"My father,\" Harry said, his voice trembling. \"I asked him to\nbuy me some books before I came to Hogwarts, and he did, and they\nwere expensive, and then he asked me if they were enough -\"",
      "Harry didn't try to explain about the Verres family motto.",
      "\"Take a rest before you try a different thought, Harry,\" said\nRemus. He gestured toward where some other students were sitting on\nthe ground, looking disappointed or embarrassed or regretful. \"You\nwon't be able to cast a Patronus Charm while you're feeling ashamed\nof not being grateful enough.\" There was a gentle compassion in Mr.\nLupin's voice, and for a moment, Harry felt like hitting\nsomething.",
      "Instead Harry turned around, and stalked to where the other\nfailures were sitting. The other students whose wandwork had also\nbeen proclaimed perfect, and who were now supposed to be searching\nfor happier thoughts; by the looks of them they weren't making much\nprogress. There were many robes there trimmed in dark blue, and a\nhandful of red, and one lone Hufflepuff girl who was still crying.\nThe Slytherins hadn't even bothered showing up, except for Daphne\nGreengrass and Tracey Davis, who were still trying to get the\ngestures.",
      "Harry plopped down on the cold dead grass of winter, next to the\nstudent whose failure had surprised him the most.",
      "\"So you couldn't do it either,\" Hermione said. She'd fled the\nfield at first, but she'd come back after that, and you had to look\nclosely at her reddened eyes to see that she'd been crying.",
      "\"I,\" Harry said, \"I, I'd probably feel a lot worse about that if\nyou hadn't failed, you're the nicest, person I know, that I've ever\nmet, Hermione, and if you also can't do it, it means I\nmight still be, be good...\"",
      "\"I should have gone to Gryffindor,\" Hermione whispered. She\nblinked hard a few times, but she didn't wipe her eyes.",
      "The boy and the girl walked forward together, definitely not\nholding hands, but each drawing a kind of strength from the other's\npresence, something that let them ignore the whispers of their\nyear-mates, as they walked through the hallway approaching the\ngreat doors of Hogwarts.",
      "Harry hadn't been able to cast the Patronus Charm no matter what\nhappy thought he tried. People hadn't seemed surprised by that,\nwhich made it even worse. Hermione hadn't been able to do it\neither. People had been very surprised by that, and Harry\nhad seen her starting to get the same sidelong looks as him. The\nother Ravenclaws who'd failed weren't getting those looks. But\nHermione was the Sunshine General, and her fans were treating it\nlike she'd failed them, somehow, like she'd betrayed a promise\nshe'd never made.",
      "The two of them had gone to the library to research the Patronus\nCharm, which was Hermione's way of dealing with distress, as it was\nsometimes also Harry's. Study, learn, try to understand\nwhy...",
      "The books had confirmed what the Headmaster had told Harry;\noften, wizards who couldn't cast the Patronus Charm in practice\nwould be able to do so in the presence of a real Dementor, going\nfrom flat failure all the way to a full corporeal Patronus. It\ndefied all logic, the Dementor's aura of fear ought to make it\nharder to wield a happy thought; but that was the way it\nwas.",
      "So the two of them were both going to give it one last try,\nthere was no way either of them wouldn't give it one last try.",
      "It was the day the Dementor came to Hogwarts.",
      "Earlier, Harry had unTransfigured his father's rock from where\nit usually rested on his pinky ring in the form of a tiny diamond,\nand placed the huge gray stone back into his pouch. Just in case\nHarry's magic failed entirely, when he confronted the darkest of\nall creatures.",
      "Harry had already started to feel pessimistic, and he wasn't\neven in front of a Dementor yet.",
      "\"I bet you can do it and I can't,\" Harry said in a whisper. \"I\nbet that's what happens.\"",
      "\"It felt wrong to me,\" Hermione said, her voice even quieter\nthan his. \"I tried it this morning and I realized. When I was doing\nthe brandish at the end, even before I said the words, it felt\nwrong.\"",
      "Harry didn't say anything. He'd felt the same thing, right from\nthe start, though it had taken another five attempts using five\nother happy thoughts before he'd been able to acknowledge it to\nhimself. Every time he tried to brandish his wand, it had felt\nhollow; the spell he was trying to learn didn't fit him.",
      "\"It doesn't mean we're going to be Dark Wizards,\" said Harry.\n\"Lots of people who can't cast the Patronus Charm aren't Dark\nWizards. Godric Gryffindor wasn't a Dark Wizard...\"",
      "Godric had defeated Dark Lords, fought to protect commoners from\nNoble Houses and Muggles from wizards. He'd had many fine friends\nand true, and lost no more than half of them in one good cause or\nanother. He'd listened to the screams of the wounded, in the armies\nhe'd raised to defend the innocent; young wizards of courage had\nrallied to his calls, and he'd buried them afterward. Until\nfinally, when his wizardry had only just begun to fail him in his\nold age, he'd brought together the three other most powerful\nwizards of his era to raise Hogwarts from the bare ground; the one\ngreat accomplishment to Godric's name that wasn't about war, any\nkind of war, no matter how just. It was Salazar, and not Godric,\nwho'd taught the first Hogwarts class in Battle Magic. Godric had\ntaught the first Hogwarts class in Herbology, the magics of green\ngrowing life.",
      "To his last day he'd never been able to cast the Patronus\nCharm.",
      "Godric Gryffindor had been a good man, not a happy one.",
      "Harry didn't believe in angst, he couldn't stand reading about\nwhiny heroes, he knew a billion other people in the world would\nhave given anything to trade places with him, and...",
      "And on his deathbed, Godric had told Helga (for Salazar had\nabandoned him, and Rowena passed before) that he didn't regret any\nof it, and he was not warning his students not to follow\nin his footsteps, no one was ever to say he'd told anyone\nnot to follow in his footsteps. If it had been the right thing for\nhim to do, then he wouldn't tell anyone else to choose\nwrongly, not even the youngest student in Hogwarts. And yet for\nthose who did follow in his footsteps, he hoped they would\nremember that Gryffindor had told his House that it was all right\nfor them to be happier than him. That red and gold would be bright\nwarm colors, from now on.",
      "And Helga had promised him, weeping, that when she was\nHeadmistress she would make sure of it.",
      "Whereupon Godric had died, and left no ghost behind him; and\nHarry had shoved the book back to Hermione and walked away a\nlittle, so she wouldn't see him crying.",
      "You wouldn't think that a book with an innocent title like \"The\nPatronus Charm: Wizards Who Could and Couldn't\" would be the\nsaddest book Harry had ever read.",
      "Harry...",
      "Harry didn't want that.",
      "To be in that book.",
      "Harry didn't want that.",
      "The rest of the school just seemed to think that No\nPatronus meant Bad Person, plain and simple. Somehow\nthe fact that Godric Gryffindor also hadn't been able to cast the\nPatronus Charm seemed not to get repeated. Maybe people didn't talk\nabout it to respect his last wish, Fred and George probably didn't\nknow and Harry certainly wasn't about to tell them. Or maybe the\nother failures didn't mention it because it was less shameful, the\nsmaller loss of pride and status, to be thought Dark rather than\nunhappy.",
      "Harry saw that Hermione, beside him, was blinking hard; and he\nwondered if she was thinking of Rowena Ravenclaw, who'd also loved\nbooks.",
      "\"Okay,\" Harry whispered. \"Happier thoughts. If you do go to a\nfull corporeal Patronus, what do you think your animal will\nbe?\"",
      "\"An otter,\" Hermione said at once.",
      "\"An otter?\u202f\" Harry whispered incredulously.",
      "\"Yes, an otter,\" said Hermione. \"What about yours?\"",
      "\"Peregrine falcon,\" Harry said without hesitation. \"It can dive\nfaster than three hundred kilometers per hour, it's the fastest\nliving creature there is.\" The peregrine falcon had been Harry's\nfavorite animal since forever. Harry was determined to become an\nAnimagus someday, just to get that as his form, and fly by the\nstrength of his own wings, and see the land below with sharper\neyes... \"But why an otter?\u202f\"",
      "Hermione smiled, but didn't say anything.",
      "And the vast doors of Hogwarts swung open.",
      "They walked for a time, the children, over a pathway that led\ntoward the unforbidden forest, and continued through the forest\nitself. The Sun was lowering to near the horizon, the shadows long,\nthe sunlight filtered through the bare branches of the winter\ntrees; for it was January, and the first-years the last to learn,\nthat day.",
      "Then the path swerved and took a new direction, and they all saw\nit in the distance, the clearing in the forest, and the sere winter\ngrounds, yellowing dried grass whitened by a few small remnants of\nsnow.",
      "The human figures still small at that range. The two spots of\ndim white light from the Aurors' Patronuses, and the brighter spot\nof silver light from the Headmaster's, next to something...",
      "Harry squinted.",
      "Something...",
      "It must have been purely Harry's imagination, because there\nshouldn't have been any way for a Dementor to reach past three\ncorporeal Patronuses, but he thought he could feel a touch of\nemptiness brushing at his mind, brushing straight at the soft inner\ncenter of himself without any respect for Occlumency barriers.",
      "Seamus Finnigan was ashen and trembling as he rejoined the\nstudents milling about on the withered and snow-spotted grass.\nSeamus's Patronus Charm had been successful, but there was still\nthat interval between when the Headmaster dispelled his own\nPatronus and when you were supposed to cast your own, when you\nfaced the Dementor's fear unshielded.",
      "Up to twenty seconds of exposure at five paces was certainly\nsafe, even for an eleven-year-old wizard with weak resistance and a\nstill-maturing brain. There was a lot of variance in how hard the\nDementor's power hit people, which was another thing not quite\nunderstood; but twenty seconds was definitely safe.",
      "Forty seconds of Dementor exposure at five paces might\npossibly have been enough to cause permanent damage,\nthough only to the most sensitive subjects.",
      "It was harsh training even by the standards of Hogwarts, where\nthe way you learned to fly on a hippogriff was by being tossed on\none and told to get going. Harry was no fan of overprotectiveness,\nand if you looked at the difference in maturity between a\nfourth-year in Hogwarts and a fourteen-year-old Muggle, it was\nclear that Muggles were smothering their children... but even Harry\nhad started to wonder if this was pushing it. Not every hurt could\nbe healed afterward.",
      "But if you couldn't cast the spell under those conditions, it\nmeant you couldn't rely on using the Patronus Charm to defend\nyourself; overconfidence was even more dangerous to wizards than to\nMuggles. Dementors could drain your magic and your physical\nvitality, not just your happy thoughts, which meant you might\nnot be able to Apparate away if you waited too long, or if\nyou didn't recognize the approaching fear until the Dementor was\nwithin range for its attack. (During his reading, Harry had\ndiscovered with considerable horror that some books claimed the\nDementor's Kiss would eat your soul and that this was the\nreason for the permanent mindless coma into which it put the\nvictims. And that wizards who believed this had\ndeliberately used the Dementor's Kiss to execute\ncriminals. It was a certainty that some called criminals were\ninnocent, and even if they weren't, destroying their\nsouls? If Harry had believed in souls, he would have... drawn\na blank, he just couldn't think of an appropriate response to\nthat.)",
      "The Headmaster was taking security seriously, and so were the\nthree Aurors standing guard. Their leader was an Asianish-looking\nman, solemn without being grim, Auror Komodo, whose wand never left\nhis hand. His Patronus, an orangutan of solid moonlight, paced back\nand forth between the Dementor and the first-years awaiting their\nturn; beside the orangutan moved the bright white panther of Auror\nButnaru, a man with a piercing gaze, long black hair in a ponytail,\nand a long braided goatee. Those two Aurors, and their two\nPatronuses, were all watching the Dementor. On the opposite side of\nthe students was the resting Auror Goryanof, tall and thin and pale\nand unshaven, sitting back on a chair he'd conjured without word or\nwand, and maintaining an absentminded pokerface as he scanned the\nentire scene. Professor Quirrell had shown up not long after the\nfirst-years began their attempts, and his eyes never strayed far\nfrom Harry. The tiny Professor Flitwick, who had been a champion\nduellist, was fiddling absently with his wand; and his\neyes, peering out from within the huge puffy beard that served as\nhis face, stayed focused on Professor Quirrell.",
      "And it must have been Harry's imagination, but Professor\nQuirrell seemed to wince slightly each time the Headmaster's\nPatronus winked out to test the next student. Maybe Professor\nQuirrell was imagining the same placebo effect as Harry, that\nbackwash of emptiness caressing at his mind.",
      "\"Anthony Goldstein,\" called the voice of the Headmaster.",
      "Harry quietly walked toward Seamus, even as Anthony began to\napproach the shining silver phoenix, and... whatever it was beneath\nthe tattered cloak.",
      "\"What did you see?\" Harry asked Seamus in a low voice.",
      "A lot of students hadn't answered Harry, when he'd tried to\ngather the data; but Seamus was Finnigan of Chaos, one of Harry's\nlieutenants. Maybe that wasn't fair, but...",
      "\"Dead,\" said Seamus in a whisper, \"grayish and slimy... dead and\nleft in water for a while... \"",
      "Harry nodded. \"That's what a lot of people see,\" Harry said. He\nprojected confidence, even though it was fake, because Seamus\nneeded it. \"Go eat some chocolate, you'll feel better.\"",
      "Seamus nodded and stumbled off toward the table of healing\nsweets.",
      "\"Expecto Patronum!\u202f\" cried a young boy's voice.",
      "Then there were gasps of shock, even from the Aurors.",
      "Harry spun around to look -",
      "There was a brilliant silver bird standing between Anthony\nGoldstein and the cage. The bird reared its head and let out a cry,\nand the cry was also silver, as bright and hard and beautiful as\nmetal.",
      "And something in the back of Harry's mind said, if that's a\nperegrine falcon, I'm going to strangle him in his sleep.",
      "Shut up, Harry said to the thought, do you want us\nto be a Dark Wizard?",
      "What's the point? You're going to end up as one\neventually.",
      "That... wasn't something Harry would usually have thought...",
      "It's a placebo effect, Harry told himself again.\nThe Dementor can't actually get to me through three corporeal\nPatronuses, I'm just imagining what I think it's like. When I\nactually face the Dementor, it'll feel completely different, and\nthen I'll know I was just being silly before.",
      "A slight chill went down Harry's spine then, because he had a\nfeeling that yes, it would be completely different, and\nnot in a positive direction.",
      "The blazing silver phoenix sprang back into existence from the\nHeadmaster's wand, the lesser bird vanished; and Anthony Goldstein\nbegan to walk back.",
      "The Headmaster was coming with Anthony instead of calling out\nthe next name, the Patronus waiting behind to guard the\nDementor.",
      "Harry glanced over to where Hermione was standing, just behind\nthe glowing panther. Hermione's turn would have come next, but had\napparently just been delayed.",
      "She looked stressed.",
      "Earlier, she'd politely asked Harry to please stop trying to\ndestress her.",
      "Dumbledore was smiling slightly as he escorted Anthony back\ntoward the others; smiling only slightly, because the Headmaster\nlooked very, very tired.",
      "\"Unbelievable,\" said Dumbledore in a voice that sounded much\nweaker than his accustomed boom. \"A corporeal Patronus, in his\nfirst year. And an astounding number of successes among the other\nyoung students. Quirinus, I must acknowledge that you have proved\nyour point.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell inclined his head. \"A simple enough guess, I\nshould think. A Dementor attacks through fear, and children are\nless afraid.\"",
      "\"Less afraid?\" said Auror Goryanof from where he was\nsitting.",
      "\"So I said as well,\" said Dumbledore. \"And Professor Quirrell\npointed out that adults had more courage, not less to fear; which\nthought, I confess, had never occurred to me before.\"",
      "\"That was not my precise phrasing,\" Professor Quirrell\nsaid dryly, \"but it will do. And the rest of our agreement,\nHeadmaster?\"",
      "\"As you say,\" Dumbledore said reluctantly. \"I admit I was not\nexpecting to lose that wager, Quirinus, but you have proven your\nwisdom.\"",
      "All the students were looking at them, puzzled; except Hermione,\nwho was staring in the direction of the cage and the tall decaying\nrobes; and Harry, who was watching everyone, since he was imagining\nhimself feeling paranoid.",
      "Professor Quirrell said, in tones that did not invite further\ncomments, \"I am allowed to teach the Killing Curse to students who\nwish to learn it. Which will render them considerably safer from\nDark Wizards and other pests, and it is foolish to think they will\notherwise know no deadly magics.\" Professor Quirrell paused, his\neyes narrowing. \"Headmaster, I respectfully observe that you are\nnot looking well. I suggest leaving the remainder of the day's task\nto Professor Flitwick.\"",
      "Dumbledore shook his head. \"We are almost done for the day,\nQuirinus. I will last.\"",
      "Hermione had approached Anthony. \"Captain Goldstein,\" she said,\nand her voice trembled only a little, \"can you give me any\nadvice?\"",
      "\"Don't be afraid,\" Anthony said firmly. \"Don't think about\nanything it tries to make you think about. You're not just holding\nup the wand in front of you as a shield against the fear, you're\nbrandishing your wand to drive the fear away, that's how\nyou make a happy thought into something solid...\" Anthony shrugged\nhelplessly. \"I mean, I heard all that before, but...\"",
      "Other students were starting to congregate around Anthony, with\ntheir own questions.",
      "\"Miss Granger?\" the Headmaster said. His voice might have been\ngentle, or just weakened.",
      "Hermione straightened her shoulders, and followed him.",
      "\"What did you see under the cloak?\" Harry said to Anthony.",
      "Anthony looked at Harry, surprised, and then answered, \"A very\ntall man who was dead, I mean, sort of dead-shaped and\ndead-colored... it hurt to see him and I knew that was the Dementor\ntrying to get at me.\"",
      "Harry looked back out at where Hermione was confronting the cage\nand the cloak.",
      "Hermione raised her wand into position for the first\ngestures.",
      "The Headmaster's phoenix winked out of existence.",
      "And Hermione gave a tiny, pathetic shriek, flinched -",
      "- took a step back, Harry could see her wand moving, and then\nshe brandished it and said \"Expecto Patronum!\"",
      "Nothing happened.",
      "Hermione turned and ran.",
      "\"Expecto Patronum!\u202f\" said the Headmaster's deeper\nvoice, and the silver phoenix blazed back to life.",
      "The young girl stumbled, and kept running, strange sounds\nbeginning to come from her throat.",
      "\"Hermione!\u202f\" Susan yelled it, and Hannah, and Daphne,\nand Ernie, and they all started to run toward her; even as Harry,\nwho was always thinking one step ahead, spun on his own heel and\nran for the table with the chocolate.",
      "Even after Harry had shoved the chocolate into Hermione's mouth\nand she'd chewed and swallowed, she was still breathing in great\ngasps and crying, her eyes still seemed unfocused.",
      "She can't have been permanently Demented, Harry thought\ndesperately at the confusion inside him, the horrible fear and\ndeathly fury beginning to twist around each other, she can't\nhave been, she wasn't exposed for even ten seconds let alone forty\n-",
      "But she could be temporarily Demented, as Harry\nrealized in that moment, there wasn't any rule that you couldn't be\ntemporarily injured by a Dementor in just ten seconds if\nyou were sensitive enough.",
      "Then Hermione's eyes seemed to focus, and dart around, and\nsettle on him.",
      "\"Harry,\" she gasped, and the other students went silent. \"Harry,\ndon't. Don't!\u202f\"",
      "Harry was suddenly afraid to ask what he shouldn't do, was\nhe in her worst memories, or some sleep's nightmare that\nshe was now reliving in waking life?",
      "\"Don't go near it!\" said Hermione. Her hand reached\nout, grabbed him by the lapel of his robes. \"You mustn't go near\nit, Harry! It spoke to me, Harry, it knows you, it knows you're\nhere!\u202f\"",
      "\"What -\" Harry said, and then cursed himself for asking.",
      "\"The Dementor!\u202f\" said Hermione. Her voice rose to a\nshriek. \"Professor Quirrell wants it to eat you!\u202f\"",
      "In the sudden hush, Professor Quirrell came forward a few steps;\nbut he didn't approach any closer (Harry was there, after all).\n\"Miss Granger,\" he said, and his voice was grave, \"I think you\nshould have some more chocolate.\"",
      "\"Professor Flitwick, don't let Harry try, send him\nback!\u202f\"",
      "The Headmaster had arrived by then, and he and Professor\nFlitwick were exchanging worried looks.",
      "\"I did not hear the Dementor speak,\" the Headmaster said.\n\"Still...\"",
      "\"Just ask,\" said Professor Quirrell, sounding a little\nweary.",
      "\"Did the Dementor say how it would get to Harry?\" said\nthe Headmaster.",
      "\"All his tastiest parts first,\" said Hermione, \"it would - it\nwould eat -\"",
      "Hermione blinked. Some sanity seemed to come back into her\neyes.",
      "Then she started crying.",
      "\"You were too brave, Hermione Granger,\" the Headmaster said. His\nvoice was gentle, and clearly audible. \"Too much braver than I\ncomprehended. You should have turned and run, not endured and tried\nto complete your Charm. When you are older and stronger, Miss\nGranger, I know that you will try again, and I know that you will\nsucceed.\"",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" Hermione said in gasps, \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm\nsorry... I'm sorry, Harry, I can't tell you what I saw, I didn't\nlook at it, I didn't dare look at it, I knew it was too horrible to\never be seen...\"",
      "It should have been Harry, but he'd hesitated, because his hands\nwere all chocolatey; and then Ernie and Susan were there, helping\nHermione from where she'd fallen on the grass, leading her toward\nthe snacks table.",
      "Five bars of chocolate later, Hermione seemed to be all right\nagain, and she went over and apologized to Professor Quirrell; but\nshe was always watching Harry, every time that he glanced in her\ndirection. He'd stepped toward her only once, and stopped when\nshe'd stepped away. Her eyes had silently apologized, and silently\npleaded for him to leave her be.",
      "Neville Longbottom had seen something dead and half-dissolved,\noozing and running with a face like a squashed sponge.",
      "It was the worst thing anyone had yet described seeing. Neville\nhad been able to produce a small flicker of light from his wand\nbefore, but he had, intelligently and with great presence of mind,\nturned and run away instead of trying to cast his own Patronus\nCharm.",
      "(The Headmaster had said nothing to the other students, told no\none else to be less brave; but Professor Quirrell had calmly\nobserved that if you made the mistake after being warned,\nthat was when ignorance became stupidity.)",
      "\"Professor Quirrell?\" Harry said in a low voice, having come as\nclose to the Defense Professor as he dared. \"What do you\nsee when you -\"",
      "\"Don't ask.\" The voice was very flat.",
      "Harry nodded respectfully. \"What was your original\nphrasing to the Headmaster, if I can ask?\"",
      "Dryly. \"Our worst memories can only grow worse as we grow\nolder.\"",
      "\"Ah,\" Harry said. \"Logical.\"",
      "Something strange flickered in Professor Quirrell's eyes, then,\nas he looked at Harry. \"Let us hope,\" Professor Quirrell said,\n\"that you succeed upon this try, Mr. Potter. For if you do, the\nHeadmaster may teach you his trick of using a Patronus to send\nmessages that cannot be forged or intercepted, and the military\nimportance of that is impossible to overstate. It would be a\ntremendous advantage to the Chaos Legion, and someday, I suspect,\nthis entire country. But if you do not succeed, Mr.\nPotter... well, I shall understand.\"",
      "Morag MacDougal had said, in a wavering voice, \"Ouch\", and\nDumbledore had recast his Patronus right away.",
      "Parvati Patil had produced a corporeal Patronus in the form of a\ntiger, larger than Dumbledore's phoenix, though not nearly as\nbright. There had been a great burst of applause from all the\nwatchers, though not the same shock as when Anthony had done\nit.",
      "And then it was Harry's turn.",
      "The Headmaster called the name of Harry Potter, and Harry was\nafraid.",
      "Harry knew, he knew that he was going to fail, and he knew that\nit was going to hurt.",
      "But he still had to try; because sometimes, in the presence of a\nDementor, a wizard went from not a flicker of light to a full\ncorporeal Patronus, and no one understood why.",
      "And because if Harry couldn't defend himself from\nDementors, he had to be able to recognize their approach, recognize\nthe feeling of them in his mind, and run before it was too\nlate.",
      "What is my worst memory...?",
      "Harry had expected the Headmaster to give him a worried look, or\na hopeful look, or deeply wise advice; but instead Albus Dumbledore\nonly watched him with quiet calm.",
      "He thinks I'm going to fail, but he won't sabotage me by\ntelling me so, thought Harry, if he had true words of\nencouragement to speak, he would speak them...",
      "The cage came closer. It was already tarnished, but not rusted\naway to nothing, not yet.",
      "The cloak came closer. It was unraveling and shot through with\nunpatched holes; it had been new that morning, Auror Goryanof had\nsaid.",
      "\"Headmaster?\" Harry said. \"What do you see?\"",
      "The Headmaster's voice was also calm. \"The Dementors are\ncreatures of fear, and as your fear of the Dementor diminishes, so\ndoes the fearsomeness of its form. I see a tall, thin, naked man.\nHe is not decaying. He is only slightly painful to look upon. That\nis all. What do you see, Harry?\"",
      "...Harry couldn't see under the cloak.",
      "Or that wasn't right, it was that his mind was refusing\nto see what was under the cloak...",
      "No, his mind was trying to see the wrong thing under\nthe cloak, Harry could feel it, his eyes trying to force a mistake.\nBut Harry had done his best to train himself to notice that tiny\nfeeling of confusion, to automatically flinch away from making\nstuff up; and every time his mind tried to start inventing a lie\nabout what was under the cloak, that reflex was fast enough to shut\nit down.",
      "Harry looked under the cloak and saw...",
      "An open question. Harry wouldn't let his mind see something\nfalse, and so he didn't see anything, like the part of his visual\ncortex getting that signal was just ceasing to exist. There was a\nblind spot under the cloak. Harry couldn't know what was under\nthere.",
      "Just that it was far worse than any decaying mummy.",
      "The unseeable horror beneath the cloak was very close, now, but\nthe blazing bird of moonlight, the white phoenix, yet lay between\nthem.",
      "Harry wanted to run away like some of the other students had.\nHalf the ones who'd had no luck with their Patronus Charms just\nhadn't shown up today in the first place. Of those remaining, half\nhad fled before the Headmaster had even dispelled his own Patronus,\nand no one had said a word. There'd been a little laughter when\nTerry had turned and walked back before his own try; and Susan and\nHannah, who'd gone before, had yelled at everyone to shut up.",
      "But Harry was the Boy-Who-Lived, and he would lose much respect\nif he was seen to give up without even trying...",
      "Pride and roles seemed to diminish and fall away, in the\npresence of whatever lay beneath the cloak.",
      "Why am I still here?",
      "It wasn't the shame of others thinking him cowardly, that kept\nHarry's feet in place.",
      "It wasn't the hope of repairing his reputation that brought up\nhis wand.",
      "It wasn't the desire to master the Patronus Charm as magic, that\nmoved his fingers into the initial position.",
      "It was something else, something that had to oppose\nwhatever lay beneath the cloak, this was the true darkness and\nHarry had to find out whether it lay within him, the power to drive\nit back.",
      "Harry had planned to try one final time to think of his\nbook-shopping spree with his father, but instead, at the last\nminute, facing the Dementor, a different memory occurred to him,\nsomething he hadn't tried before; a thought that wasn't warm and\nhappy in the ordinary way, but felt righter, somehow.",
      "And Harry remembered the stars, remembered them burning terribly\nbright and unwavering in the Silent Night; he let that image fill\nhim, fill all of him like an Occlumency barrier across his entire\nmind, became once again the bodiless awareness of the void.",
      "The bright silver shining phoenix vanished.",
      "And the Dementor smashed into his mind like the fist of God.",
      "FEAR / COLD / DARKNESS",
      "There was an instant when the two forces clashed head-on, when\nthe peaceful starlit memory held its own against the fear, even as\nHarry's fingers began the wand motions, practiced until they had\nbecome automatic. They weren't warm and happy, those blazing points\nof light in perfect blackness; but it was an image the Dementor\ncould not easily pierce. For the silent burning stars were vast and\nunafraid, and to shine in the cold and darkness was their natural\nstate.",
      "But there was a flaw, a crack, a fault-line in the immovable\nobject trying to resist that irresistible force. Harry felt a\ntwinge of anger at the Dementor for trying to feed on him, and it\nwas like slipping on wet ice. Harry's mind began to slide sideways,\ninto bitterness, black fury, deathly hatred -",
      "Harry's wand came up in the final brandish.",
      "It felt wrong.",
      "\"Expecto Patronum,\" his voice spoke, the words hollow and\npointless.",
      "And Harry fell into his dark side, fell down into his dark side,\nfurther and faster and deeper than ever before, down down down as\nthe slide accelerated, as the Dementor latched onto the exposed and\nvulnerable parts and fed on them, eating away the light. A fading\nreflex scrabbled for warmth, but even as an image of Hermione came\nto him, or an image of Mum and Dad, the Dementor twisted it, showed\nhim Hermione lying dead on the ground, the corpses of his mother\nand father, and then even that was sucked away.",
      "Into the vacuum rose the memory, the worst memory, something\nforgotten so long ago that the neural patterns shouldn't have still\nexisted.",
      "\"Lily, take Harry and go! It's him!\" shouted a man's voice.\n\"Go! Run! I'll hold him off!\"",
      "And Harry couldn't help but think, in the empty depths of\nhis dark side, how ridiculously overconfident James Potter had\nbeen. Hold off Lord Voldemort? With what?",
      "Then the other voice spoke, high-pitched like the hiss of a\nteakettle, and it was like dry ice laid on Harry's every nerve,\nlike a brand of metal cooled to liquid helium temperatures and laid\non every part of him. And the voice said:",
      "\"Avadakedavra.\"",
      "(The wand flew from the boy's nerveless fingers as his body\nbegan to convulse and fall, the Headmaster's eyes widening in alarm\nas he began his own Patronus Charm.)",
      "\"Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!\" screamed the\nwoman's voice.",
      "Whatever was left of Harry listened with all the light\ndrained out of him, in the dead void of his heart, and wondered if\nshe thought that Lord Voldemort would stop because she asked\npolitely.",
      "\"Step aside, woman!\" said the shrill voice of burning cold.\n\"For you I am not come, only the boy.\"",
      "\"Not Harry! Please... have mercy... have mercy...\"",
      "Lily Potter, Harry thought, seemed not to understand what\ntype of people became Dark Lords in the first place; and if this\nwas the best strategy she could conceive to save her child's life,\nthat was her final failure as a mother.",
      "\"I give you this rare chance to flee,\" said the shrill\nvoice. \"But I will not trouble myself to subdue you, and your death\nhere will not save your child. Step aside, foolish woman, if you\nhave any sense in you at all!\"",
      "\"Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead!\"",
      "The empty thing that was Harry wondered if Lily Potter\nseriously imagined that Lord Voldemort would say yes, kill her, and\nthen depart leaving her son unharmed.",
      "\"Very well,\" said the voice of death, now sounding coldly\namused, \"I accept the bargain. Yourself to die, and the child to\nlive. Now drop your wand so that I can murder you.\"",
      "There was a hideous silence.",
      "Lord Voldemort began to laugh, horrible contemptuous\nlaughter.",
      "And then, at last, Lily Potter's voice shrieked in desperate\nhate, \"Avada ke-\"",
      "The lethal voice finished first, the curse rapid and\nprecise.",
      "\"Avadakedavra.\"",
      "A blinding flare of green marked the end of Lily\nPotter.",
      "And the boy in the crib saw it, the eyes, those two crimson\neyes, seeming to glow bright red, to blaze like miniature suns,\nfilling Harry's whole vision as they locked to his own -",
      "The other children saw Harry Potter fall, they heard Harry\nPotter scream, a thin high-pitched scream that seemed to pierce\ntheir ears like knives.",
      "There was a brilliant silver flash as the Headmaster bellowed\n\"Expecto Patronum!\u202f\" and the blazing phoenix returned to\nbeing.",
      "But Harry Potter's horrible scream went on and on and on, even\nas the Headmaster scooped up the boy in his arms and bore him away\nfrom the Dementor, even as Neville Longbottom and Professor\nFlitwick both went for the chocolate at the same time and -",
      "Hermione knew it, she knew it as she saw it, she knew that her\nnightmare had been real, it was coming true, somehow it was coming\ntrue.",
      "\"Get him chocolate!\" demanded the voice of Professor Quirrell,\npointlessly, because Professor Flitwick's tiny form was already\ncannonballing toward where the Headmaster was racing toward the\nstudents.",
      "Hermione was moving forward herself, though she didn't know what\nelse she meant to do -",
      "\"Cast Patronuses!\u202f\" shouted the Headmaster, as he\nbrought Harry behind the Aurors. \"Everyone who can! Get them\nbetween Harry and the Dementor! It's still feeding on\nhim!\u202f\"",
      "There was a moment of frozen horror.",
      "\"Expecto Patronum!\u202f\" shouted Professor Flitwick and\nAuror Goryanof, and then Anthony Goldstein, but he failed the first\ntime, and then Parvati Patil, who succeeded, and then Anthony tried\nagain and his silver bird spread its wings and screamed at the\nDementor, and Dean Thomas roared the words like they had been\nwritten in letters of fire and his wand gave birth to a towering\nwhite bear; there were eight blazing Patronuses all in a line\nbetween Harry and the Dementor, and Harry went on screaming and\nscreaming as the Headmaster laid him on the dried grass.",
      "Hermione couldn't cast a Patronus Charm, so she ran toward where\nHarry lay. In her mind, something tried to guess how long it had\nbeen already. Was it twenty seconds? More?",
      "There was a dreadful agony and bewilderment on the face of Albus\nDumbledore. His long black wand was in his hand, but he spoke no\nspells, only looked down at Harry's convulsing body in horror -",
      "Hermione didn't know what to do, she didn't know what to do, she\ndidn't understand what was happening, and the most powerful wizard\nin the world seemed equally at a loss.",
      "\"Use your phoenix!\u202f\" bellowed Professor Quirrell.\n\"Take him far away from that Dementor!\u202f\"",
      "Without a single word the Headmaster scooped up Harry in his\narms and vanished in a crack of fire along with the suddenly\nappearing Fawkes; and the Headmaster's Patronus winked out, where\nit had guarded the Dementor.",
      "Horror and confusion and sudden babble.",
      "\"Mr. Potter should recover,\" Professor Quirrell said, raising\nhis voice, but his tone now calm once again, \"I think it was just\nover twenty seconds.\"",
      "Then the blazing white phoenix appeared again, like it was\nflying before them from elsewhere, to Hermione Granger came the\ncreature of moonlight, and it cried to her in Albus Dumbledore's\nvoice:",
      "\"It still feeds on him, even here! How? If you know,\nHermione Granger, you must tell me! Tell me!\u202f\"",
      "The senior Auror turned to stare at her, and so did many\nstudents. Professor Flitwick didn't turn, he was now leveling his\nwand on Professor Quirrell, who was holding out clearly empty\nhands.",
      "Seconds ticked past, uncounted.",
      "She couldn't remember it, she couldn't remember the nightmare\nclearly, she couldn't remember why she had thought it was possible,\nwhy she had been afraid -",
      "Hermione realized then what she ought to do, and it was the\nhardest decision of her life.",
      "What if whatever had happened to Harry, happened to her too?",
      "All her limbs cold as death, her vision gone dark, fear\noverwhelming everything; she'd seen Harry dying, Mum and Dad dying,\nall her friends dying, everyone dying, so that in the end, when she\ndied, she would be alone. That was her secret nightmare she'd never\ntalked about with anyone, that had given the Dementor its power\nover her, the loneliest thing was to die alone.",
      "She didn't want to go to that place again, she, she didn't, she\ndidn't want to stay there forever -",
      "You have courage enough for Gryffindor, said the calm\nvoice of the Sorting Hat in her memory, but you will do what is\nright in any House I give you. You will learn, you will stand by\nyour friends, in any House you choose. So don't be afraid, Hermione\nGranger, just decide where you belong...",
      "There was no time for deciding, Harry was dying.",
      "\"I can't remember now,\" said Hermione, her voice cracking, \"but\njust hold on, I'll go in front of the Dementor again...\"",
      "She started to run toward the Dementor.",
      "\"Miss Granger!\" squeaked Professor Flitwick, but he made no move\nto stop her, only kept holding his wand on Professor Quirrell.",
      "\"Everyone!\u202f\" shouted Auror Komodo in a voice of\nmilitary command. \"Get your Patronuses out of her\nway!\u202f\"",
      "\"FLITWICK!\u202f\" roared Professor Quirrell. \"SUMMON\nPOTTER'S WAND!\u202f\"",
      "Even as Hermione understood, Professor Flitwick was already\ncrying \"Accio!\u202f\", and she saw the stick of wood zooming up\nfrom where it had lain almost touching the Dementor's cage.",
      "The eyes opened, dead and vacant.",
      "\"Harry!\u202f\" gasped a voice in the colorless world.\n\"Harry! Speak to me!\u202f\"",
      "The face of Albus Dumbledore leaned over into the field of\nvision, which had been occupied by a distant marble ceiling.",
      "\"You're annoying,\" said the empty voice. \"You should die.\""

      "Professor Flitwick whispered to his silver raven, and it flew\ninto the air and vanished.",

      "There were more students gathering around where the Headmaster\nwatched over Harry with grim eyes: Neville, Seamus, Dean, Lavender,\nErnie, Terry, Anthony, none of them daring to approach any closer\nthan Hermione had.",
      "\"What can we do?\" said Dean in a trembling voice.",
      "\"Back off and give him more space -\" said the dry voice of\nProfessor Quirrell.",
      "\"No!\" interrupted the Headmaster. \"Let him be surrounded by his\nfriends.\"",
      "Harry swallowed his chocolate, and said in that empty voice,\n\"They're stupid. They should diemmmppphhh\" as another\npiece of chocolate entered his mouth.",
      "Hermione saw the looks of shock that crossed their faces.",
      "\"He doesn't mean it, does he?\" Seamus said it like he was\nbegging.",
      "\"You don't understand,\" Hermione said, her voice breaking,\n\"that's not Harry -\" and she shut up before she said\nanything more, but she had to say that much.",
      "She saw from the look on his face that Neville understood, and\nshe also saw that the others didn't. If Harry had really never\nthought anything like that, then being exposed to a Dementor for\nless than a minute wouldn't have made him say it. That's what they\nwere probably thinking.",
      "Less than a minute of Dementor exposure couldn't create a whole\nnew evil person inside you out of nothing.",
      "But if that person was already there -",
      "Does the Headmaster know?",
      "Hermione looked up at the Headmaster, and found that Albus\nDumbledore was gazing at her, and that his blue eyes had\ngrown suddenly piercing -",

      "Do not speak of it, said the will of Dumbledore to\nher.",

      "Now Hermione was getting really nervous. She didn't\nknow how much the Headmaster knew about Harry's dark side\n-",
      "A fair point, sent the Headmaster. I am about to\ntell you; steel yourself so as not to react. Are you ready? Good. I\nam going to pretend to cast the Killing Curse on Professor\nMcGonagall - DO NOT REACT, Hermione!",
      "That took work. The Headmaster really was crazy! That wouldn't\nbring Harry out of his dark side, Harry would go\ncompletely berserk, he'd kill the Headmaster\n-",

      "The thought came to Hermione -",
      "I doubt that will work, sent the Headmaster, and\nyou may not like the way he reacts if you try. But you may try if\nyou wish.",
      "She hadn't really meant that seriously! It was too -",
      "Then her eyes moved, breaking gaze with the Headmaster, going to\nthe boy looking around with empty, despising eyes as his mouth kept\nchewing and swallowing bar after bar of chocolate without effect.\nHer heart wrenched, and suddenly a lot of things didn't seem to\nmatter, only that there was a chance.",
      "There was a compulsion to chew and swallow chocolate. The\nresponse to compulsion was killing.",
      "People had gathered around and stared. That was annoying. The\nresponse to annoyance was killing.",
      "Other people were chattering in the background. That was\ninsolent. The response to insolence was to inflict pain, but since\nnone of them were useful, killing them would be simpler.",
      "Killing all those people would be difficult. But many of them\ndidn't trust Quirrell, who was strong. Finding exactly the right\ntrigger could cause them all to kill each other.",
      "Then a person leaned over into the field of vision and did\nsomething completely strange, something that belonged to a foreign\nmode of thought, for which there was only a single response stored\nanywhere -",
      "She heard the gasps around her, and they didn't matter, she\nmaintained the kiss on those chocolate-smeared lips as the tears\nwelled in her eyes.",

      "\"I think he'll be all right now,\" the Headmaster said, looking\nat where Harry was crying in great wretched sobs as Fawkes crooned\nover him. \"Excellently done, Miss Granger. Do you know, not even I\nwould have expected that to actually work?\"",

There\nwere terrible things that had happened to him, terrible thoughts\nthat had passed through him. He had regained an impossible memory,\nfor all that the Dementor had made him desecrate it. A strange word\nkept echoing in his mind. And all of that could be put on hold for\nlater, while the phoenix still shone red and gold beneath the\nsetting sun.",

Had the\nHeadmaster calculated that, when he had let the other students stay\nand watch?",
      "Harry's eyes went back to the tall tattered cloak, almost\nabsentmindedly, and without really being aware of what he was\nspeaking, Harry said, \"It shouldn't ought to exist.\"",
      "\"Ah,\" said a dry, precise voice. \"I thought you might say that.\nI am very sorry to tell you, Mr. Potter, that Dementors cannot be\nkilled. Many have tried.\"",
      "\"Really?\" Harry said, still absentmindedly. \"What did they\ntry?\"",
      "\"There is a certain extremely dangerous and destructive spell,\"\nProfessor Quirrell said, \"which I will not name here; a spell of\ncursed fire. It is what you would use to destroy an ancient device\nsuch as the Sorting Hat. It has no effect on Dementors. They are\nundying.\"",
      "\"They are not undying,\" said the Headmaster. The words mild, the\ngaze sharp. \"They do not possess eternal life. They are wounds in\nthe world, and attacking a wound only makes it larger.\"",
      "\"Hm,\" Harry said. \"Suppose you threw it into the Sun? Would it\nbe destroyed?\"",
      "\"Throw it into the Sun?\u202f\" squeaked Professor\nFlitwick, looking like he wanted to faint.",
      "\"It seems unlikely, Mr. Potter,\" Professor Quirrell said dryly.\n\"The Sun is very large, after all; I doubt the Dementor would have\nmuch effect on it. But it is not a test I would like to try, Mr.\nPotter, just in case.\"",
      "\"I see,\" Harry said.",
      "Fawkes cawed a final time, mantled his wings around Harry's\nhead, and then launched himself from Harry.

The Defense Professor\npointed out that, despite the understandable emotions of all\nconcerned, the chance of a similar mishap occurring to any other\nstudent verged on the infinitesimal; the more so as they now knew\nto avoid mischances with wands. And meanwhile, there were other\nstudents who needed to take their own best chance at casting a\ncorporeal Patronus Charm, or else learn the feeling of a Dementor\nso they could flee, and discover their own degree of\nvulnerability...",
      "In the end it turned out that Dean Thomas and Ron Weasley of\nGryffindor were the only ones left who were still willing to go\nanywhere near the Dementor, which simplified the argument.",

Harry told her that he needed to talk to her afterward and\nask a question he'd put off for a while, but that didn't need to\nhappen right now, if she was busy. There was a certain look about\nher which suggested that she had been pulled away from something\nimportant; and Harry observed this to her, and said that she\nhonestly didn't need to feel guilty about leaving. This earned him\nsomething of a sharp look, but then leave she did, hurriedly, with\na promise that they would talk later.",
      "Dean Thomas cast his white bear again, even in the Dementor's\npresence; and Ron Weasley put up an adequate shield of sparkling\nmist. Which concluded the day, so far as everyone else was\nconcerned, and Professor Flitwick began to herd the students back\nto Hogwarts. When it was clear that Harry meant to stay behind,\nProfessor Flitwick looked at him quizzically; and Harry, for his\npart, glanced significantly at Dumbledore. Harry didn't know what\nProfessor Flitwick made of that, but after a sharp gaze of warning,\nhis Head of House departed.",
      "And so remained only Harry, Professor Quirrell, Headmaster\nDumbledore, and an Auror trio.",
      "It would have been better to get rid of the trio first, but\nHarry couldn't think of a good way to do that.",
      "\"All right,\" said Auror Komodo, \"let's take it back.\"",
      "\"Excuse me,\" Harry said. \"I'd like to have another go at the\nDementor.\"",
      "Harry's request met with a certain amount of opposition of the\nyou're completely insane variety, though it was only Auror\nButnaru who actually said that out loud.",
      "\"Fawkes told me to,\" Harry said.",
      "This did not overcome all the opposition, despite the look of\nshock it produced on Dumbledore's face. The argument went on, and\nit was starting to wear the edges off the phoenix's remaining\npeace, which annoyed Harry, though only a little.",
      "\"Look,\" Harry said, \"I'm pretty sure I know what I was doing\nwrong before. There's a kind of person who has to use a different\nsort of warm and happy thought. Just let me try it, okay?\"",
      "This did not prove persuasive either.",
      "\"I think,\" Professor Quirrell said finally, staring at Harry\nwith narrowed eyes, \"that if we do not allow him to do this under\nsupervision, he may, at some point or another, sneak off and look\nfor a Dementor on his own. Do I accuse you falsely, Mr.\nPotter?\"",
      "There was an appalled pause at this. It seemed like a good time\nto play his trump card.",
      "\"I don't mind if the Headmaster keeps his own Patronus up,\"\nHarry said. For I will be in the presence of a Dementor just\nthe same, Patronus or no.",
      "There was confusion at this, even Professor Quirrell looked\npuzzled; but the Headmaster finally acceded, since it didn't seem\nlikely that Harry could be hurt through four Patronuses.",
      "If the Dementor could not reach through your Patronus on\nsome level, Albus Dumbledore, you would not see a naked man painful\nto look upon...",
      "Harry didn't say it out loud, for obvious reasons.",
      "And they began to walk toward the Dementor.",
      "\"Headmaster,\" Harry said, \"suppose the Ravenclaw door asked you\nthis riddle: What lies at the center of a Dementor? What would you\nsay?\"",
      "\"Fear,\" said the Headmaster.",
      "It was a simple enough mistake. The Dementor approached, and the\nfear came over you. The fear hurt, you felt the fear weakening you,\nyou wanted the fear to go away.",
      "It was natural to think the fear was the problem.",
      "So they'd concluded that the Dementor was a creature of pure\nfear, that there was nothing there to fear but fear itself, that\nthe Dementor couldn't hurt you if you weren't afraid...",
      "But...",
      "What lies at the center of a Dementor?",
      "Fear.",
      "What is so horrible that the mind refuses to see\nit?",
      "Fear.",
      "What is impossible to kill?",
      "Fear.",
      "...it didn't quite fit, once you thought about it.",
      "Though it was clear enough why people would be reluctant to look\nbeyond the first answer.",
      "People understood fear.",
      "People knew what they were supposed to do about\nfear.",
      "So, faced with a Dementor, it wouldn't exactly be comforting to\nask: 'What if the fear is just a side effect rather than the main\nproblem?'",
      "They had come very close to the Dementor's cage guarded by four\nPatronuses, when there came sharp intakes of breath from the three\nAurors and Professor Quirrell. Everyone's faces turned to look at\nthe Dementor, seeming to listen; there was horror on Auror\nGoryanof's face.",
      "Then Professor Quirrell raised his head, his face hard, and spat\ntoward the Dementor.",
      "\"It did not like having its prey taken from it, I suppose,\"\nDumbledore said quietly. \"Well. If it becomes necessary, Quirinus,\nthere will always be a refuge for you at Hogwarts.\"",
      "\"What did it say?\" said Harry.",
      "Every head swung to stare at him.",
      "\"You didn't hear it...?\" Dumbledore said.",
      "Harry shook his head.",
      "\"It said to me,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"that it knew me, and\nthat it would hunt me down someday, wherever I tried to hide.\" His\nface was rigid, showing no fright.",
      "\"Ah,\" Harry said. \"I wouldn't worry about that, Professor\nQuirrell.\" It's not like Dementors can actually talk, or think;\nthe structure they have is borrowed from your own mind and\nexpectations...",
      "Now everyone was giving him very strange looks. The\nAurors were glancing nervously at each other, at the Dementor, at\nHarry.",
      "And they stood directly before the Dementor's cage.",
      "\"They are wounds in the world,\" Harry said. \"It's just a wild\nguess, but I'm guessing the one who said that was Godric\nGryffindor.\"",
      "\"Yes...\" said Dumbledore. \"How did you know?\"",
      "It is a common misconception, thought Harry, that\nall the best rationalists are Sorted into Ravenclaw, leaving none\nfor other Houses. This is not so; being Sorted into Ravenclaw\nindicates that your strongest virtue is curiosity, wondering and\ndesiring to know the true answer. And this is not the only\nvirtue a rationalist needs. Sometimes you have to work hard on\na problem, and stick to it for a while. Sometimes you need a clever\nplan for finding out. And sometimes what you need more than\nanything else to see an answer, is the courage to face\nit...",
      "Harry's gaze went to what lay beneath the cloak, the horror far\nworse than any decaying mummy. Rowena Ravenclaw might also have\nknown, for it was an obvious enough riddle once you saw it as a\nriddle.",
      "And it was also obvious why the Patronuses were animals. The\nanimals didn't know, and so were sheltered from the fear.",
      "But Harry knew, and would always know, and would never be able\nto forget. He'd tried to teach himself to face reality without\nflinching, and though Harry had not yet mastered that art, still\nthose grooves had been worn into his mind, the learned reflex to\nlook toward the painful thought instead of away. Harry\nwould never be able to forget by thinking warm happy thoughts about\nsomething else, and that was why the spell hadn't worked for\nhim.",
      "So Harry would think a warm happy thought that wasn't\nabout something else.",
      "Harry drew forth his wand that Professor Flitwick had returned\nto him, put his feet into the beginning stance for the Patronus\nCharm.",
      "Within his mind, Harry discarded the last remnants of the peace\nof the phoenix, put aside the calm, the dreamlike state, remembered\ninstead Fawkes's piercing cry, and roused himself for battle.\nCalled upon all the pieces and elements of himself to awaken.\nRaised up within himself all the strength that the Patronus Charm\ncould ever draw upon, to put himself into the right frame of mind\nfor the final warm and happy thought; remembered all bright\nthings.",
      "The books his father had bought him.",
      "Mum's smile when Harry had handmade her a mother's day card, an\nelaborate thing that had used half a pound of spare electronics\nparts from the garage to flash lights and beep a little tune, and\nhad taken him three days to make.",
      "Professor McGonagall telling him that his parents had died well,\nprotecting him. As they had.",
      "Realizing that Hermione was keeping up with him and even running\nfaster, that they could be true rivals and friends.",
      "Coaxing Draco out of the darkness, watching him slowly move\ntoward the light.",
      "Neville and Seamus and Lavender and Dean and everyone else who\nlooked up to him, everyone that he would have fought to protect if\nanything threatened Hogwarts.",
      "Everything that made life worth living.",
      "His wand rose into the starting position for the Patronus\nCharm.",
      "Harry thought of the stars, the image that had almost held off\nthe Dementor even without a Patronus. Only this time, Harry added\nthe missing ingredient, he'd never truly seen it but he'd seen the\npictures and the video. The Earth, blazing blue and white with\nreflected sunlight as it hung in space, amid the black void and the\nbrilliant points of light. It belonged there, within that image,\nbecause it was what gave everything else its meaning. The Earth was\nwhat made the stars significant, made them more than uncontrolled\nfusion reactions, because it was Earth that would someday colonize\nthe galaxy, and fulfill the promise of the night sky.",
      "Would they still be plagued by Dementors, the children's\nchildren's children, the distant descendants of humankind as they\nstrode from star to star? No. Of course not. The Dementors were\nonly little nuisances, paling into nothingness in the light of that\npromise; not unkillable, not invincible, not even close. You had to\nput up with little nuisances, if you were one of the lucky and\nunlucky few to be born on Earth; on Ancient Earth, as it would be\nremembered someday. That too was part of what it meant to be alive,\nif you were one of the tiny handful of sentient beings born into\nthe beginning of all things, before intelligent life had come fully\ninto its power. That the much vaster future depended on what you\ndid here, now, in the earliest days of dawn, when there was still\nso much darkness to be fought, and temporary nuisances like\nDementors.",
      "Mum and Dad, Hermione's friendship and Draco's journey, Neville\nand Seamus and Lavender and Dean, the blue sky and brilliant Sun\nand all bright things, the Earth, the stars, the promise,\neverything humanity was and everything it would become...",
      "On the wand, Harry's fingers moved into their starting\npositions; he was ready, now, to think the right sort of warm and\nhappy thought.",
      "And Harry's eyes stared directly at that which lay beneath the\ntattered cloak, looked straight at that which had been named\nDementor. The void, the emptiness, the hole in the universe, the\nabsence of color and space, the open drain through which warmth\npoured out of the world.",
      "The fear it exuded stole away all happy thoughts, its closeness\ndrained your power and strength, its kiss would destroy everything\nthat you were.",
      "I know you now, Harry thought as his wand twitched\nonce, twice, thrice and four times, as his fingers slid exactly the\nright distances, I comprehend your nature, you symbolize Death,\nthrough some law of magic you are a shadow that Death casts into\nthe world.",
      "And Death is not something I will ever embrace.",
      "It is only a childish thing, that the human species has not\nyet outgrown.",
      "And someday...",
      "We'll get over it...",
      "And people won't have to say goodbye any more...",
      "The wand rose up and leveled straight at the Dementor.",
      "\"EXPECTO PATRONUM!\"",
      "The thought exploded from him like a breaking dam, surged down\nhis arm into his wand, burst from it as blazing white light. Light\nthat became corporeal, took on shape and substance.",
      "A figure with two arms, two legs, and a head, standing upright;\nthe animal Homo sapiens, the shape of a human being.",
      "Glowing brighter and brighter as Harry poured all his strength\ninto his spell, blazing with incandescent light brighter than the\nfading sunset, the Aurors and Professor Quirrell shielding their\neyes in shock -",
      "And someday when the descendants of humanity have spread\nfrom star to star, they won't tell the children about the history\nof Ancient Earth until they're old enough to bear it; and when they\nlearn they'll weep to hear that such a thing as Death had ever once\nexisted!",
      "The figure of a human shone more brilliant now than the noonday\nSun, so radiant that Harry could feel the warmth of it on his skin;\nand Harry sent out all his defiance at the shadow of Death, opening\nall the floodgates inside him to make that bright shape blaze even\nbrighter and yet brighter.",
      "You are not invincible, and someday the human species will\nend you.",
      "I will end you if I can, by the power of mind and magic and\nscience.",
      "I won't cower in fear of Death, not while I have a chance of\nwinning.",
      "I won't let Death touch me, I won't let Death touch the ones\nI love.",
      "And even if you do end me before I end you,",
      "Another will take my place, and another,",
      "Until the wound in the world is healed at last...",
      "Harry lowered his wand, and the bright figure of a human faded\naway.",
      "Slowly, he exhaled.",
      "Like waking up from a dream, like opening his eyes after sleep,\nHarry's gaze moved away from the cage, he looked around and saw\nthat everyone was staring at him.",
      "Albus Dumbledore was staring at him.",
      "Professor Quirrell was staring at him.",
      "The Auror trio was staring at him.",
      "They were all looking at him like they'd just seen him destroy a\nDementor.",
      "The tattered cloak lay empty within the cage."

      "The last tip of the Sun was sinking below the horizon, the red\nlight fading from the treetops, only the blue sky illuminating the\nsix people standing upon the winter-dried and snow-spotted grass,\nnear a vacant cage on whose floor lay an empty, tattered cloak.",
      "Harry felt... well, normal again. Sane-ish. The spell\nhadn't undone the day and its damage, hadn't made the injuries as\nif they had never been, but his hurts had been... bandaged,\nmeliorated? It was hard to describe.",
      "Dumbledore was also looking healthier, though not fully\nrestored. The old wizard's head turned for a moment, locked eyes\nwith Professor Quirrell, then looked back to Harry. \"Harry,\"\nDumbledore said, \"are you about to collapse in exhaustion and\npossibly die?\"",
      "\"No, strangely enough,\" Harry said. \"That took something out of\nme, but a lot less than I thought it would.\" Or maybe it gave\nsomething back, as well as taking... \"Honestly, I expected my\nbody to be hitting the ground with a thud about now.\"",
      "There was a distinct body-hitting-the-ground-with-a-thuddish\nsort of sound.",
      "\"Thank you for taking care of that, Quirinus,\" said Dumbledore\nto Professor Quirrell, who was now standing above and behind the\nunconscious forms of the three Aurors. \"I confess I am still\nfeeling a bit peaky. Though I shall handle the Memory Charms\nmyself.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell inclined his head, and then looked at Harry.\n\"I will omit a good deal of useless incredulity,\" said Professor\nQuirrell, \"remarks to the effect that Merlin himself failed to do\nthat, et cetera. Let us go straight to asking the important\nquestion. What the sweet slithering snakes was that?\u202f\"",
      "\"The Patronus Charm,\" Harry said. \"Version 2.0.\"",
      "\"I rejoice to see that you are your usual self again,\" said\nDumbledore. \"But you are not going anywhere, young\nRavenclaw, until you tell me what exactly was that warm and happy\nthought.\"",
      "\"Hm...\" said Harry. He tapped a contemplative finger on his\ncheek. \"I wonder if I should?\"",
      "Professor Quirrell suddenly grinned.",
      "\"Please?\" said the Headmaster. \"Pretty please with sugar on\ntop?\"",
      "Harry felt an impulse and decided to go with it. It was\ndangerous, but there might not ever be a better opportunity until\nthe end of time.",
      "\"Three sodas,\" Harry said to his pouch, then looked up at the\nDefense Professor and the Headmaster of Hogwarts. \"Gentlemen,\"\nHarry said, \"I bought these sodas on my first visit to Platform\nNine and Three-Quarters, on the day I entered into Hogwarts. I have\nbeen saving them for special occasions; there is a minor\nenchantment on them to ensure they are drunk at the right time.\nThis is the last of my supply, but I do not think there will ever\ncome a finer occasion. Shall we?\"",
      "Dumbledore took a soda can from Harry, and Harry tossed another\nto Professor Quirrell. The two older men each muttered identical\ncharms over the can and frowned briefly at the result. Harry, for\nhis part, simply popped the top and drank.",
      "The Defense Professor and the Headmaster of Hogwarts politely\nfollowed suit.",
      "Harry said, \"I thought of my absolute rejection of death as the\nnatural order.\"",
      "It might not be the right kind of warm feeling you needed to\ncast a Patronus Charm, but it was going into Harry's Top 10\nnonetheless.",
      "The looks he got from the Defense Professor and the Headmaster\nbriefly made Harry nervous, as the spilled Comed-Tea faded out of\nexistence; but then the two of them each glanced at the other and\nboth apparently decided that they couldn't get away with doing\nanything really awful to Harry in the other's presence.",
      "\"Mr. Potter,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"even I know\nthat is not how things are supposed to work.\"",
      "\"Indeed,\" said Dumbledore. \"Explain.\"",
      "Harry opened his mouth, and then, as realization hit him,\nrapidly snapped his mouth shut again. Godric hadn't told anyone,\nnor had Rowena if she'd known; there might have been any number of\nwizards who'd figured it out and kept their mouths shut. You\ncouldn't forget if you knew that was what you were trying\nto do; once you realized how it worked, the animal form of\nthe Patronus Charm would never work for you again - and most\nwizards didn't have the right upbringing to turn on Dementors and\ndestroy them -",
      "\"Erm, sorry about this,\" said Harry. \"But I've just this instant\nrealized that explaining would be an incredibly bad idea\nuntil you work some things out on your own.\"",
      "\"Is that the truth, Harry?\" Dumbledore said slowly. \"Or are you\njust pretending to be wise -\"",
      "\"Headmaster!\u202f\" said Professor Quirrell, sounding\ngenuinely shocked. \"Mr. Potter has told you that this spell is not\nspoken of with those who cannot cast it! You do not press a wizard\non such matters!\"",
      "\"If I told you -\" Harry began.",
      "\"No,\" Professor Quirrell said, sounding rather severe. \"You\ndon't tell us why, Mr. Potter, you simply tell us that we\nare not to know. If you wish to devise a hint, you do so carefully,\nat leisure, not in the midst of conversation.\"",
      "Harry nodded.",
      "\"But,\" said the Headmaster. \"But, but what am I to tell the\nMinistry? You can't just lose a Dementor!\"",
      "\"Tell them I ate it,\" said Professor Quirrell, causing Harry to\nchoke on the soda he had unthinkingly raised to his lips. \"I don't\nmind. Shall we head on back, Mr. Potter?\"",
      "The two of them began to walk the dirt path back to Hogwarts,\nleaving behind Albus Dumbledore staring forlornly at the empty cage\nand the three sleeping Aurors awaiting their Memory Charms.",
      "Aftermath, Harry Potter and Professor Quirrell:",
      "They walked for a while before Professor Quirrell spoke, and all\nbackground noise dropped into silence when he did.",
      "\"You are exceptionally good at killing things, my student,\" said\nProfessor Quirrell.",
      "\"Thank you,\" Harry said sincerely.",
      "\"I am not prying,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"but on the\noff-chance that it was only the Headmaster who you did not\ntrust with the secret...?\"",
      "Harry considered this. Professor Quirrell already couldn't cast\nthe animal Patronus Charm.",
      "But you couldn't untell a secret, and Harry was a fast enough\nlearner to realize that he ought to at least think for a\nwhile before unleashing this one upon the world.",
      "Harry shook his head, and Professor Quirrell nodded\nacceptance.",
      "\"Out of curiosity, Professor Quirrell,\" said Harry, \"if your\nbringing the Dementor to Hogwarts had been part of an evil plot,\nwhat would have been its goal?\"",
      "\"Assassinate Dumbledore while he was weakened,\" Professor\nQuirrell said without even hesitating. \"Hm. The Headmaster told you\nhe was suspicious of me?\"",
      "Harry said nothing for a second while he tried to think of a\nreply, and then gave up when he realized he'd already answered.",
      "\"Interesting...\" Professor Quirrell said. \"Mr. Potter, it is not\nout of the question that there was a plot at work today.\nYour wand ending up that close to the Dementor's cage\ncould have been an accident. Or one of the Aurors could\nhave been Imperiused, Confunded, or Legilimized to exert an\ninfluence. Flitwick and myself should not be excluded as suspects,\nin your calculation. One notes that Professor Snape canceled all\nhis classes today, and I suspect he is powerful enough to\nDisillusion himself; the Aurors cast detection charms early on, but\nthey did not repeat them immediately before your turn. But most\neasily of all, Mr. Potter, the deed could have been plotted by\nDumbledore himself; and if he did, why, he might also take\nsteps in advance to cast your suspicion elsewhere.\"",
      "They walked on for a few steps.",
      "\"But why would he?\" Harry said.",
      "The Defense Professor stayed quiet a moment, and then said, \"Mr.\nPotter, what steps have you taken to investigate the Headmaster's\ncharacter?\"",
      "\"Not many,\" said Harry. He'd only recently realized... \"Not\nnearly enough.\"",
      "\"Then I will observe,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"that you do not\nfind out all there is to know about a man by asking only his\nfriends.\"",
      "Now it was Harry's turn to walk a few steps in silence on the\nslightly beaten dirt path that led back to Hogwarts. He'd really\nbeen supposed to know better than that already. Confirmation bias\nwas the technical term; it meant, among other things, that when you\nchose your information sources, there was a notable tendency to\nchoose information sources that agreed with your current\nopinions.",
      "\"Thank you,\" Harry said. \"Actually... I didn't say it earlier,\ndid I? Thank you for everything. If another Dementor ever\nthreatens you, or for that matter, slightly annoys you, just let me\nknow and I'll introduce it to Mister Glowy Person. I don't like it\nwhen Dementors slightly annoy my friends.\"",
      "That got him an indecipherable glance from Professor Quirrell.\n\"You destroyed the Dementor because it threatened me?\"",
      "\"Erm,\" Harry said, \"I'd sort of decided on it before then, but\nyes, that would have been sufficient reason by itself.\"",
      "\"I see,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"And what would you have done\nabout the threat to me if your spell hadn't worked for\ndestroying the Dementor?\"",
      "\"Plan B,\" said Harry. \"Encase the Dementor in dense metal with a\nhigh melting point, probably tungsten, drop it into an active\nvolcano, and hope it ends up inside Earth's mantle. Ah, the whole\nplanet is filled with molten lava under its surface -\"",
      "\"Yes,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"I know.\" The Defense Professor\nwas wearing a very odd smile. \"I really should have thought of that\nmyself, all things considered. Tell me, Mr. Potter, if you wanted\nto lose something where no one would ever find it again, where\nwould you put it?\"",
      "Harry considered this question. \"I suppose I shouldn't ask\nwhat you've found that needs losing -\"",
      "\"Quite,\" said Professor Quirrell, as Harry had expected; and\nthen, \"Perhaps you will be told when you are older,\" which Harry\nhadn't.",
      "\"Well,\" said Harry, \"besides trying to get it into the molten\ncore of the planet, you could bury it in solid rock a kilometer\nunderground in a randomly selected location - maybe teleport it in,\nif there's some way to do that blindly, or drill a hole and repair\nthe hole afterward; the important thing would be not to leave any\ntraces leading there, so it's just an anonymous cubic meter\nsomewhere in the Earth's crust. You could drop it into the Mariana\nTrench, that's the deepest depth of ocean on the planet - or just\npick some random other ocean trench, to make it less obvious. If\nyou could make it buoyant and invisible, then you could throw it\ninto the stratosphere. Or ideally you would launch it into space,\nwith a cloak against detection, and a randomly fluctuating\nacceleration factor that would take it out of the Solar System. And\nafterward, of course, you'd Obliviate yourself, so even you didn't\nknow exactly where it was.\"",
      "The Defense Professor was laughing, and it sounded even odder\nthan his smile.",
      "\"Professor Quirrell?\" Harry said.",
      "\"All excellent suggestions,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"But tell\nme, Mr. Potter, why those exact five?\"",
      "\"Huh?\" said Harry. \"They just seemed like the obvious sorts of\nideas.\"",
      "\"Oh?\" said Professor Quirrell. \"But there is an interesting\npattern to them, you see. One might say it sounds like something of\na riddle. I must admit, Mr. Potter, that although it has had its\nups and downs, on the whole, this has been a surprisingly good\nday.\"",
      "And they continued walking down the path that led to the gates\nof Hogwarts, quite some distance apart; as Harry, without even\nthinking about it, automatically stayed far enough away from the\nDefense Professor not to trigger that sense of doom, which for some\nreason seemed unusually strong right now.",
      "Aftermath, Daphne Greengrass:",
      "Hermione had refused to answer any questions, and as soon as\nthey'd passed the split leading to the Slytherin dungeons, Daphne\nand Tracey had peeled off at once, walking as quickly as they\ncould. Rumor traveled fast in Hogwarts, so they'd have to go to the\ndungeons right away if they wanted to be the first to tell everyone\nthe story.",
      "\"Now remember,\" said Daphne, \"don't just blurt out about the\nkiss as soon as we walk in, okay? It works better if we tell the\nwhole story in order.\"",
      "Tracey nodded excitedly.",
      "And as soon as they burst into the Slytherin common room, Tracey\nDavis took a deep breath and shouted, \"Everyone! Harry Potter\ncouldn't cast the Patronus Charm and the Dementor almost ate him\nand Professor Quirrell saved him but then Potter was all evil until\nGranger brought him back with a kiss! It's true love for\nsure!\u202f\"",
      "It was ordered storytelling of a sort, Daphne supposed.",
      "The news failed to produce the expected reaction. Most of the\ngirls glanced over and then stayed in their couches, or the boys\nsimply kept reading in their chairs.",
      "\"Yes,\" said Pansy sourly, from where she was sitting with\nGregory's feet in her lap, leaning back and reading what seemed to\nbe a coloring book, \"Millicent already told us.\"",
      "How -",
      "\"Why didn't you kiss him first, Tracey?\" said Flora and\nHestia Carrow from their own chairs. \"Now Potter's going to marry a\nmudblood girl! You could've been his true love and gotten\ninto a rich Noble House and everything if you'd just kissed him\nfirst!\"",
      "Tracey's face was a picture in stunned realization.",
      "\"What?\u202f\" shrieked Daphne. \"Love does not work like\nthat!\"",
      "\"Of course it does,\" stated Millicent from where she was\npracticing some sort of Charm while looking out a window at the\nswirling waters of the Hogwarts Lake. \"First kiss gets the\nprince.\"",
      "\"It wasn't their first kiss!\u202f\" shouted Daphne.\n\"Hermione was already his true love! That's why\nshe could bring him back!\" Then Daphne realized what she'd\njust said and winced internally, but as the saying went, you had to\nfit the tongue to the ear.",
      "\"Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?\" said Gregory, swinging his feet off\nPansy's lap. \"What's this? Miss Bulstrode didn't tell that\npart.\"",
      "Everyone else was also looking at Daphne, now.",
      "\"Oh, yeah,\" said Daphne, \"Harry shoved her away and shouted, 'I\ntold you, no kissing!' Then Harry screamed like he was dying and\nFawkes started singing to him - I'm not sure which one of those\nhappened first, actually -\"",
      "\"That doesn't sound like true love to me,\" said the\nCarrow twins. \"That sounds like the wrong person kissed\nhim.\"",
      "\"It was supposed to be me,\" whispered Tracey. Her face\nwas still stunned. \"I was supposed to be his true love.\nHarry Potter was my general. I should've, I should've\nfought Granger for him -\"",
      "Daphne spun on Tracey, incensed. \"You? Take Harry away\nfrom Hermione?\"",
      "\"Yeah!\" said Tracey. \"Me!\"",
      "\"You're nuts,\" Daphne stated with conviction. \"Even if you\nhad kissed him first, you know what that would make you?\nThe sad little lovestruck girl who dies at the end of Act Two.\"",
      "\"You take that back!\u202f\" shouted Tracey.",
      "Meanwhile, Gregory had crossed the room to where Vincent was\ndoing his homework. \"Mr. Crabbe,\" Gregory said in a low voice, \"I\nthink Mr. Malfoy needs to know about this.\"",
      "Aftermath, Hermione Granger:",
      "Hermione stared at the wax-sealed paper, on the surface of which\nwas inscribed simply the number 42.",
      "I figured out why we couldn't cast the Patronus Charm,\nHermione, it doesn't have anything to do with us not being happy\nenough. But I can't tell you. I couldn't even tell the Headmaster.\nIt needs to be even more secret than partial Transfiguration, for\nnow, anyway. But if you ever need to fight Dementors, the secret is\nwritten here, cryptically, so that if someone doesn't know it's\nabout Dementors and the Patronus Charm, they won't know what it\nmeans...",
      "She'd told Harry about seeing him dying, her parents dying, all\nher friends dying, everyone dying. She hadn't told him about her\nterror of dying alone, somehow that was still too painful.",
      "Harry had told her about remembering his parents dying, and that\nhe'd thought it was funny.",
      "There's no light in the place the Dementor takes you,\nHermione. No warmth. No caring. It's somewhere that you can't even\nunderstand happiness. There's pain, and fear, and those can still\ndrive you. You can hate, and take pleasure in destroying what you\nhate. You can laugh, when you see other people hurting. But you\ncan't ever be happy, you can't even remember what it is that isn't\nthere anymore... I don't think there's any way I can ever explain\njust what you saved me from. I'm usually ashamed to put people to\ntrouble, I usually can't stand it when people make sacrifices for\nme, but this one time I'll say that no matter what it ends up\ncosting you to have kissed me, don't ever doubt for a second that\nit was the right thing to do.",
      "Hermione hadn't realized how little the Dementor had\ntouched her, how small and shallow had been the darkness into which\nit had taken her.",
      "She'd seen everyone dying, and that had still been able to\nhurt.",
      "Hermione put the paper back into her pouch, like a good girl\nought to.",
      "She'd really wanted to read it, though.",
      "She was frightened of Dementors.",
      "Aftermath, Minerva McGonagall:",
      "She felt frozen; she shouldn't have been so shocked, she\nshouldn't have found Harry so hard to face, but after what he'd\nbeen through... She had searched the young boy in front of her for\nany signs of Dementation, and failed to find them. But something\nabout the calm with which he had asked such a foreboding question\nseemed deeply worrying. \"Mr. Potter, I can't possibly speak of such\nmatters without the Headmaster's permission!\"",
      "The boy in her office took this in without changing expression.\n\"I would prefer not to disturb the Headmaster over this matter,\"\nHarry Potter said calmly. \"I insist on not disturbing him,\nin fact, and you did promise that our conversation would be kept\nprivate. So let me put it this way. I know that there was, in fact,\na prophecy. I know that you are the one who originally heard it\nfrom Professor Trelawney. I know that the prophecy identified the\nchild of James and Lily as someone dangerous to the Dark Lord. And\nI know who I am, indeed everyone now knows who I am, so you are\nrevealing nothing new or dangerous, if you tell me only this: What\nwas the exact wording which identified me, the\nchild of James and Lily?\"",
      "Trelawney's hollow voice echoed in her mind -",
      "BORN TO THOSE WHO HAVE THRICE DEFIED HIM,\nBORN AS THE SEVENTH MONTH DIES...",
      "\"Harry,\" said Professor McGonagall, \"I can't possibly tell you\nthat!\" It chilled her to the bone that Harry knew so much already,\nshe couldn't imagine how Harry had learned -",
      "The boy looked at her with strange, sorrowful eyes. \"Can you not\nsneeze without the Headmaster's permission, Professor McGonagall?\nFor I do promise to you that I have good reason to ask, and good\nreason to keep the question private.\"",
      "\"Please don't, Harry,\" she whispered.",
      "\"All right,\" Harry said. \"One simple question. Please. Was the\nPotter family mentioned by name? Does the prophecy\nliterally say 'Potter'?\"",
      "She stared at Harry for a while. She couldn't have said why or\nwhere she got the sense that this was a critical point, that she\ncould not lightly refuse the request, nor lightly accede to it\n-",
      "\"No,\" she finally said. \"Please, Harry, don't ask any more.\"",
      "The boy smiled, a little sadly it seemed, and said, \"Thank you,\nMinerva. You are a good woman and true.\"",
      "And while her mouth was still open in utter shock, Harry Potter\ngot up and left the office; and only then did she realize that\nHarry had taken her refusal as an answer, and the true answer at\nthat -",
      "Harry closed the door behind himself.",
      "The logic had presented itself with a strange diamondlike\nclarity. Harry couldn't have said if it had come to him during\nFawkes's singing, or maybe even before.",
      "Lord Voldemort had killed James Potter. He had preferred to\nspare Lily Potter's life. He had continued his attack, therefore,\nwith the sole purpose of killing their infant child.",
      "Dark Lords were not usually scared of infant children.",
      "So there was a prophecy about Harry Potter being dangerous to\nLord Voldemort, and Lord Voldemort had known that prophecy.",
      "\"I give you this rare chance to flee. But I will not trouble\nmyself to subdue you, and your death here will not save your child.\nStep aside, foolish woman, if you have any sense in you at\nall!\"",
      "Had it been a whim, to give her that chance? But then Lord\nVoldemort would not have tried to persuade her. Had the prophecy\nwarned Lord Voldemort against killing Lily Potter? Then Lord\nVoldemort would have troubled himself to subdue her. Lord\nVoldemort had been mildly inclined not to kill Lily\nPotter. The preference had been stronger than a whim, but not as\nstrong as a warning.",
      "So suppose that someone whom Lord Voldemort considered a lesser\nally or servant, useful but not indispensable, had begged the Dark\nLord to spare Lily's life. Lily's, but not James's.",
      "This person had known that Lord Voldemort would attack the house\nof the Potters. Had known both the prophecy, and the fact that the\nDark Lord knew it. Otherwise he would not have begged Lily's\nlife.",
      "According to Professor McGonagall, besides herself, the other\ntwo who knew of the prophecy were Albus Dumbledore and Severus\nSnape.",
      "Severus Snape, who had loved Lily before she was Lily Potter,\nand hated James.",
      "Severus, then, had learned of the prophecy, and told it to the\nDark Lord. Which he had done because the prophecy had not described\nthe Potters by name. It had been a riddle, and Severus had solved\nthat riddle only too late.",
      "But if Severus had been the first to hear the prophecy,\nand disposed to tell it to the Dark Lord, then why would he also\nhave told Dumbledore or Professor McGonagall?",
      "Therefore Dumbledore or Professor McGonagall had heard it\nfirst.",
      "The Headmaster of Hogwarts had no obvious reason to tell the\nTransfiguration Professor about an extremely sensitive and crucial\nprophecy. But the Transfiguration Professor had every reason to\ntell the Headmaster.",
      "It seemed likely, then, that Professor McGonagall had been the\nfirst to hear it.",
      "The prior probabilities said that it had been Professor\nTrelawney, Hogwarts's resident seer. Seers were rare, so if you\ncounted up most of the seconds Professor McGonagall had spent in\nthe presence of a seer over the course of her lifetime, most of\nthose seer-seconds would be Trelawney-seconds.",
      "Professor McGonagall had told Dumbledore, and would have told no\none else about the prophecy without permission.",
      "Therefore, it was Albus Dumbledore who had arranged for Severus\nSnape to somehow learn of the prophecy. And Dumbledore himself had\nsolved the riddle successfully, or he would not have selected\nSeverus, who had once loved Lily, as the intermediary.",
      "Dumbledore had deliberately arranged for Lord Voldemort to hear\nabout the prophecy, in hopes of luring him to his death. Perhaps\nDumbledore had arranged for Severus to learn only some of\nthe prophecy, or there were other prophecies of which Severus had\nremained innocent... somehow Dumbledore had known that an\nimmediate attack on the Potters would still lead to Lord\nVoldemort's immediate defeat, although Lord Voldemort\nhimself had not believed this. Or maybe that had just been a lucky\nstroke of Dumbledore's insanity, his taste for bizarre plots...",
      "Severus had ended up serving Dumbledore afterward; perhaps the\nDeath Eaters would not look kindly on Severus if Dumbledore\nrevealed his role in their defeat.",
      "Dumbledore had tried to arrange for Harry's mother to be spared.\nBut that part of his plot had failed. And he had knowingly\ncondemned James Potter to his death.",
      "Dumbledore was responsible for the deaths of Harry's parents.\nIf the whole chain of logic was correct. Harry could not,\nin justice, say that successfully ending the Wizarding War did not\ncount as extenuating circumstances. But somehow this still...\nbothered him a great deal.",
      "And it was time and past time to ask Draco Malfoy what the\nother side of that war had to say about the character of\nAlbus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore."

      "There comes a point in every plot where the victim starts to\nsuspect; and looks back, and sees a trail of events all pointing in\na single direction. And when that point comes, Father had\nexplained, the prospect of the loss may seem so unbearable, and\nadmitting themselves tricked may seem so humiliating, that the\nvictim will yet deny the plot, and the game may continue long\nafter.",
      "Father had warned Draco not to do that again.",
      "First, though, he'd let Mr. Avery finish eating all of the\ncookies he'd swindled from Draco, while Draco watched and cried.\nThe whole lovely jar of cookies that Father had given him just a\nfew hours earlier, for Draco had lost all of them to Mr. Avery,\ndown to the very last one.",
      "So it was a familiar feeling that Draco had felt in the pit of\nhis stomach, when Gregory told him about The Kiss.",
      "Sometimes you looked back, and saw things...",
      "(In a lightless classroom - you couldn't quite call it\nunused any more, since it'd seen weekly use over the last\nfew months - a boy sat enshrouded in a hooded cowl, with an\nunlighted crystal globe on the desk in front of him. Thinking in\nsilence, thinking in darkness, waiting for an opening door to let\nin the light.)",
      "Harry had shoved Granger away and said, I told you, no\nkissing!",
      "Harry would probably say something like, She just did it to\nannoy me, last time, just like she made me go on that\ndate.",
      "But the verified story was that Granger had been willing to face\nthe Dementor again in order to help Harry; that she had kissed\nHarry, crying, when he was lost in the depths of Dementation; and\nthat her kiss had brought him back.",
      "That didn't sound like rivalry, even friendly rivalry.",
      "That sounded like the kind of friendship you usually didn't see\neven in plays.",
      "Then why had Harry made his friend climb the icy walls of\nHogwarts?",
      "Because that was the sort of thing Harry Potter did to his\nfriends?",
      "Father had told Draco that to fathom a strange plot, one\ntechnique was to look at what ended up happening, assume\nit was the intended result, and ask who benefited.",
      "What had ended up happening as the result of Draco and Granger\nfighting Harry Potter together... was that Draco had started to\nfeel a lot friendlier toward Granger.",
      "Who benefited from the scion of Malfoy becoming friends with a\nmudblood witch?",
      "Who benefited, that was famous for exactly that sort of\nplot?",
      "Who benefited, that could possibly be pulling Harry Potter's\nstrings?",
      "Dumbledore.",
      "And if that was true then Draco would have to go to\nFather and tell him everything, no matter what happened after that,\nDraco couldn't imagine what would happen after that, it was awful\nbeyond imagining. Which made him want to cling desperately to the\nlast shred of hope that it wasn't all what it looked like...",
      "...Draco remembered that, too, from Mr. Avery's lesson.",
      "Draco hadn't planned to confront Harry yet. He was still trying\nto think of an experimental test, something that Harry wouldn't\njust see through and fake. But then Vincent had come with the\nmessage that Harry wanted to meet early this week, on Friday\ninstead of Saturday.",
      "And so here Draco was, in a dark classroom, an unlit crystal\nglobe on his desk, waiting.",
      "Minutes passed.",
      "Footsteps approached.",
      "The door made a gentle creak as it swung open into the\nclassroom, revealing Harry Potter dressed in his own hood and cowl;\nHarry stepped forward into the dark classroom, and the sturdy door\nclosed behind him with a faint click.",
      "Draco tapped the crystal globe, and the classroom lit with\nbright green light. Green light projected shadows of the desks onto\nthe floor, and glared back at him from the curved chair-backs,\nphotons bouncing off the wood in such fashion that the angle of\nincidence equaled the angle of reflection.",
      "At least that much of what he'd learned wasn't likely\nto be a lie.",
      "Harry had flinched as the light went on, halting for a moment,\nthen resumed his approach. \"Hello, Draco,\" Harry said quietly,\ndrawing back his hood as he came to Draco's desk. \"Thank you for\ncoming, I know it's not our usual time -\"",
      "\"You're welcome,\" Draco said flatly.",
      "Harry dragged one of the chairs to face Draco across his desk,\nthe legs making a slight screeching sound on the floor. He spun the\nchair so that it was facing the wrong way, and sat down straddling\nit, his arms folded across the back of the chair. The boy's face\nwas pensive, frowning, serious, looking very adult even for Harry\nPotter.",
      "\"I have an important question to ask you,\" said Harry, \"but\nthere's something else I want us to do before that.\"",
      "Draco said nothing, feeling a certain weariness. Part of him\njust wanted it all to be over with already.",
      "\"Tell me, Draco,\" said Harry. \"Why don't Muggles ever leave\nghosts behind when they die?\"",
      "\"Because Muggles don't have souls, obviously,\" Draco said. He\ndidn't even realize until after he'd said it that it might\ncontradict Harry's politics, and then he didn't care. Besides, it\nwas obvious.",
      "Harry's face showed no surprise. \"Before I ask my important\nquestion, I want to see if you can learn the Patronus Charm.\"",
      "For a moment the sheer nonsequitur stumped Draco. Good old\nimpossible-to-predict-or-understand Harry Potter. There were times\nwhen Draco wondered whether Harry was deliberately this\ndisorienting as a tactic.",
      "Then Draco understood, and shoved himself up and away from his\ndesk in a single angry motion. That was it. It was over. \"Like\nDumbledore's servants,\" he spat.",
      "\"Like Salazar Slytherin,\" Harry said steadily.",
      "Draco almost stumbled over his own feet in the middle of his\nfirst stride toward the door.",
      "Slowly, Draco turned back toward Harry.",
      "\"I don't know where you came up with that,\" said Draco, \"but\nit's wrong, everyone knows the Patronus Charm is a Gryffindor spell\n-\"",
      "\"Salazar Slytherin could cast a corporeal Patronus Charm,\" Harry\nsaid. Harry's hand darted into his robes, brought out a book whose\ntitle was written as white on green, and so almost impossible to\nread in the green light; but it looked old. \"I discovered that when\nI was researching the Patronus Charm before. And I found the\noriginal reference and checked the book out of the library just in\ncase you didn't believe me. The author of this book doesn't think\nthere's anything unusual about Salazar being able to cast\na Patronus, either; the belief that Slytherins can't do that must\nbe recent. And as a further historical note, though I don't have\nthe book with me, Godric Gryffindor never could.\"",
      "After the first six times Draco had tried calling Harry's bluff,\non six successively more ridiculous occasions, he'd realized that\nHarry just didn't lie about what was written in books.\nStill, when Harry's hands opened the book and laid it out to the\nplace of a bookmark, Draco leaned over and studied the place where\nHarry's finger pointed.",
      "Then the fires of Ravenclaw fell upon the darkness that had\ncloaked the left wing of Lord Foul's army, breaking it, and it was\nrevealed that the Lord Gryffindor had spoken true; the fear they\nall had felt was not natural in its source, but coming from thrice\na dozen Dementors, who had been promised the souls of the defeated.\nAt once the Lady Hufflepuff and Lord Slytherin brought forth their\nPatronuses, a vast angry badger and a bright silver serpent, and\nthe defenders lifted their heads as the shadow passed from their\nhearts. And Lady Ravenclaw laughed, remarking that Lord Foul was a\ngreat fool, for now his own army would be subject to the fear, but\nnot the defenders of Hogwarts. Yet the Lord Slytherin said, \"No\nfool he, that much I know.\" And the Lord Gryffindor beside him\nstudied the battlefield with a frown upon his face...",
      "Draco looked back up. \"So?\"",
      "Harry closed the book and put it into his pouch. \"Chaos and\nSunshine both have soldiers that can cast corporeal Patronus\nCharms. Corporeal Patronuses can be used to convey messages. If you\ncan't learn the spell, Dragon Army will be at a severe military\ndisadvantage -\"",
      "Draco didn't care about that right now, and told Harry so. His\nvoice was sharper than it probably should have been.",
      "Harry didn't blink. \"Then I'm calling in the favor you owe me\nfrom that time I stopped a riot from breaking out, on our first day\nof broomstick lessons. I'm going to try to teach you the Patronus\nCharm, and for my favor, I want you to do your honest best to learn\nand cast it. I trust to the honor of House Malfoy that you\nwill.\"",
      "Draco felt that certain weariness again. If Harry had asked at\nany other time, it would have been a fair return on favor owed,\ngiven that it wasn't actually a Gryffindor spell. But...",
      "\"Why?\u202f\" Draco said.",
      "\"To find out whether you can do this thing that Salazar\nSlytherin could do,\" Harry said evenly. \"This is an experimental\ntest, and I will not tell you what it means until after you have\ndone it. Will you?\"",
      "...It probably was a good idea to discharge that favor\non something innocuous, all the more so if it was time to break\nwith Harry Potter. \"All right.\"",
      "Harry drew a wand from his robes, and laid it against the globe.\n\"Not really the best color for learning the Patronus Charm,\" Harry\nsaid. \"Green light the exact shade of the Killing Curse, I mean.\nBut silver is a Slytherin color too, isn't it? Dulak.\" The\nlight went out, and Harry whispered the first two phrases of the\nContinual Light enchantment, recasting that part of it, though\nneither of them could have cast the whole thing by themselves. Then\nHarry tapped the globe again, and the room lit with a silver\nradiance, brilliant but still soft and gentle. Color returned to\nthe desks and chairs, and to Harry's slightly sweaty face beneath\nhis shock of black hair.",
      "It took that long for Draco to realize the implication. \"You saw\na Killing Curse cast since the last time we met? When -\nhow -\"",
      "\"Cast the Patronus Charm,\" Harry said, looking more serious than\never, \"and I'll tell you.\"",
      "Draco pressed his hands to his eyes, shutting out the silver\nlight. \"You know, I really should remember that you're too\nweird for any normal plots!\"",
      "Within his self-imposed darkness, he heard the sound of Harry\nsnickering.",
      "Harry watched closely as Draco finished his latest run-through\nof the preliminary gestures, the part of the spell that was\ndifficult to learn; the final brandish and the pronunciation didn't\nhave to be precise. All three of the last runs had been perfect as\nfar as Harry could see. Harry had also felt an odd impulse to\nadjust things that Mr. Lupin hadn't said anything about, like the\nangle of Draco's elbow or the direction his foot was pointing; it\ncould have been entirely his own imagination, and probably was, but\nHarry had decided to go with it just in case.",
      "\"All right,\" Harry said quietly. There was a tension in his\nchest that made it a little hard to speak. \"Now we don't have a\nDementor here, but that's all right. We won't need one. Draco, when\nyour father spoke to me at the train station, he said that you were\nthe one thing in the world that was most precious to him, and he\nthreatened to throw away all his other plans to take vengeance on\nme, if ever you came to harm.\"",
      "\"He... what?\" There was a catch in Draco's voice, and a strange\nlook on his face. \"Why are you telling me that?\u202f\"",
      "\"Why wouldn't I?\" Harry didn't let his expression change, though\nhe could guess what Draco was thinking; that Harry had been\nplotting to separate Draco from his father, and shouldn't be saying\nanything that would bring them closer together. \"There's always\nbeen just one person who matters most to you, and I know exactly\nwhat warm and happy thought will let you cast the Patronus Charm.\nYou told it to me at the train station before the first day of\nschool. Once you fell off a broomstick and broke your ribs. It hurt\nmore than anything you'd ever felt, and you thought you were going\nto die. Pretend that fear is coming from a Dementor, standing in\nfront of you, wearing a tattered black cloak, looking like a dead\nthing left in water. And then cast the Patronus Charm, and when you\nbrandish the wand to drive the Dementor away, think of how your\nfather held your hand, so that you wouldn't be afraid; and then\nthink of how much he loves you, and how much you love him, and put\nit all into your voice when you say Expecto Patronum. For\nthe honor of House Malfoy, and not just because you promised me a\nfavor. Show me you didn't lie to me that day in the train station\nwhen you told me Lucius was a good father. Show me you can do what\nSalazar Slytherin could do.\"",
      "And Harry stepped backward, behind Draco, out of Draco's field\nof vision, so that Draco only faced the dusty old teacher's desk\nand blackboard at the front of the unused classroom.",
      "Draco cast one look behind him, that strange look still on his\nface, and then turned away to face forward. Harry saw the\nexhalation, the inhalation. The wand twitched once, twice, thrice,\nand four times. Draco's fingers slid along the wand, exactly the\nright distances -",
      "Draco lowered his wand.",
      "\"This is too -\" Draco said, \"I can't think this right,\nwhile you're watching -\"",
      "Harry turned around and started walking toward the door. \"I'll\ncome back in a minute,\" Harry said. \"Just hold to your happy\nthought, and the Patronus will stay.\"",
      "From behind Draco came the sound of the door opening again.",
      "Draco heard Harry's footsteps entering the classroom, but Draco\ndidn't turn to look.",
      "Harry didn't say anything either. The silence stretched.",
      "Finally -",
      "\"What does this mean?\u202f\" Draco said. His voice wavered a\nbit.",
      "\"It means you love your father,\" Harry's voice said. Which was\njust what Draco had been thinking, and trying not to cry in front\nof Harry. It was too right, just too right -",
      "Before Draco, on the floor, was the shining form of a snake that\nDraco recognized; a Blue Krait, a snake first brought to their\nmanor by Lord Abraxas Malfoy after a visit to some faraway land,\nand Father had kept a Blue Krait in the ophidiarium ever since. The\nthing about the Blue Krait was that the bite wouldn't hurt much.\nFather had said that, and told Draco that he was never\nallowed to pet the snake, no matter who was watching. The venom\nkilled your nerves so fast that you didn't have time to feel pain\nas the poison spread. You could die of it even after using Healing\nCharms. It ate other snakes. It was as Slytherin as any creature\ncould possibly be.",
      "That was why a Blue Krait head had been forged into the handle\nof Father's cane.",
      "The bright snake darted out its tongue, which was also silver;\nand seemed to smile somehow, in a warmer way than any\nreptile should.",
      "And then Draco realized -",
      "\"But,\" Draco said, still staring at the beautifully radiant\nsnake, \"you can't cast the Patronus Charm.\" Now that Draco\nhad cast it himself, he understood why that was important. You\ncould be evil, like Dumbledore, and still cast the Patronus Charm,\nso long as you had something bright left inside you. But\nif Harry Potter didn't have a single thought inside him that shone\nlike that -",
      "\"The Patronus Charm is more complicated than you think, Draco,\"\nHarry said seriously. \"Not everyone who fails at casting it is a\nbad person, or even unhappy. But anyway, I can cast it. I\ndid it on my second try, after I realized what I'd done wrong\nfacing the Dementor my first time. But, well, my life gets a little\npeculiar sometimes, and my Patronus came out strange, and I'm\nkeeping it a secret for now -\"",
      "\"Am I supposed to just believe that?\"",
      "\"You can ask Professor Quirrell if you don't believe me,\" said\nHarry. \"Ask him whether Harry Potter can cast a corporeal Patronus,\nand tell him that I told you to ask. He'd know the request was from\nme, no one else would know.\"",
      "Oh, and now Draco was to trust Professor Quirrell?\nStill, knowing Harry, it might be true; and Professor Quirrell\nwouldn't lie for trivial reasons.",
      "The glowing snake turned its head back and forth, as though\nseeking a prey that wasn't there, and then coiled itself into a\ncircle, as though to rest.",
      "\"I wonder,\" Harry said softly, \"when it was, which year, which\ngeneration, that Slytherins stopped trying to learn the Patronus\nCharm. When it was that people started to think, that Slytherins\nthemselves started to think, that being cunning and ambitious was\nthe same as being cold and unhappy. And if Salazar knew that his\nstudents didn't even bother showing up to learn the Patronus Charm\nany more, I wonder, would he wish that he'd never been born? I\nwonder how it all went wrong, when Slytherin's House went\nwrong.\"",
      "The shining creature winked out, the turmoil rising in Draco\nmaking it impossible to sustain the Charm. Draco spun on Harry, he\nhad to control himself not to raise his wand. \"What do you\nknow about Slytherin House or Salazar Slytherin?\nYou were never Sorted into my House, what gives you the\nright to -\"",
      "And that was when Draco finally realized.",
      "\"You did get Sorted into Slytherin!\u202f\" Draco said. \"You\ndid, and afterwards you, you somehow, you snapped your\nfingers -\" Draco had once asked Father if it would be cleverer\nto get Sorted into some other House so that everyone would trust\nhim, and Father had smiled and said that he'd thought of that too\nat Draco's age, but there was no way to fool the Sorting Hat...",
      "...not until Harry Potter came along.",
      "How had he ever bought for one minute that\nHarry was a Ravenclaw?",
      "\"An interesting hypothesis,\" Harry said equably. \"Do you know,\nyou're the second person in Hogwarts to come up with a theory along\nthose lines? At least you're the second that's actually said so to\nmy face -\"",
      "\"Snape,\" Draco said with certainty. His Head of House was no\nfool.",
      "\"Professor Quirrell, of course,\" said Harry. \"Though\ncome to think, Severus did ask me how I managed to stay out of his\nHouse, and whether I had something the Sorting Hat wanted. I\nsuppose you could say you're number three. Oh, but Professor\nQuirrell's theory was a little different than yours, though. May I\nhave your word not to repeat it?\"",
      "Draco nodded without even really thinking about it. What was he\nsupposed to do, say no?",
      "\"Professor Quirrell thought that Dumbledore wasn't happy with\nthe Hat's choice for the Boy-Who-Lived.\"",
      "And the instant Harry said it, Draco knew, he knew that\nit was true, it was just obvious. Who did Dumbledore even\nthink he was fooling?",
      "...well, besides every single other person in Hogwarts except\nSnape and Quirrell, Harry might even believe it\nhimself...",
      "Draco stumbled back over to his desk in something of a daze, and\nsat down hard enough to hurt slightly. This sort of thing happened\naround once a month with Harry, and it hadn't happened yet in\nJanuary, so it was time.",
      "His fellow Slytherin, who might or might not think himself a\nRavenclaw, sat back down in the chair he'd used earlier, now\nsitting on it crosswise, and looking up intently at Draco.",
      "Draco didn't know what he should be doing now, whether\nhe should be trying to persuade the lost Slytherin boy that, no, he\nwasn't actually a Ravenclaw... or trying to figure out\nwhether Harry was in league with Dumbledore, though that suddenly\nseemed less likely... but then why had Harry set up the\nwhole thing with him and Granger...",
      "He really should have remembered that Harry was too\nweird for any normal plots.",
      "\"Harry,\" Draco said. \"Did you deliberately antagonize me and\nGeneral Sunshine just so we'd work together against you?\"",
      "Harry nodded without hesitation, as though it was the most\nnormal thing in the world, and nothing to be ashamed of.",
      "\"The whole thing with the gloves and making us climb up the\nwalls of Hogwarts, the only point was to make me and\nGranger more friendly toward each other. And even before then.\nYou've been plotting it for a really long time. Since the\nbeginning.\"",
      "Again the nod.",
      "\"WHYYYYY?\u202f\"",
      "Harry's eyebrows lifted for a moment, the only reaction he\nshowed to Draco shrieking so loudly in the closed classroom that it\nhurt his own ears. WHY, WHY, WHY did Harry Potter DO this\nsort of thing...",
      "Then Harry said, \"So that Slytherins will be able to cast the\nPatronus Charm again.\"",
      "\"That... doesn't... make... SENSE!\u202f\" Draco was aware\nthat he was losing control of his voice, but he didn't seem able to\nstop himself. \"What does that have to do with\nGranger?\u202f\"",
      "\"Patterns,\" Harry said. His face was very serious now, and very\ngrave. \"Like a quarter of children born to Squib couples being\nwizards. A simple, unmistakable pattern you would recognize\ninstantly, if you knew what you were looking at; even though, if\nyou didn't know, you wouldn't even realize it was a clue. The\npoison in Slytherin House is something that's been seen before in\nthe Muggle world. This is an advance prediction, Draco, I\ncould have written it down for you before our first day of school,\njust from hearing you talk in King's Cross Station. Let me describe\nsome really pathetic sorts of people that hang around at your\nfather's political rallies, pureblood families that would never be\ninvited to dinner at Malfoy Manor. Bearing in mind that\nI've never met them, I'm just predicting it from\nrecognizing the pattern of what's happening to Slytherin House\n-\"",
      "And Harry Potter proceeded to describe the Parkinsons and\nMontagues and Boles with a calmly cutting accuracy that Draco\nwouldn't have dared think to himself in case there was a\nLegilimens around, it was beyond insult, they would\nkill Harry if they ever heard...",
      "\"To sum up,\" Harry finished, \"they don't have any power\nthemselves. They don't have any wealth themselves. If they didn't\nhave Muggleborns to hate, if all the Muggleborns vanished the way\nthey say they want, they'd wake up one morning and find\nthey had nothing. But so long as they can say purebloods\nare superior, they can feel superior themselves, they can feel like\npart of the master class. Even though your father would never dream\nof inviting them to dinner, even though there's not one Galleon in\ntheir vaults, even if they did worse on their OWLs than the worst\nMuggleborn in Hogwarts. Even if they can't cast the Patronus Charm\nany more. Everything is the Muggleborns' fault to them, they have\nsomeone besides themselves to blame for their own failures, and\nthat makes them even weaker. That's what Slytherin House is\nbecoming, pathetic, and the root of the problem is hating\nMuggleborns.\"",
      "\"Salazar Slytherin himself said that mudbloods needed to be cast\nout! That they were weakening our blood -\" Draco's voice had risen\nto a shout.",
      "\"Salazar was wrong as a question of simple fact! You\nknow that, Draco! And that hatred is poisoning\nyour whole House, you couldn't cast the Patronus Charm using a\nthought like that!\"",
      "\"Then why could Salazar Slytherin cast the Patronus\nCharm?\"",
      "Harry was wiping sweat from his forehead. \"Because things have\nchanged between then and now! Listen, Draco, three hundred\nyears ago you could find great scientists, as great as Salazar in\ntheir own way, who would have told you that some other Muggles were\ninferior because of their skin color -\"",
      "\"Skin color?\u202f\" said Draco.",
      "\"I know, skin color instead of anything important like blood\npurity, isn't it ridiculous? But then something in the world\nchanged, and now you can't find any great scientists who\nstill think skin color should matter, only loser people like the\nones I described to you. Salazar Slytherin made the mistake when\neveryone else was making it, because he grew up believing it, not\nbecause he was desperate for someone to hate. There were a\nfew people who did better than everyone else around them, and\nthey were exceptionally good. But the ones who just\naccepted what everyone else thought weren't exceptionally\nevil. The sad fact is that most people just don't notice a moral\nissue at all unless someone else is pointing it out to them; and\nonce they're as old as Salazar was when he met Godric, they've lost\nthe ability to change their minds. Only then Hogwarts was\nbuilt, and Hogwarts started sending acceptance letters to\nMuggleborns like Godric insisted, and more and more people began to\nnotice that Muggleborns weren't any different. Now it's a\nbig political issue instead of something that everyone just\nbelieves without thinking about it. And the correct answer\nis that Muggleborns aren't any weaker than purebloods. So\nnow the people who end up siding with what Salazar once\nbelieved, are either people who grew up in very closed pureblood\nenvironments like you, or people who are so pathetic\nthemselves that they're desperate for someone to feel superior to,\npeople who love to hate.\"",
      "\"That doesn't... that doesn't sound right...\" Draco's voice\nsaid. His ears listened, and wondered that he couldn't come up with\nanything better to say.",
      "\"It doesn't? Draco, you know now there's nothing wrong\nwith Hermione Granger. You had trouble dropping her off a roof, I\nhear. Even though you knew she'd taken a Feather-Falling Potion,\neven though you knew she was safe. What sort of person do you think\nwants to kill her, not for any wrong she did to them, just\nbecause she's a Muggleborn? Even though she's, she's just a young\ngirl who would help them with their homework in a second, if they\never asked her,\" Harry's voice broke, \"what sort of person wants\nher to die?\u202f\"",
      "Father -",
      "Draco felt split in two, he seemed to be having a problem with\ndual vision, Granger is a mudblood, she should die and a\ngirl hanging from his hand on the rooftop, like seeing double,\nseeing double -",
      "\"And anyone who doesn't want Hermione Granger to die,\nwon't want to hang around the sort of people who do!\nThat's all people think Slytherin is now, not clever\nplanning, not trying to achieve greatness, just hating Muggleborns!\nI paid Morag a Sickle to ask Padma why she hadn't gone to\nSlytherin, we both know she got the option. And Morag told me that\nPadma just gave her a look and said that she wasn't Pansy\nParkinson. You see? The best students with the virtues of\nmore than one House, the students with choices, they go\nunder the Hat thinking anywhere but Slytherin, and someone\nlike Padma ends up in Ravenclaw. And... I think the Sorting Hat\ntries to maintain a balance in the Sorting, so it fills out the\nranks of Slytherin with anyone who isn't repelled by all\nthe hatred. So instead of Padma Patil, Slytherin gets Pansy\nParkinson. She's not very cunning, and she's not very ambitious,\nbut she's the sort of person who doesn't mind what Slytherin is\nturning into. And the more Padmas go to Ravenclaw and the more\nPansies go to Slytherin, the more the process accelerates. It's\ndestroying Slytherin House, Draco!\u202f\"",
      "It had a ring of awful truth, Padma had belonged in\nSlytherin... and instead Slytherin got Pansy... Father rallied\nlesser families like the Parkinsons because they were convenient\nsources of support, but Father hadn't realized the\nconsequences of associating Slytherin's name with\nthem...",
      "\"I can't -\" Draco said, but he wasn't even sure what he couldn't\ndo - \"What do you want from me?\"",
      "\"I'm not sure how to heal Slytherin House,\" Harry said slowly.\n\"But I know it's something you and I will end up having to do. It\ntook centuries for science to dawn over the Muggle world, it only\nhappened slowly, but the stronger science got, the further that\nsort of hatred retreated.\" Harry's voice was quiet, now. \"I don't\nknow exactly why it worked that way, but that's how it happened\nhistorically. As though there's something in science like the shine\nof the Patronus Charm, driving back all sorts of darkness and\nmadness, not right away, but it seems to follow wherever science\ngoes. The Enlightenment, that was what it was called in the Muggle\nworld. It has something to do with seeking the truth, I think...\nwith being able to change your mind from what you grew up\nbelieving... with thinking logically, realizing that\nthere's no reason to hate someone because their skin is a\ndifferent color, just like there's no reason to hate Hermione\nGranger... or maybe there's something to it that even I don't\nunderstand. But the Enlightenment is something that you and I\nbelong to now, both of us. Fixing Slytherin House is just one of\nthe things we have to do.\"",
      "\"Let me think,\" Draco said, his voice coming out in something of\na croak, \"please,\" and he rested his head in his hands, and\nthought.",
      "Draco thought for a while, with his palms over his eyes to shut\nout the world, no sound but his and Harry's breathing. All the\npersuasive reasonableness of what Harry said, the evident grains of\ntruth that it contained; and against that, the obvious, the\nperfectly and entirely obvious hypothesis about what was\nreally going on...",
      "After a time, Draco finally raised his head.",
      "\"It sounds right,\" Draco said quietly.",
      "A huge smile broke out on Harry's face.",
      "\"So,\" Draco continued, \"is this where you bring me to\nDumbledore, to make it official?\"",
      "He kept his voice very casual as he said it.",
      "\"Oh, yeah,\" Harry said. \"That was the thing I was going to ask\nyou about, actually -\"",
      "Draco's blood froze in his veins, froze solid and shattered\n-",
      "\"Professor Quirrell said something to me that got me thinking,\nand, well, no matter how you answer this question, I'm already\nstupid for having not asked you a lot earlier. Everyone in\nGryffindor thinks Dumbledore is a saint, the Hufflepuffs think he's\ncrazy, the Ravenclaws are all proud of themselves for having worked\nout that he's only pretending to be crazy, but I never asked anyone\nin Slytherin. I'm supposed to know better than to make that sort of\nmistake. But if even you think Dumbledore's okay to\nconspire with on fixing Slytherin House, I guess I didn't miss\nanything important.\"",
      "...",
      "...",
      "...",
      "\"You know,\" Draco said, his voice remarkably calm, all things\nconsidered, \"every time I wonder if you do things like this just to\nannoy me, I tell myself that it has to be accidental,\nno one could possibly do this sort of thing on purpose\neven if they tried until blood trickled out of their ears. That's\nthe only reason I'm not going to strangle you now.\"",
      "\"Huh?\"",
      "And then strangle himself, because Harry had\ngrown up with Muggles, and then Dumbledore had smoothly diverted\nhim from Slytherin to Ravenclaw, so it was perfectly plausible that\nHarry might not know anything, and Draco had never thought\nto tell him.",
      "Or else Harry had guessed that Draco wouldn't join up with\nDumbledore so readily, and this itself was just the next step of\nDumbledore's plan...",
      "But if Harry really didn't know about Dumbledore, then\nwarning him had to take precedence over everything.",
      "\"All right,\" Draco said, after he'd had a chance to organize his\nthoughts. \"I don't know where to start, so I'll just start\nsomewhere.\" Draco drew a deep breath. This was going to take a\nwhile. \"Dumbledore murdered his little sister, and got away with it\nbecause his brother wouldn't testify against him -\"",
      "Harry listened with increasing worry and dismay. Harry had been\nprepared, he'd thought, to take the blood purist side of the story\nwith a grain of salt. The trouble was that even after you added an\nenormous amount of salt, it still didn't sound good.",
      "Dumbledore's father had been convicted of using Unforgivable\nCurses on children, and died in Azkaban. That was no sin of\nDumbledore's, but it would be a matter of public record. Harry\ncould check that part, and see whether all of this had been made up\nout of thin air by the blood purists.",
      "Dumbledore's mother had died mysteriously, shortly before his\nyounger sister died in what the Aurors had ruled to be murder.\nSupposedly that sister had been brutalized by Muggles and never\nspoken again after that; which, Draco pointed out, sounded\nremarkably like a botched Obliviation.",
      "After Harry's first few interruptions, Draco had seemed to pick\nup on the general principle, and was now presenting the\nobservations first and the inferences afterward.",
      "\"- so you don't have to take my word for it,\" said Draco, \"you\ncan see it, right? Anyone in Slytherin can. Dumbledore\nwaited to fight his duel with Grindelwald until the exact moment\nwhen it would look best for Dumbledore, after Grindelwald\nhad ruined most of Europe and built up a reputation as the most\nterrible Dark Wizard in history, and just when Grindelwald had lost\nthe gold and blood sacrifices he was getting from his Muggle pawns\nand was about to start heading downhill. If Dumbledore was really\nthe noble wizard he pretended to be, he'd have fought Grindelwald\nlong before that. Dumbledore probably wanted Europe\nruined, it was probably part of their plan together, he only\nattacked Grindelwald after his puppet failed him. And that\nbig flashy duel wasn't real, there's no way two wizards would be so\nexactly matched that they'd fight for twenty whole hours until one\nof them fell over from exhaustion, that was just Dumbledore making\nit look more spectacular.\" Here Draco's voice became more\nindignant. \"And that got Dumbledore made Chief Warlock of the\nWizengamot! The Line of Merlin Unbroken, corrupted after\nfifteen hundred years! And then he became Supreme Mugwump\non top of that, and he already had Hogwarts to use as an\ninvincible fortress - Headmaster and Chief Warlock\nand Supreme Mugwump, no normal person would try to do all\nthat at once, how can anyone not see that Dumbledore's trying\nto take over the world?\u202f\"",
      "\"Pause,\" Harry said, and closed his eyes to think.",
      "It wasn't any worse than what you would have heard about the\nWest in Stalin's Russia, and none of that would have been true.\nThough the blood purists wouldn't be able to get away with making\nstuff up entirely... or would they? The Daily Prophet had\nshown a pronounced tendency to make stuff up... but then again,\nwhen they stuck out their neck too far on the Weasley betrothal,\nthey had been called on it and they had been\nembarrassed...",
      "Harry opened his eyes, and saw that Draco was watching him with\na steady, waiting gaze.",
      "\"So when you asked me if it was time to join up with Dumbledore,\nthat was just a test.\"",
      "Draco nodded.",
      "\"And before that, when you said it sounded right -\"",
      "\"It sounds right,\" said Draco. \"But I don't know if I\ncan trust you. Are you going to complain about my testing\nyou, Mr. Potter? Are you going to say that I fooled you?\nThat I led you on?\u202f\"",
      "Harry knew he should smile like a good sport, but he couldn't\nreally, it was too much of a disappointment.",
      "\"You're right, it's fair, I can't complain,\" Harry said instead.\n\"So what about He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? Not as bad as he was made\nout to be?\"",
      "Draco looked bitter, at that. \"So you think it's all just making\nFather's side look good and Dumbledore's side look bad, and that I\nbelieve it all myself just because Father told me.\"",
      "\"It's a possibility I'm considering,\" Harry said evenly.",
      "Draco's voice was low and intense. \"They knew. My\nfather knew, his friends knew. They knew the Dark Lord was\nevil. But he was the only chance anyone had against\nDumbledore! The only wizard anywhere who was powerful enough\nto fight him! Some of the other Death Eaters were truly evil too,\nlike Bellatrix Black - Father isn't like that - but Father and his\nfriends had to do it, Harry, they had to,\nDumbledore was taking over everything, the Dark Lord was the only\nhope anyone had left!\"",
      "Draco was staring hard at Harry. Harry met the gaze, trying to\nthink. Nobody ever thought of themselves as the villain of their\nown story - maybe Lord Voldemort did, maybe Bellatrix did, but\nDraco certainly didn't. That the Death Eaters were bad guys was not\nin question. The question was whether they were the bad\nguys; whether there was one villain in the story, or\ntwo...",
      "\"You're not convinced,\" Draco said. He looked worried, and a\nlittle angry. Which didn't surprise Harry. He was pretty sure Draco\nhimself believed all this.",
      "\"Should I be convinced?\" Harry said. He didn't look\naway. \"Just because you believe it? Are you a strong enough\nrationalist now that your belief is strong evidence to me, because\nyou'd be very unlikely to believe it if it weren't true? When I met\nyou, you weren't that strong. Everything you told me, did you\nrethink it after you awakened as a scientist, or is it just\nsomething you grew up believing? Can you look me in the eyes and\nswear to me upon the honor of House Malfoy that if there's one\nuntruth buried in what you said, one thing that got added on just\nto make Dumbledore look a little worse, you would have\nnoticed?\"",
      "Draco started to open his mouth, and Harry said, \"Don't. Don't\nstain the honor of House Malfoy. You're not that strong\nyet, and you should know it. Listen, Draco, I've started to notice\nsome worrying things myself. But there's nothing definite,\nnothing certain, it's all just deductions and hypotheses\nand untrustworthy witnesses... And there's nothing certain in your\nstory, either. Dumbledore might've had some other good reason not\nto fight Grindelwald years earlier - though it would have\nto be a pretty good excuse, especially considering what was\nhappening on the Muggle side of things... but still. Is there one\nclearly evil thing that Dumbledore's done for certain, so\nI don't have to wonder?\"",
      "Draco's breathing was harsh. \"All right,\" Draco said in an\nuneven voice, \"I'll tell you what Dumbledore did.\" From Draco's\nrobes came a wand, and Draco said \"Quietus\", then \"Quietus\" again,\nbut he got the pronunciation wrong a second time, and finally Harry\ntook out his own wand and did it.",
      "\"There,\" said Draco hoarsely, \"once upon a time there, there was\na girl, and her name was Narcissa, and she was the prettiest, the\nsmartest, the most cunning girl that was ever Sorted into\nSlytherin, and my father loved her, and they married, and she\nwasn't a Death Eater, she wasn't a fighter, all she ever did\nwas love Father -\" Draco stopped there, because he was\ncrying.",
      "Harry felt sick to his stomach. Draco had never talked about his\nmother, not once, he should have noticed that earlier.\n\"She... got in the way of a curse?\"",
      "Draco's voice came out in a scream. \"Dumbledore burned her\nto death in her own bedroom!\u202f\"",
      "In a classroom filled with soft silver light, one boy is staring\nat another boy, who is sobbing, wiping frantically at his eyes with\nthe sleeves of his robes.",
      "It was hard for Harry to stay balanced, to keep withholding\njudgment, it was too emotional, there was something that either\nwanted to start tears from his own eyes in sympathy with Draco, or\nknow that it wasn't true...",
      "Dumbledore burned her to death in her own bedroom!",
      "That...",
      "...didn't sound like Dumbledore's style...",
      "...but you could only think that thought so many times, before\nyou started to wonder about the trustworthiness of that whole\n'style' concept.",
      "\"It, it must have hurt horribly,\" Draco said, his voice shaking,\n\"Father never talks about it at all, you don't ever talk about it\nin front of him, but Mr. Macnair told me, there were scorch marks\nall over the bedroom, from how Mother must have struggled while\nDumbledore burned her alive. That is the debt Dumbledore\nowes to House Malfoy and we will have his life for\nit!\u202f\"",
      "\"Draco,\" Harry said, he let all of the hoarseness into his own\nvoice, it would be wrong to sound calm, \"I'm sorry, I'm so\nsorry for asking, but I have to know, how do you\nknow it was Dumble-\"",
      "\"Dumbledore said he did it, he told Father it was a\nwarning! And Father couldn't testify under Veritaserum\nbecause he was an Occlumens, he couldn't even get Dumbledore put on\ntrial, Father's own allies didn't believe him after Dumbledore just\ndenied everything in public, but we know, the Death Eaters know,\nFather wouldn't have any reason to lie about that, Father would\nwant us to take revenge on the right person, can't you see\nthat Harry?\" Draco's voice was wild.",
      "Unless Lucius did it himself, of course, and found it more\nconvenient to blame Dumbledore.",
      "Although... it also didn't seem like Lucius's style.\nAnd if he had murdered Narcissa, it would have been\nsmarter to pin the blame on an easier victim instead of losing\npolitical capital and credibility by going after Dumbledore...",
      "In time, Draco stopped crying, and looked at Harry.\n\"Well?\u202f\" said Draco, sounding like he wanted to spit the\nwords. \"Is that evil enough for you, Mr. Potter?\"",
      "Harry looked down at where his arms rested on the back of his\nchair. He couldn't meet Draco's eyes any more, the pain in them was\ntoo raw. \"I wasn't expecting to hear that,\" Harry said softly. \"I\ndon't know what to think any more.\"",
      "\"You don't know?\u202f\" Draco's voice rose to a shriek, and\nhe stood up abruptly from his desk -",
      "\"I remembered the Dark Lord killing my parents,\" Harry said.\n\"When I went in front of the Dementor the first time, that was what\nI remembered, the worst memory. Even though it was so long ago. I\nheard them dying. My mother begged the Dark Lord not to kill me,\nnot Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead! That's\nwhat she said. And the Dark Lord mocked her, and laughed. Then, I\nremember, the flash of green light -\"",
      "Harry looked up at Draco.",
      "\"So we could fight,\" Harry said, \"we could just keep on with the\nsame fight. You could tell me that it was right for my mother to\ndie, because she was the wife of James, who killed a Death Eater.\nBut bad for your mother to die, because she was\ninnocent. And I could tell you that it was right for your mother to\ndie, that Dumbledore must have had some reason that made\nit okay to burn her alive in her own bedroom; but bad for\nmy mother to die. But you know, Draco, either way,\nwouldn't it be obvious that we were just being biased?\nBecause the rule that says that it's wrong to kill innocent people,\nthat rule can't switch on for my mother and off for yours, and it\ncan't switch on for your mother and off for mine. If you tell me\nthat Lily was an enemy of the Death Eaters and it's right to kill\nyour enemies, then the same rule says that Dumbledore was right to\nkill Narcissa, since she was his enemy.\" Harry's voice\nwent hoarse. \"So if the two of us are going to agree on anything,\nit's going to be that neither of their deaths were right\nand that no one's mother should die any more.\"",
      "The fury boiling inside Draco was so great that he could barely\nstop himself from storming out of the room; all that halted him was\nthe recognition of a critical moment; and a small remnant of\nfriendship, a tiny flash of sympathy, for he had forgotten, he'd\nforgotten, that Harry's mother and father were\ndead by the Dark Lord's hand.",
      "The silence stretched.",
      "\"You can talk,\" Harry said, \"Draco, talk to me, I won't get\nangry - are you thinking, I don't know, that Narcissa dying was\nmuch worse than Lily dying? That it's wrong for me even to make the\ncomparison?\"",
      "\"I guess I was stupid too,\" Draco said. \"All this time, all this\ntime I forgot that you must hate the Death Eaters for killing your\nparents, hate Death Eaters the way I hate Dumbledore.\" And Harry\nhad never said anything, never reacted when Draco talked about\nDeath Eaters, kept it hidden - Draco was a fool.",
      "\"No,\" Harry said. \"It's not - it's not like that, Draco, I, I\ndon't even know how to explain to you, except to say that a thought\nlike that, wouldn't,\" Harry's voice choked, \"you wouldn't ever be\nable to use it, to cast the Patronus Charm...\"",
      "Draco felt a sudden wrench in his heart, unwanted but he felt\nit. \"Are you pretending you're just going to forget about\nyour own parents? Are you saying I should just forget\nabout Mother?\"",
      "\"So you and I have to be enemies then?\" Now Harry's\nvoice was growing equally wild. \"What have we ever done to\neach other that means we have to be enemies? I refuse to\nbe trapped like that! Justice can't mean that both of us\nshould attack each other, it doesn't make sense!\" Harry\nstopped, took a deep breath, ran his fingers back through the\ndeliberate mess of his hair - the fingers came away sweaty, Draco\ncould see it. \"Draco, listen, we can't expect to meet on everything\nright away, you and I. So I won't ask you to say that the Dark Lord\nwas wrong to kill my mother, just say that it was...\nsad. We won't talk about whether or not it was\nnecessary, whether it was justified. I'll just\nask you to say that it was sad that it happened, that my mother's\nlife was valuable too, you'll just say that for now. And I'll say\nit was sad that Narcissa died, because her life was also worth\nsomething. We can't expect to agree on everything right away, but\nif we start out by saying that every life is precious, that it's\nsad when anyone dies, then I know we'll meet someday.\nThat's what I want you to say. Not who was right. Not who was\nwrong. Just that it was sad when your mother died, and sad when my\nmother died, and it would be sad if Hermione Granger died, every\nlife is precious, can we agree on that and let the rest go by for\nnow, is it enough if we just agree on that? Can we, Draco? That\nseems... more like a thought someone could use to cast the Patronus\nCharm.\"",
      "There were tears in Harry's eyes.",
      "And Draco was getting angry again. \"Dumbledore killed\nMother, it's not enough to just say it's sad! I don't\nunderstand what you think you have to do, but the Malfoys\nhave to take revenge!\" Not avenging the deaths of family\nwent beyond weakness, beyond dishonor, you might as well\nnot exist.",
      "\"I'm not arguing with that,\" Harry said quietly. \"But will you\nsay that Lily Potter's death was sad? Just say that one thing?\"",
      "\"That's...\" Draco was having difficulty finding words again. \"I\nknow, I know how you feel, but don't you see Harry, even if I just\nsay that Lily Potter's death was sad, that's\nalready going against the Death Eaters!\"",
      "\"Draco, you've got to be able to say the Death Eaters\nwere wrong about some things! You have to, you can't\nprogress as a scientist otherwise, there'll be a roadblock in your\nway, an authority you can't contradict. Not every change is an\nimprovement, but every improvement is a change, you can't do\nanything better unless you can manage to do it\ndifferently, you've got to let yourself do better than\nother people! Even your father, Draco, even him. You've got to\nbe able to point to something your father did and say it was\nmistaken, because he wasn't perfect, and if you can't say\nthat, you can't do better.\"",
      "Father had warned him, every night before he went to sleep for a\nmonth before he went to Hogwarts, that there would be people with\nthis goal.",
      "\"You're trying to break me loose of Father.\"",
      "\"Trying to break a part of you loose,\" said Harry.\n\"Trying to let you fix some things your father got mistaken. Trying\nto let you do better. But not... trying to break your\nPatronus!\u202f\" Harry's voice got softer. \"I wouldn't want to\nbreak something bright like that. Who knows, fixing Slytherin House\nmight need that, too...\"",
      "It was getting to Draco, that was the thing, despite everything\nit was getting to him, you had to be really careful around Harry\nbecause his arguments sounded so convincing even when he was\nwrong. \"And what you're not admitting is that\nDumbledore told you that you could avenge your parents' deaths by\ntaking Lord Malfoy's son from him -\"",
      "\"No. No. That part's just wrong.\" Harry took a deep\nbreath. \"I did not know who Dumbledore was, or who the Dark Lord\nwas, or who the Death Eaters were, or how my parents died, until\nthree days before I came to Hogwarts. The day you and I first met\nin the clothes shop, that was the day I learned. And Dumbledore\ndoesn't even like Muggle science, or he says he doesn't, I\ngot a chance to probe him on it once. The thought of taking revenge\non the Death Eaters through you has never crossed my mind,\nnot even once until now. I didn't know who the Malfoys\nwere when I met you in the clothes shop, and then I liked\nyou.\"",
      "There was a long silence.",
      "\"I wish I could trust you,\" Draco said. His voice was shaking.\n\"If I could just know you were telling the truth,\neverything would be so much simpler -\"",
      "And then suddenly it came to Draco.",
      "The way to know whether Harry Potter really meant everything he\nsaid, about wanting to fix Slytherin House, about being sad that\nMother had died.",
      "It would be illegal, and since he'd have to do it without\nFather's help, it would be dangerous, he couldn't even\ntrust Harry Potter to help, but...",
      "\"All right,\" Draco said. \"I've thought of a definitive\nexperiment.\"",
      "\"What is it?\"",
      "\"I want to give you a drop of Veritaserum,\" Draco said. \"Just\none drop, so you can't lie, but not enough to make you\nanswer anything. I don't know where I'll get it, but I'll make\ncertain it's safe -\"",
      "\"Um,\" Harry said. There was a helpless look on his face. \"Draco,\num -\"",
      "\"Don't say it,\" Draco said. His voice was firm and calm. \"If you\nsay no, that's my experimental result right there.\"",
      "\"Draco, I'm an Occlumens -\"",
      "\"OH THAT IS SUCH A LIE -\"",
      "\"I was trained by Mr. Bester. Professor Quirrell set it up.\nLook, Draco, I'll take one drop of Veritaserum if you can\nget it, I'm just warning you that I'm an Occlumens. Not a\nperfect Occlumens, but Mr. Bester said I was putting up a complete\nblock, and I could probably beat Veritaserum.\"",
      "\"You're in your first year at Hogwarts! That's just\ncrazy!\u202f\"",
      "\"Know a Legilimens you can trust? I'll be happy to demonstrate -\nlook, Draco, I'm sorry, but doesn't the fact that I told\nyou count for something? I could have just let you do it,\nyou know.\"",
      "\"WHY? Why are you always like this, Harry? Why do you have\nto mess everything up even when it's IMPOSSIBLE? And stop smiling,\nthis isn't funny!\u202f\"",
      "\"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I know it's not funny, I -\"",
      "It took a while for Draco to get himself under control.",
      "But Harry was right. Harry could have just let Draco\nadminister the Veritaserum. If he really was an\nOcclumens... Draco didn't know who he could ask to try Legilimency,\nbut he could at least ask Professor Quirrell if it was true...\nCould Draco trust Professor Quirrell? Maybe Professor\nQuirrell would just say anything Harry asked him to.",
      "Then Draco remembered the other thing Harry had told him to ask\nProfessor Quirrell, and thought of a different test.",
      "\"You know,\" said Draco. \"You know what it\ncosts me, if I agree that the poison in Slytherin's House is hating\nMuggleborns, and say that Lily Potter's death was sad. And that's\npart of your plan, don't tell me it's not.\"",
      "Harry said nothing, which was wise of him.",
      "\"There's something I want from you in return,\" said Draco. \"And\nbefore then, an experimental test I want to try -\"",
      "Draco pushed open the door to which the portraits had directed\nthem, and this time it was the right door. Before them was a small\nempty place of stone set against the night sky. Not a roof like the\none he'd dropped Harry from, but a tiny and proper courtyard, far\nabove the ground. With proper railings, elaborate traceries of\nstone that flushed seamlessly into the stone floor... How so much\nartistry had been infused into the creation of Hogwarts\nwas something that still awed Draco every time he thought about it.\nThere must have been some way to do it all at once, no one could\nhave detailed so much piece by piece, the castle changed\nand every new piece was like that. It was so far beyond the\nwizardry of these fading days that no one would have believed it if\nthey hadn't seen the proof in Hogwarts itself.",
      "Cloudless and cold, the winter night sky; it got dark long\nbefore students' curfew, in the final days of January.",
      "The stars shining brightly, in the clear air.",
      "Harry had said that being under the stars would help him.",
      "Draco touched his chest with his wand, slid his fingers in a\npracticed motion, and said, \"Thermos.\" A warmth spread\nthrough him, starting from his heart; the wind went on blowing on\nhis face, but he was no longer cold.",
      "\"Thermos,\" Harry's voice said behind him.",
      "They went together to the railing, to look down at the ground a\nlong way below. Draco tried to figure if they were in one of the\ntowers that could be seen from outside, and found that right now he\ncouldn't quite seem to picture how Hogwarts looked from outside.\nBut the ground below was always the same; he could see the\nForbidden Forest as a vague outline, and moonlight glittering from\nthe Hogwarts Lake.",
      "\"You know,\" Harry's voice said quietly from beside him where his\narms leaned on the railing next to Draco's, \"one of the things that\nMuggles get really wrong, is that they don't turn all their lights\nout at night. Not even for one hour every month, not even for\nfifteen minutes once a year. The photons scatter in the atmosphere\nand wash out all but the brightest stars, and the night sky doesn't\nlook the same at all, not unless you go far away from any cities.\nOnce you've looked up at the sky over Hogwarts, it's hard to\nimagine living in a Muggle city, where you wouldn't be able to see\nthe stars. You certainly wouldn't want to spend your whole life in\nMuggle cities, once you'd seen the night sky over Hogwarts.\"",
      "Draco glanced at Harry, and found that Harry was craning his\nneck to stare up at where the Milky Way arched across the\ndarkness.",
      "\"Of course,\" Harry went on, his voice still quiet, \"you can't\never see the stars properly from Earth, either, the air\nalways gets in the way. You have to look from somewhere else, if\nyou want to see the real thing, the stars burning hard and bright,\nlike their true selves. Have you ever wished that you could just\nwhisk yourself up into the night sky, Draco, and go look at what\nthere is to see around other Suns than ours? If there were no limit\nto the power of your magic, is that one of the things you would do,\nif you could do anything?\"",
      "There was a silence, and then Draco realized that he was\nexpected to answer. \"I didn't think of it before,\" Draco said.\nWithout any conscious decision, his voice came out as soft and\nhushed as Harry's. \"Do you really think anyone would ever be able\nto do that?\"",
      "\"I don't think it'll be that easy,\" said Harry. \"But I know I\ndon't mean to spend my whole life on Earth.\"",
      "It would have been something to laugh at, if Draco hadn't known\nthat some Muggles had already left, without even using magic.",
      "\"To pass your test,\" Harry said, \"I'm going to have to say what\nit means to me, that thought, the whole thing, not the\nshorter version I tried to explain to you before. But you should be\nable to see it's the same idea, only more general. So my\nversion of the thought, Draco, is that when we go out into the\nstars, we might find other people there. And if so, they certainly\nwon't look like we do. There might be things out there that are\ngrown from crystal, or big pulsating blobs... or they might be made\nof magic, now that I think about it. So with all that strangeness,\nhow do you recognize a person? Not by the shape, not by\nhow many arms or legs it has. Not by the sort of substance it's\nmade out of, whether that's flesh or crystal or stuff I can't\nimagine. You would have to recognize them as people from their\nminds. And even their minds wouldn't work just like ours\ndo. But anything that lives and thinks and knows itself and doesn't\nwant to die, it's sad, Draco, it's sad if that person has to die,\nbecause it doesn't want to. Compared to what might be out there,\nevery human being who ever lived, we're all like brothers and\nsisters, you could hardly even tell us apart. The ones out there\nwho met us, they wouldn't see British or French, they\nwouldn't be able to tell the difference, they'd just see a human\nbeing. Humans who can love, and hate, and laugh, and cry; and to\nthem, the ones out there, that would make us all as alike\nas peas in the same pod. They would be different, though.\nReally different. But that wouldn't stop us, and it\nwouldn't stop them, if we both wanted to be friends together.\"",
      "Harry raised his wand then, and Draco turned, and looked away,\nas he had promised; looked toward the stone floor and stone wall in\nwhich the door was set. For Draco had promised not to look, and not\nto tell anyone of what Harry had said, or anything at all of what\nhappened here this night, though he didn't know why it was to be so\nsecret.",
      "\"I have a dream,\" said Harry's voice, \"that one day sentient\nbeings will be judged by the patterns of their minds, and not their\ncolor or their shape or the stuff they're made of, or who their\nparents were. Because if we can get along with crystal things\nsomeday, how silly would it be not to get along with Muggleborns,\nwho are shaped like us, and think like us, as alike to us as peas\nin a pod? The crystal things wouldn't even be able to tell the\ndifference. How impossible is it to imagine that the hatred\npoisoning Slytherin House would be worth taking with us to the\nstars? Every life is precious, everything that thinks and knows\nitself and doesn't want to die. Lily Potter's life was precious,\nand Narcissa Malfoy's life was precious, even though it's too late\nfor them now, it was sad when they died. But there are other lives\nthat are still alive to be fought for. Your life, and my life, and\nHermione Granger's life, all the lives of Earth, and all the lives\nbeyond, to be defended and protected, EXPECTO\nPATRONUM!\u202f\"",
      "And there was light.",
      "Everything turned to silver in that light, the stone floor, the\nstone wall, the door, the railings, so dazzling just in the\nreflection that you could hardly even see them, even the air seemed\nto shine, and the light grew brighter, and brighter, and brighter\n-",
      "When the light ended it was like a shock, Draco's hand went\nautomatically to his robe to bring out a handkerchief, and it was\nonly then that he realized he was crying.",
      "\"There is your experimental result,\" Harry's voice said quietly.\n\"I really did mean it, that thought.\"",
      "Draco slowly turned toward Harry, who had lowered his wand\nnow.",
      "\"That, that's got to be a trick, right?\" Draco said. He couldn't\ntake many more of these shocks. \"Your Patronus - can't\nreally be that bright -\" And yet it had been\nPatronus light, once you knew what you were looking at, you\ncouldn't mistake it for anything else.",
      "\"That was the true form of the Patronus Charm,\" Harry\nsaid. \"Something that lets you put all your strength into the\nPatronus, without hindrance from within yourself. And before you\nask, I did not learn it from Dumbledore. He does not know the\nsecret, and could not cast the true form if he did. I solved the\npuzzle for myself. And I knew, once I understood, that this spell\nmust not be spoken of. For your sake, I undertook your test; but\nyou must not speak of it, Draco.\"",
      "Draco didn't know any more, he didn't know where the true\nstrength lay, or the right of things. Double vision, double vision.\nDraco wanted to call Harry's ideals weakness, Hufflepuff\nfoolishness, the sort of lie that rulers told to placate the\npopulace and that Harry had been silly enough to believe for\nhimself, foolishness taken seriously and raised up to insane\nheights, projected out onto the stars themselves -",
      "Something beautiful and hidden, mysterious and bright -",
      "\"Will I,\" whispered Draco, \"be able to cast a Patronus like\nthat, someday?\"",
      "\"If you always keep seeking the truth,\" Harry said, \"and if you\ndon't refuse the warm thoughts when you find them, then I'm sure\nyou will. I think a person could get anywhere if they just kept\ngoing long enough, even to the stars.\"",
      "Draco wiped his eyes with his handkerchief again.",
      "\"We should go back inside,\" Draco said in an unsteady voice,\n\"someone could've seen it, all that light -\"",
      "Harry nodded, and moved to and through the door; and Draco\nlooked up at the night sky one last time before he followed.",
      "Who was the Boy-Who-Lived, that he was already an\nOcclumens, and could cast the true form of the Patronus Charm, and\ndo other strange things? What was Harry's Patronus, why must it\nstay unseen?",
      "Draco didn't ask any of those questions, because Harry might\nhave answered, and Draco just couldn't take any more\nshocks today. He just couldn't. One more shock and his\nhead was going to just fall right off his shoulders and go bounce,\nbounce, bounce down the corridors of Hogwarts.",
      "They'd ducked into a small alcove, instead of going all the way\nback to the classroom, at Draco's request; he was feeling too\nnervous to put it off any longer.",
      "Draco put up a Quieting barrier, and then looked at Harry in\nsilent question.",
      "\"I've been thinking about it,\" Harry said. \"I'll do it, but\nthere are five conditions -\"",
      "\"Five?\u202f\"",
      "\"Yes, five. Look, Draco, a pledge like this is just\nbegging to go terribly wrong somehow, you know it\nwould go wrong if this were a play -\"",
      "\"Well, it's not!\" Draco said. \"Dumbledore killed Mother. He's\nevil. It's one of those things you talk about that doesn't\nhave to be complicated.\"",
      "\"Draco,\" Harry said, his voice careful, \"all I know is\nthat you say that Lucius says that\nDumbledore says he killed Narcissa. To believe that\nunquestioningly, I have to trust you and Lucius\nand Dumbledore. So like I said, there are conditions. The\nfirst one is that at any point you can release me from the\npledge, if it no longer seems like a good idea. It has to be a\ndeliberate and intended decision on your part, of course, not a\ntrick of wording or something.\"",
      "\"Okay,\" said Draco. That sounded safe enough.",
      "\"Condition two is that I'm pledging to take as an enemy whoever\nactually did kill Narcissa, as determined to the honest best of my\nability as a rationalist. Whether that's Dumbledore, or someone\nelse. And you have my word that I'll exercise my best ability as a\nrationalist to keep that judgment honest, as a question of simple\nfact. Agreed?\"",
      "\"I don't like it,\" said Draco. He didn't, the whole point was to\nmake sure Harry never went with Dumbledore. Still, if Harry\nwas honest, he'd catch on to Dumbledore soon enough; and\nif dishonest, he'd already broken his word... \"But I'll agree.\"",
      "\"Condition three is that Narcissa has to have been burned\nalive. If that part of the story turns out to be something\nexaggerated just to make it sound a little worse, then I get to\ndecide for myself whether or not to still go through with the\npledge. Good people sometimes have to kill. But they don't ever\ntorture people to death. It's because Narcissa was burned\nalive that I know whoever did that was evil.\"",
      "Draco kept his temper, barely.",
      "\"Condition four is that if Narcissa got her own hands dirty,\nand, say, Crucioed someone's child into insanity, and that\nperson burned Narcissa for revenge, the deal might be off again.\nBecause then it was still wrong for them to burn her, they still\nshould've just killed her without pain; but it wasn't evil\nthe same way as if she was just Lucius's love who never did\nanything herself, like you said. Condition five is that if whoever\nkilled Narcissa was tricked somehow into doing it, then my enemy is\nwhoever tricked them, not the person who was tricked.\"",
      "\"All this really sounds like you're planning to weasel\nout of it -\"",
      "\"Draco, I won't take a good person as an enemy, not for you or\nanyone. I have to really believe they're in the wrong. But I've\nthought about it, and it seems to me that if Narcissa didn't do any\nevil with her own hands, just fell in love with Lucius and chose to\nstay his wife, then whoever burned her alive in her own bedroom\nisn't likely to be a good guy. And I'll pledge to take as my enemy\nwhoever made that happen, whether it's Dumbledore or anyone else,\nunless you deliberately release me from that pledge. Hopefully\nthat won't go wrong the way it would if this were a\nplay.\"",
      "\"I'm not happy,\" said Draco. \"But okay. You pledge to take my\nmother's murderer as your enemy, and I'll -\"",
      "Harry waited, with a patient look on his face, while Draco tried\nto make his voice work again.",
      "\"I'll help you fix the problem with Slytherin House hating\nMuggleborns,\" Draco finished in a whisper. \"And I'll say it was sad\nthat Lily Potter died.\"",
      "\"So be it,\" said Harry.",
      "And it was done.",
      "The break, Draco knew, had just widened a little more. No, not a\nlittle, a lot. There was a sensation of drifting away, of\nbeing lost, further and further from shore, further and further\nfrom home...",
      "\"Excuse me,\" Draco said. He turned away from Harry, and then\ntried to calm himself, he had to do this test, and he didn't want\nto fail it from being nervous or ashamed.",
      "Draco raised his wand into the starting position for the\nPatronus Charm.",
      "Remembered falling from his broomstick, the pain, the fear,\nimagined it coming from a tall figure in a cloak, looking like a\ndead thing left in water.",
      "And then Draco closed his eyes, the better to remember Father\nholding his small, cold hands in his own warm strength.",
      "Don't be frightened, my son, I'm here...",
      "The wand swung up in a broad brandish, to drive the fear away,\nand Draco was surprised at the strength of it; and he remembered in\nthat moment that Father wasn't lost, would never be lost,\nwould always be there and strong in his own person, no matter what\nhappened to Draco, and his voice cried, \"Expecto\nPatronum!\"",
      "Draco opened his eyes.",
      "A shining snake looked back at him, no less bright than\nbefore.",
      "Behind him, he heard Harry exhale a breath, as though\nin relief.",
      "Draco gazed into the white light. It seemed he wasn't lost\ncompletely, after all.",
      "\"That reminds me,\" said Harry after a while. \"Can we test my\nhypothesis about how to use a Patronus to send messages?\"",
      "\"Is it going to surprise me?\" said Draco. \"I don't want any more\nsurprises today.\"",
      "Harry had claimed that the idea wasn't all that strange and he\ndidn't see how it could possibly shock Draco in any way, which made\nDraco feel even more nervous, somehow; but Draco could see how\nimportant it was to have a way of sending messages in\nemergencies.",
      "The trick - or so Harry hypothesized - was wanting to spread the\ngood news, wanting the recipient to know the truth of whatever\nhappy thought you'd used to cast the Patronus Charm. Only instead\nof telling the recipient in words, the Patronus itself was the\nmessage. By wanting them to see that, the Patronus would go to\nthem.",
      "\"Tell Harry,\" said Draco to the luminous snake, even though\nHarry was standing only a few paces away on the other side of the\nroom, \"to, um, beware the green monkey,\" this being a sign from a\nplay Draco had once seen.",
      "And then, just like at King's Cross station, Draco wanted Harry\nto know that Father had always cared for him; only this time he\ndidn't try to say it in words, but wanted to say it with the happy\nthought itself.",
      "The bright snake slithered across the room, looking more like it\nwas slithering through the air rather than the stone itself; it got\nto Harry after traveling that short distance -",
      "- and said to Harry, in a strange voice that Draco recognized as\nhow he himself probably sounded to other people, \"Beware the green\nmonkey.\"",
      "\"Hsssss ssss sshsshssss,\" said Harry.",
      "The snake slithered back across the floor to Draco.",
      "\"Harry says the message is received and acknowledged,\" said the\nshining Blue Krait in Draco's voice.",
      "\"Huh,\" Harry said. \"Talking to Patronuses feels odd.\"",

      "\"You mean just magical snakes, right?\"",
      "\"N-no,\" said Draco. He was looking rather pale, and was still\nstammering, but had at least stopped the incoherent noises he'd\nbeen making earlier. \"You're a Parselmouth, you can speak\nParseltongue, it's the language of all snakes everywhere.

      "It was Saturday, the first morning of February, and at the\nRavenclaw table, a boy bearing a breakfast plate heaped high with\nvegetables was nervously inspecting his servings for the slightest\ntrace of meat.",
      "It might have been an overreaction. After he'd gotten\nover the raw shock, Harry's common sense had woken up and\nhypothesized that \"Parseltongue\" was probably just a linguistic\nuser interface for controlling snakes...",
      "...after all, snakes couldn't really be human-level\nintelligent, someone would have noticed by now. The\nsmallest-brained creatures Harry had ever heard of with anything\nlike linguistic ability were the African grey parrots taught by\nIrene Pepperberg. And that was unstructured protolanguage, in a\nspecies that played complex games of adultery and needed to model\nother parrots. While according to what Draco had been able to\nremember, snakes spoke to Parselmouths in what sounded like normal\nhuman language - i.e., full-blown recursive syntactical grammar.\nThat had taken time for hominids to evolve, with huge\nbrains and strong social selection pressures. Snakes didn't have\nmuch society at all that Harry had ever heard. And with thousands\nupon thousands of different species of snakes all over the world,\nhow could they all use the same version of their supposed\nlanguage, \"Parseltongue\"?",
      "Of course that was all merely common sense, in which Harry was\nstarting to lose faith entirely.",
      "But Harry was sure he'd heard snakes hissing on the TV at some\npoint - after all, he knew what that sounded like from\nsomewhere - and that hadn't sounded to him like\nlanguage, which had seemed a good deal more reassuring...",
      "...at first. The problem was that Draco had also asserted that\nParselmouths could send snakes on extended complex missions. And if\nthat was true, then Parselmouths had to make snakes\npersistently intelligent by talking to them. In the worst-case\nscenario that would make the snake self-aware, like what Harry had\naccidentally done to the Sorting Hat.",
      "And when Harry had offered that hypothesis, Draco had\nclaimed that he could remember a story - Harry hoped to Cthulhu\nthat this one story was just a fairy tale, it had that\nring to it, but there was a story - about Salazar\nSlytherin sending a brave young viper on a mission to gather\ninformation from other snakes.",
      "If any snake a Parselmouth had talked to, could make\nother snakes self-aware by talking to them,\nthen...",
      "Then...",
      "Harry didn't even know why his mind was going all \"then...\nthen...\" when he knew perfectly well how the exponential\nprogression would work, it was just the sheer moral horror of it\nthat was blowing his mind.",
      "And what if someone had invented a spell like that to talk to\ncows?",
      "What if there were Poultrymouths?",
      "Or for that matter...",
      "Harry froze in sudden realization just as the forkful of carrots\nwas about to enter his mouth.",
      "That couldn't, couldn't possibly be true, surely no wizard\nwould be stupid enough to do THAT...",
      "And Harry knew, with a dreadful sinking feeling, that of\ncourse they would be that stupid. Salazar Slytherin had\nprobably never considered the moral implications of snake\nintelligence for even one second, just like it hadn't ever occurred\nto Salazar that Muggleborns were intelligent enough to\ndeserve personhood rights. Most people just didn't see moral issues\nat all unless someone else was pointing them out...",
      "\"Harry?\" said Terry from beside him, sounding like he was afraid\nhe would regret asking. \"Why are you staring at your fork like\nthat?\"",
      "\"I'm starting to think magic should be illegal,\" said Harry. \"By\nthe way, have you ever heard any stories about wizards who could\nspeak with plants?\"",
      "Terry hadn't heard of anything like that.",
      "Neither had any seventh-year Ravenclaws that Harry had\nasked.",
      "And now Harry had returned to his place, but not yet sat down\nagain, staring at his plate of vegetables with a forlorn\nexpression. He was getting hungrier, and later in the day he would\nbe visiting Mary's Place for one of their incredibly tasty\ndishes... Harry was finding himself sorely tempted to just revert\nback to yesterday's eating habits and be done with it.",
      "You've got to eat something, said his inner Slytherin.\nAnd it's not all that much more likely that anyone\nsneezed self-awareness onto poultry than onto plants, so as long as\nyou're eating food of questionable sentience either way, why not\neat the delicious deep-fried Diracawl slices?",
      "I'm not quite sure that's valid utilitarian logic, there\n-",
      "Oh, you want utilitarian logic? One serving of utilitarian\nlogic coming up: Even in the unlikely chance that some moron\ndid manage to confer sentience on chickens, it's your\nresearch that stands the best chance of discovering the fact\nand doing something about it. If you can complete your work even\nslightly faster by not messing around with your diet,\nthen, counterintuitive as it may seem, the best thing you\ncan do to save the greatest number of possibly-sentient\nwho-knows-whats is not wasting time on wild guesses about\nwhat might be intelligent. It's not like the house elves haven't\nprepared the food already, regardless of what you take onto your\nplate.",
      "Harry considered this for a moment. It was a rather seductive\nline of reasoning -",
      "Good! said Slytherin. I'm glad you see now that the\nmost moral thing to do is to sacrifice the lives of sentient beings\nfor your own convenience, to feed your dreadful appetites, for the\nsick pleasure of ripping them apart with your teeth -",
      "What? Harry thought indignantly. Which side are\nyou on here?",
      "His inner Slytherin's mental voice was grim. You too will\nsomeday embrace the doctrine... that the end justifies the\nmeats. This was followed by some mental snickering.",
      "Ever since Harry had started worrying that plants might also be\nsentient, his non-Ravenclaw components had been having trouble\ntaking his moral caution seriously. Hufflepuff was shouting\nCannibalism! every time Harry tried to think about any\nfood item whatsoever, and Gryffindor would visualize it screaming\nwhile he ate it, even if it was, say, a sandwich -",
      "Cannibalism!",
      "AIIIEEEE DON'T EAT ME -",
      "Ignore the screams, eat it anyway! It's a safe place to\ncompromise your ethics in the service of higher goals,\neveryone else thinks it's okay to eat sandwiches so you\ncan't use your usual rationalization about a small probability of a\nlarge downside if you get caught -",
      "Harry gave a mental sigh, and thought, Just so long as\nyou're okay with us being eaten by giant monsters that\ndidn't do enough research into whether we were\nsentient.",
      "I'm okay with that, said Slytherin. Is everyone\nelse okay with that? (Internal mental nods.) Great, can we\ngo back to deep-fried Diracawl slices now?",
      "Not until I've done some more research into what's sentient\nand what isn't. Now shut up. And Harry turned firmly away from\nhis plate full of oh-so-tempting vegetables to head toward the\nlibrary -",
      "Just eat the students, said Hufflepuff. There's no\ndoubt about whether they're sentient.",
      "You know you want to, said Gryffindor. I bet the\nyoung ones are the tastiest.",
      "Harry was starting to wonder if the Dementor had somehow damaged\ntheir imaginary personalities.",
      "\"Honestly,\" said Hermione. The young girl's voice\nsounded a little acerbic as her gaze scanned the bookshelves of the\nHerbology stacks in the Hogwarts library. Harry had left her a\nmessage asking if she could come to the library after she'd\nfinished breakfast, which Harry had skipped; but then when Harry\nhad introduced the day's topic she'd seemed a bit nonplussed. \"You\nknow your problem, Harry? You've got no sense of priorities. An\nidea gets into your head and you just go running straight off after\nit.\"",
      "\"I've got a great sense of priorities,\" said Harry. His\nhand reached out and grabbed Vegetable Cunning by Casey\nMcNamara, and began to flip through the starting pages, searching\nfor the table of contents. \"That's why I want to find out whether\nplants can talk before I eat my carrots.\"",
      "\"Don't you think that maybe the two of us have more\nimportant things to worry about?\"",
      "You sound just like Draco, Harry thought, but of course\ndidn't say out loud. Out loud he said, \"What could\npossibly be more important than plants turning out to be\nsentient?\"",
      "There was a pregnant silence from beside him, as Harry's eyes\nwent down the table of contents. There was indeed a chapter on\nPlant Language, causing Harry's heart to skip a beat; and then his\nhands began to rapidly turn the pages, heading for the appropriate\npage number.",
      "\"There are days,\" said Hermione Granger, \"when I really, truly,\nhave absolutely no idea what goes on inside that head of\nyours.\"",
      "\"Look, it's a question of multiplication, okay? There's a\nlot of plants in the world, if they're not\nsentient then they're not important, but if plants are\npeople then they've got more moral weight than all the human beings\nin the world put together. Now, of course your brain doesn't\nrealize that on an intuitive level, but that's because the brain\ncan't multiply. Like if you ask three separate groups of Canadian\nhouseholds how much they'll pay to save two thousand, twenty\nthousand, or two hundred thousand birds from dying in oil ponds,\nthe three groups will respectively state that they're willing to\npay seventy-eight, eighty-eight, and eighty dollars. No difference,\nin other words. It's called scope insensitivity. Your brain\nimagines a single bird struggling in an oil pond, and that image\ncreates some amount of emotion that determines your willingness to\npay. But no one can visualize even two thousand of anything, so the\nquantity just gets thrown straight out the window. Now try\nto correct that bias with respect to a hundred\ntrillion sentient blades of grass, and you'll realize that\nthis could be thousands of times more important than we used to\nthink the whole human species was... oh thank Azathoth, this says\nit's just mandrakes that can talk and they speak regular human\nlanguage out loud, not that there's a spell you can use to talk\nwith any plant -\"",
      "\"Ron came to me at breakfast yesterday morning,\" Hermione said.\nNow her voice sounded a little quiet, a little sad, maybe even a\nlittle scared. \"He said he'd been dreadfully shocked to see me kiss\nyou. That what you said while you were Demented should've shown me\nhow much evil you were hiding inside. And that if I was going to be\na follower of a Dark Wizard, then he wasn't sure he wanted to be in\nmy army anymore.\"",
      "Harry's hands had stopped turning pages. It seemed that Harry's\nbrain, for all its abstract knowledge, was still incapable of\nappreciating scope on any real emotional level, because it had just\nforcibly redirected his attention away from trillions of\npossibly-sentient blades of grass who might be suffering or dying\neven as they spoke, and toward the life of a single human being who\nhappened to be nearer and dearer.",
      "\"Ron is the world's most gigantic prat,\" Harry said. \"They won't\nbe printing that in the newspaper anytime soon, because it's not\nnews. So after you fired him, how many of his arms and legs did you\nbreak?\"",
      "\"I tried to tell him it wasn't like that,\" Hermione went on in\nthe same quiet voice. \"I tried to tell him you weren't\nlike that, and that it wasn't like that between the two of us, but\nit just seemed to make him even more... more like he was.\"",
      "\"Well, yes,\" Harry said. He was surprised that he wasn't feeling\nangrier at Captain Weasley, but his concern for Hermione seemed to\nbe overriding that, for now. \"The more you try to justify yourself\nto people like that, the more it acknowledges that they have the\nright to question you. It shows you think they get to be\nyour inquisitor, and once you grant someone that sort of power over\nyou, they just push more and more.\" This was one of Draco Malfoy's\nlessons which Harry had thought was actually pretty smart: people\nwho tried to defend themselves got questioned over every\nlittle point and could never satisfy their interrogators; but if\nyou made it clear from the start that you were a celebrity and\nabove social conventions, people's minds wouldn't bother tracking\nmost violations. \"That's why when Ron came over to me as I\nwas sitting down at the Ravenclaw table, and told me to stay away\nfrom you, I held my hand out over the floor and said, 'You see how\nhigh I'm holding my hand? Your intelligence has to be at least this\nhigh to talk to me.' Then he accused me of, quote, sucking you into\nthe darkness, unquote, so I pursed my lips and went\nschluuuuurp, and after that his mouth was still making\nthose talking noises so I put up a Quieting Charm. I don't think\nhe'll be trying his lectures on me again.\"",
      "\"I understand why you did that,\" Hermione said, her voice tight,\n\"I wanted to tell him off too, but I really wish you\nhadn't, it will make things harder for me, Harry!\"",
      "Harry looked up from Vegetable Cunning again, he wasn't\ngetting any reading done at this rate; and he saw that Hermione was\nstill reading whatever book she had, not looking up at him. Her\nhands turned another page even as he watched.",
      "\"I think you're taking the wrong approach by trying to defend\nyourself at all,\" Harry said. \"I really do think that. You are who\nyou are. You're friends with whoever you choose. Tell anyone who\nquestions you to shove it.\"",
      "Hermione just shook her head, and turned another page.",
      "\"Option two,\" Harry said. \"Go to Fred and George and tell them\nto have a little talk with their wayward brother, those\ntwo are genuine good guys -\"",
      "\"It's not just Ron,\" Hermione said in almost a whisper. \"Lots of\npeople are saying it, Harry. Even Mandy is giving me worried looks\nwhen she thinks I'm not looking. Isn't it funny? I keep worrying\nthat Professor Quirrell is sucking you into the darkness,\nand now people are warning me just the same way I try to warn\nyou.\"",
      "\"Well, yeah,\" said Harry. \"Doesn't that reassure you a\nbit about me and Professor Quirrell?\"",
      "\"In a word,\" said Hermione, \"no.\"",
      "There was a silence that lasted long enough for Hermione to turn\nanother page, and then her voice, in a real whisper this time,\n\"And, and Padma is going around telling everyone that, that since I\ncouldn't cast the P-Patronus Charm, I must only be p-pretending to\nbe n-nice...\"",
      "\"Padma didn't even try herself!\" Harry said\nindignantly. \"If you were a Dark Witch who was just\npretending, you wouldn't have tried in front of everyone,\ndo they think you're stupid?\u202f\"",
      "Hermione smiled a little, and blinked a few times.",
      "\"Hey, I have to worry about actually going\nevil. Here the worst case scenario is that people think\nyou're more evil than you really are. Is that going to kill you? I\nmean, is it all that bad?\"",
      "The young girl nodded, her face screwed up tight.",
      "\"Look, Hermione... if you worry that much about what other\npeople think, if you're unhappy whenever other people don't picture\nyou exactly the same way you picture yourself, that's\nalready dooming yourself to always be unhappy. No one ever\nthinks of us just the same way we think of ourselves.\"",
      "\"I don't know how to explain to you,\" Hermione said in a sad\nsoft voice. \"I'm not sure it's something you could ever understand,\nHarry. All I can think of to say is, how would you feel if\nI thought you were evil?\"",
      "\"Um...\" Harry visualized it. \"Yeah, that would hurt. A\nlot. But you're a good person who thinks about that sort of thing\nintelligently, you've earned that power over me, it would\nmean something if you thought I'd gone wrong. I can't\nthink of a single other student, besides you, whose opinion I'd\ncare about the same way -\"",
      "\"You can live like that,\" whispered Hermione Granger. \"I\ncan't.\"",
      "The girl had gone through another three pages in silence, and\nHarry had returned his eyes to his own book and was trying to\nregain his focus, when Hermione finally said, in a small voice,\n\"Are you really sure I mustn't know how to cast the Patronus\nCharm?\"",
      "\"I...\" Harry had to swallow a sudden lump in his throat. He\nsuddenly saw himself not knowing why the Patronus Charm\ndidn't work for him, not being able to show Draco, just\nbeing told that there was a reason, and nothing more. \"Hermione,\nyour Patronus would shine with the same light but it wouldn't be\nnormal, it wouldn't look like people think Patronuses\nshould look, anyone who saw it would know there was something\nstrange going on. Even if I told you the secret you couldn't\ndemonstrate to anyone, unless you made them face the other\nway so they could only see the light, and... and the most important\npart of any secret is the knowledge that a secret exists, you could\nonly show one or two friends if you swore them to secrecy...\"\nHarry's voice trailed off helplessly.",
      "\"I'll take it.\" Her voice was still small.",
      "It was very hard not to just blurt out the secret, right there\nin the library.",
      "\"I, I shouldn't, I really shouldn't, it's\ndangerous, Hermione, it could do a lot of harm if that\nsecret got out! Haven't you heard the saying, three can keep a\nsecret if two are dead? That telling just your closest friends is\nthe same as telling everyone, because you're not just trusting\nthem, you're trusting everyone they trust? It's too important, too\nmuch of a risk, it's not the sort of decision that should be made\nfor the sake of fixing someone's reputation at school!\"",
      "\"Okay,\" Hermione said. She closed the book and put it back on\nthe shelf. \"I can't concentrate right now, Harry, I'm sorry.\"",
      "\"If there's anything else I can do -\"",
      "\"Be nicer to everyone.\"",
      "The girl didn't look back as she walked out of the stacks, which\nmight have been a good thing, because the boy was frozen in place,\nunmoving.",
      "After a while, the boy started turning pages again."

      "A boy waits at a small clearing at the edge of the non-forbidden\nforest, beside a dirt trail that runs back to the gates of Hogwarts\nin one direction, and off into the distance in another. There is a\ncarriage nearby, and the boy is standing well away from it, looking\nat it, his eyes seldom wavering from its direction.",
      "In the distance, a figure is approaching along the dirt path: A\nman wearing professorial robes, trudging slowly with his shoulders\nslumped low, his formal shoes kicking up small clouds of dust as he\nwalks.",
      "Half a minute later, the boy darts another quick glance before\nreturning to his surveillance; and this glimpse shows that the\nman's shoulders have straightened, his face unslackened, and that\nhis shoes are now walking lightly across the dirt, leaving not a\ntrace of dust in the air behind.",
      "\"Hello, Professor Quirrell,\" Harry said without letting his eyes\nmove again from the direction of their carriage.",
      "\"Salutations,\" said the calm voice of Professor Quirrell. \"You\nseem to be keeping your distance, Mr. Potter. I don't suppose you\nsee something odd about our conveyance?\"",
      "\"Odd?\" Harry echoed. \"Why no, I can't say I see anything odd.\nThere seem to be even numbers of everything. Four seats, four\nwheels, two huge skeletal winged horses...\"",
      "A skin-wrapped skull turned to look at him and flashed teeth,\nsolid and white in that black cavernous mouth, as though to\nindicate that it was just about as fond of him as he was of it. The\nother black leathery horse-skeleton tossed its head like it was\nwhickering, but there was no sound.",
      "\"They are Thestrals, and they have always drawn the carriage,\"\nProfessor Quirrell said, sounding quite undisturbed as he climbed\ninto the front bench of the carriage, sitting down as far to the\nright as possible. \"They are visible only to those who have seen\ndeath and comprehended it, a useful defense against most animal\npredators. Hm. I suppose that the first time you went in front of\nthe Dementor, your worst memory proved to be the night of your\nencounter with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?\"",
      "Harry nodded grimly. It was the right guess, even if for the\nwrong reasons. Those who have seen Death...",
      "\"Did you recall anything of interest, thereby?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry said, \"I did,\" only that and nothing more, for he\nwas not ready as yet to make accusations.",
      "The Defense Professor smiled one of his dry smiles, and beckoned\nwith an impatient finger.",
      "Harry closed the distance and climbed into the carriage,\nwincing. The sense of doom had grown significantly stronger after\nthe day of the Dementor, even though it had been slowly weakening\nbefore then. The greatest distance that the carriage allowed him\nfrom Professor Quirrell no longer seemed like nearly far\nenough.",
      "Then the skeletal horses trotted forward and the carriage\nstarted in motion, taking them toward the outer bounds of Hogwarts.\nAs it did, Professor Quirrell slumped back down into zombie-mode,\nand the sense of doom retreated, though it still hovered at the\nedge of Harry's perceptions, unignorable...",
      "The forest scrolled by as the carriage rolled along, the trees\nmoving past at a speed that seemed positively glacial by comparison\nto broomsticks or even cars. There was something oddly relaxing,\nHarry thought, about traveling that slowly. It had certainly\nrelaxed the Defense Professor, who was slumped over with a small\nstream of drool coming out of his slack mouth and puddling on his\nrobes.",
      "Harry still hadn't decided what he was allowed to eat for\nlunch.",
      "His library research hadn't turned up any sign of wizards\nspeaking to nonmagical plants. Or any other nonmagical animals\nbesides snakes, although Spell and Speak by Paul Breedlove\nhad recounted the probably-mythical tale of a sorceress called the\nLady of Flying Squirrels.",
      "What Harry wanted to do was ask Professor Quirrell. The\nproblem was that Professor Quirrell was too smart. Judging\nby what Draco had said, the Heir of Slytherin business was a major\nbombshell, and Harry wasn't sure he wanted anyone else to know. And\nthe instant Harry asked about Parseltongue, Professor Quirrell\nwould fix him with those pale blue eyes and say, 'I see, Mr.\nPotter, so you taught Mr. Malfoy the Patronus Charm and\naccidentally spoke to his snake.'",
      "It wouldn't matter that it shouldn't be enough evidence\nto locate the true explanation as a hypothesis, let alone overcome\nits burden of prior improbability. Somehow the Defense Professor\nwould deduce it anyway. There were times when Harry\nsuspected that Professor Quirrell had way more background\ninformation than he was telling, his priors were simply too good.\nSometimes he got his amazing deductions right even when his\nreasons were wrong. The problem was that Harry couldn't\nsee how Professor Quirrell could've snuck in an extra clue about\nhalf the stuff he guessed. Just once Harry would have\nliked to make some sort of incredible deduction from something\nProfessor Quirrell said which would catch him completely\noff guard.",
      "\"I shall have a bowl of green lentil soup, with soy sauce,\"\nProfessor Quirrell said to the waitress. \"And for Mr. Potter, a\nplate of Tenorman's family chili.\"",
      "Harry hesitated in sudden dismay. He'd resolved to stick to\nvegetarian dishes for the moment, but he'd forgotten in his\ndeliberations that Professor Quirrell did the actual\nordering - and it would be awkward if he protested now -",
      "The waitress bowed to them, and turned to go -",
      "\"Erm, excuse me, any meat in that from snakes or flying\nsquirrels?\"",
      "The waitress didn't so much as blink an eye, only turned back to\nHarry, shook her head, bowed politely to him again, and resumed her\nwalk toward the door.",
      "(The other parts of Harry were snickering at him. Gryffindor was\nmaking sardonic comments about how a little social discomfort was\nenough to get him to resort to Cannibalism! (shouted by\nHufflepuff), and Slytherin was remarking on how nice it was that\nHarry's ethics were flexible when it came to important goals like\nmaintaining his relationship with Professor Quirrell.)",
      "After the waitress had closed the door behind her, Professor\nQuirrell waved a hand to slide home the locking bar, spoke the\nusual four Charms to ensure privacy, and then said, \"An interesting\nquestion, Mr. Potter. I wonder why you asked it?\"",
      "Harry kept his face steady. \"I was looking up some facts about\nthe Patronus Charm earlier,\" he said. \"According to The\nPatronus Charm: Wizards Who Could and Couldn't, it turns out\nthat Godric couldn't and Salazar could. I was surprised, so I\nlooked up the reference, in Four Lives of Power. And\nthen I discovered that Salazar Slytherin could supposedly\ntalk to snakes.\" (Temporal sequence wasn't the same as causation,\nit wasn't Harry's fault if Professor Quirrell missed that.)\n\"Further research turned up an old story about a mother goddess\ntype who could talk to flying squirrels. I was a bit worried about\nthe prospect of eating something that could talk.\"",
      "And Harry took a casual sip of his water -",
      "- just as Professor Quirrell said, \"Mr. Potter, would I be\ncorrect in guessing that you are also a Parselmouth?\"",
      "When Harry was done coughing, he set his glass of water back\ndown on the table, fixed his gaze on Professor Quirrell's chin\nrather than looking him in the eyes, and said, \"So you are able to\nperform Legilimency through my Occlumency barriers, then.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell was grinning widely. \"I shall take that as a\ncompliment, Mr. Potter, but no.\"",
      "\"I'm not buying this anymore,\" Harry said. \"There's no\nway you came to that conclusion based on that\nevidence.\"",
      "\"Of course not,\" Professor Quirrell said equably. \"I had planned\nto ask you that question today in any case, and simply chose an\nopportune moment. I have suspected since December, in fact -\"",
      "\"December?\u202f\" said Harry. \"I found out\nyesterday!\u202f\"",
      "\"Ah, so you did not realize the Sorting Hat's message to you was\nin Parseltongue?\"",
      "The Defense Professor had timed it exactly right the second\ntime, too, just as Harry was taking a gulp of water to clear out\nhis throat from the first coughing fit.",
      "Harry hadn't realized, not until just now. Of course it\nwas obvious the instant Professor Quirrell said it. Right,\nProfessor McGonagall had even told him not to talk to\nsnakes where anyone could see him, but he'd thought she'd meant not\nto be seen talking to any statues or architectural features in\nHogwarts that looked like snakes. Double illusion of transparency,\nhe'd thought he understood her, she'd thought he understood her -\nbut how the hell -",
      "\"So,\" Harry said, \"you performed Legilimency on me during my\nfirst Defense class, to find out what happened with the Sorting Hat\n-\"",
      "\"Then I would not have found out in December.\" Professor Quirell\nleaned back, smiling. \"This is not a puzzle you can solve on your\nown, Mr. Potter, so I will reveal the answer. Over the winter\nholiday, I was alerted to the fact that the Headmaster had filed a\nrequest for a closed judicial panel to review the case of one Mr.\nRubeus Hagrid, whom you know as the Keeper of Keys and Grounds at\nHogwarts, and who was accused of the murder of Abigail Myrtle in\n1943.\"",
      "\"Oh, of course,\" said Harry, \"that makes it downright\nobvious that I'm a Parselmouth. Professor, what\nthe sweet slithering snakes -\"",
      "\"The other suspect for that murder was Slytherin's\nMonster, the legendary inhabitant of Slytherin's Chamber of\nSecrets. Which is why certain sources alerted me to the fact, and\nwhy it caught my attention sufficiently that I spent a good deal of\nbribe money to learn the details of the case. Now in point of fact,\nMr. Potter, Mr. Hagrid is innocent. Ridiculously obviously\ninnocent. He is the most blatantly innocent bystander to be\nconvicted by the magical British legal system since Grindelwald's\nConfunding of Neville Chamberlain was pinned on Amanda Knox.\nHeadmaster Dippet prompted a student puppet to accuse Mr. Hagrid\nbecause Dippet needed a scapegoat to take the blame for the death\nof Miss Myrtle, and our marvelous justice system agreed that this\nwas plausible enough to warrant Mr. Hagrid's expulsion and the\nsnapping of his wand. Our current Headmaster needs merely provide\nsome new item of evidence significant enough to reconvene the case;\nand with Dumbledore applying pressure instead of Dippet, the result\nis a foregone conclusion. Lucius Malfoy has no particular reason to\nfear Mr. Hagrid's vindication; thus Lucius Malfoy will only resist\nto the extent that he can do so costlessly in order to impose costs\non Dumbledore, and Dumbledore is clearly willing to prosecute the\ncase regardless.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell took a sip of his water. \"But I digress. The\nnew evidence that the Headmaster promises to provide is to exhibit\na previously undetected spell on the Sorting Hat, which, the\nHeadmaster asserts, he has personally determined to respond only to\nSlytherins who are also Parselmouths. The Headmaster further argues\nthat this favors the interpretation that the Chamber of Secrets was\nindeed opened in 1943, approximately the right time frame for\nHe-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, a known Parselmouth, to have attended\nHogwarts. It is a rather questionable logic, but a judicial panel\nmay rule that it swings the case far enough to bring Mr. Hagrid's\nguilt into doubt, if they can manage to keep a straight face as\nthey say it. And now we come to the key question: how did\nthe Headmaster discover this hidden spell on the Sorting Hat?\"",
      "Professor Quirrell was smiling thinly now. \"Well now, let us\nsuppose that there was a Parselmouth in this year's crop of\nstudents, a potential Heir of Slytherin. You must admit, Mr.\nPotter, that you stand out as a possibility whenever extraordinary\npeople are considered. And if I then further ask myself which new\nSlytherin would be most likely to have his mental privacy invaded\nby the Headmaster, specifically hunting the memories of his\nSorting, why, you stand out even more.\" The smile vanished. \"So you\nsee, Mr. Potter, it was not I who invaded your mind,\nthough I will not ask you to apologize. It is not your fault that\nyou believed Dumbledore's protestations of respecting your mental\nprivacy.\"",
      "\"My sincere apologies,\" Harry said, keeping his face\nexpressionless. The rigid control was a confession in its own\nright, as was the sweat beading his forehead; but he didn't think\nthe Defense Professor would take any evidence from that. Professor\nQuirrell would just think Harry was nervous at having been\ndiscovered as the Heir of Slytherin. Rather than being nervous that\nProfessor Quirrell might realize that Harry had deliberately\nbetrayed Slytherin's secret... which itself was no longer seeming\nlike such a smart move.",
      "\"So, Mr. Potter. Any progress on finding the Chamber of\nSecrets?\"",
      "No, thought Harry. But to maintain plausible\ndeniability, you needed a general policy of sometimes evading\nquestions even when you had nothing to hide... \"With respect,\nProfessor Quirrell, if I had made such progress, it is not\nquite obvious to me that I should tell you about it.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell sipped from his own waterglass again. \"Well\nthen, Mr. Potter, I shall freely tell you what I know or suspect.\nFirst, I believe the Chamber of Secrets is real, as is Slytherin's\nMonster. Miss Myrtle's death was not discovered until hours after\nher demise, even though the wards should have alerted the\nHeadmaster instantly. Therefore her murder was performed either by\nHeadmaster Dippet, which is unlikely, or by some entity which\nSalazar Slytherin keyed into his wards at a higher level than the\nHeadmaster himself. Second, I suspect that contrary to popular\nlegend, the purpose of Slytherin's Monster was not to rid\nHogwarts of Muggleborns. Unless Slytherin's Monster were powerful\nenough to defeat the Headmaster of Hogwarts and all the teachers,\nit could not triumph by force. Multiple murders in secrecy would\nresult in the school's closure, as nearly happened in 1943, or in\nthe placing of new wards. So why Slytherin's Monster, Mr. Potter?\nWhat true purpose does it serve?\"",
      "\"Ah...\" Harry dropped his gaze to his waterglass and tried to\nthink. \"To kill anyone who got into the Chamber and didn't belong\nthere -\"",
      "\"A monster powerful enough to defeat a team of wizards that had\nbroken past the best wards Salazar could place on his Chamber?\nUnlikely.\"",
      "Harry was feeling a bit pressured now. \"Well, it's called the\nChamber of Secrets, so maybe the Monster has a secret, or\nis a secret?\" For that matter, just what sort of secrets\nwere in the Chamber of Secrets in the first place? Harry hadn't\ndone a lot of research on the subject, in part because he'd gotten\nthe impression that nobody knew anything -",
      "Professor Quirrell was smiling. \"Why not just write the secret\ndown?\"",
      "\"Ahhh...\" said Harry. \"Because if the Monster spoke\nParseltongue, that would ensure that only a true descendant of\nSlytherin could hear the secret?\"",
      "\"Easy enough to key the wards on the Chamber to a phrase spoken\nin Parseltongue. Why go to the trouble of creating Slytherin's\nMonster? It cannot have been easy to create a creature with a\nlifespan of centuries. Come, Mr. Potter, it should be obvious; what\nare the secrets that can be told from one living mind to another,\nbut never written down?\"",
      "Harry saw it then, with a burst of adrenaline that started his\nheart racing, his breath coming faster. \"Oh.\"",
      "Salazar Slytherin had been very cunning indeed. Cunning enough\nto come up with a way to bypass the Interdict of Merlin.",
      "Powerful wizardries couldn't be transmitted through books or\nghosts, but if you could create a long-lived enough sentient\ncreature with a good enough memory -",
      "\"It seems very probable to me,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"that\nHe-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named began his climb to power with secrets\nobtained from Slytherin's Monster. That Salazar's lost knowledge is\nthe source of You-Know-Who's extraordinarily powerful wizardry.\nHence my interest in the Chamber of Secrets and the case of Mr.\nHagrid.\"",
      "\"I see,\" Harry said. And if he, Harry, could\nfind Salazar's Chamber of Secrets... then all of the lost knowledge\nthat Lord Voldemort had obtained would be his as well.",
      "Yes. That was just how the story should go.",
      "Add in Harry's superior intelligence and some original magical\nresearch and some Muggle rocket launchers, and the resulting fight\nwould be completely one-sided, which was exactly how Harry wanted\nit.",
      "Harry was grinning now, a very evil grin. New priority: Find\neverything in Hogwarts that looks remotely like a snake and try\nspeaking to it. Starting with everything you've already tried, only\nthis time be sure to use Parseltongue instead of English - get\nDraco to let you into the Slytherin dorms -",
      "\"Don't become too excited, Mr. Potter,\" said Professor Quirrell.\nHis own face had become expressionless, now. \"You must\ncontinue thinking. What were the Dark Lord's parting words\nto Slytherin's Monster?\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" Harry said. \"How could either of us possibly\nknow that?\"",
      "\"Visualize the scene, Mr. Potter. Let your imagination fill in\nthe details. Slytherin's Monster - probably some great serpent, so\nthat only a Parselmouth may speak to it - has finished imparting\nall of the knowledge it possesses to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. It\nconveys to him Salazar's final benediction, and warns him that the\nChamber of Secrets must now remain closed until the next descendant\nof Salazar should prove cunning enough to open it. And he who will\nbecome the Dark Lord nods, and says to it -\"",
      "\"Avada Kedavra,\" said Harry, suddenly feeling sick to his\nstomach.",
      "\"Rule Twelve,\" Professor Quirrell said quietly. \"Never leave the\nsource of your power lying around where someone else can find\nit.\"",
      "Harry's gaze dropped to the tablecloth, which had decorated\nitself in a mournful pattern of black flowers and shadows. Somehow\nthat seemed... too sad to be imagined, Slytherin's great snake had\nonly wanted to help Lord Voldemort, and Lord Voldemort had just...\nthere was something unbearably sorrowful about it, what sort of\nperson would do that to a being who'd offered them nothing\nbut friendship... \"Do you think the Dark Lord would have\n-\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Professor Quirrell said flatly. \"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\nleft quite a trail of bodies behind him, Mr. Potter; I doubt he\nwould have omitted that one. If there were any artifacts left there\nthat could be moved, the Dark Lord would have taken those with him\nas well. There might still be something worth seeing in the Chamber\nof Secrets, and to find it would prove yourself the true Heir of\nSlytherin. But do not raise your hopes too high. I suspect that all\nyou will find is the remains of Slytherin's Monster resting quietly\nin its grave.\"",
      "They sat in silence for a while.",
      "\"I could be wrong,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"In the end it is\nonly a guess. But I did wish to warn you, Mr. Potter, so that you\nwould not be too sorely disappointed.\"",
      "Harry nodded shortly.",
      "\"One might even regret your infant self's victory,\" said\nProfessor Quirrell. His smile twisted. \"If only You-Know-Who had\nlived, you might have persuaded him to teach you some of the\nknowledge that would have been your heritage, from one Heir of\nSlytherin to another.\" The smile twisted further, as though to mock\nthe obvious impossibility, even given the premise.",
      "Note to self, thought Harry, with a slight chill and an\nedge of anger, make sure to extract my heritage out of the Dark\nLord's mind, one way or another.",
      "There was another silence. Professor Quirrell was looking at\nHarry as though waiting for him to ask something.",
      "\"Well,\" said Harry, \"so long as we're on the topic, can I ask\nhow you think the whole Parselmouth business actually -\"",
      "There came a knock at the door, then. Professor Quirrell raised\na cautionary finger, then opened the door with a wave. The waitress\nentered, balancing a huge platter with their meals as though the\nwhole assembly weighed nothing (which was in fact probably the\ncase). She gave Professor Quirrell his bowl of green soup, and a\nglass of his usual Chianti; and set down before Harry a plate of\nsmall meat strips smothered in a heavy-looking sauce, plus a glass\nof his accustomed treacle soda. Then she bowed, managing to make it\nseem like sincere respect rather than perfunctory acknowledgment,\nand departed.",
      "When she was gone, Professor Quirrell held up a finger for\nsilence again, and drew his wand.",
      "And then Professor Quirrell began performing a certain series of\nincantations that Harry recognized, making him take a sharp breath.\nIt was the series and ordering that Mr. Bester had used, the full\nset of twenty-seven spells that you would perform before discussing\nanything of truly great import.",
      "If the discussion of the Chamber of Secrets hadn't\ncounted as important -",
      "When Professor Quirrell was done - he'd performed\nthirty spells, three of which Harry hadn't heard before -\nthe Defense Professor said, \"Now we shall not be interrupted for a\ntime. Can you keep a secret, Mr. Potter?\"",
      "Harry nodded.",
      "\"A serious secret, Mr. Potter,\" Professor Quirrell said. His\neyes were intent, his face grave. \"One which could potentially send\nme to Azkaban. Think about it before you reply.\"",
      "For a moment Harry didn't even see why the question should be\nhard, given his growing collection of secrets. Then -",
      "If this secret could send Professor Quirrell to Azkaban,\nthat means he's done something illegal...",
      "Harry's brain performed a few calculations. Whatever the secret,\nProfessor Quirrell did not think his illegal act would reflect\nbadly on him in Harry's eyes. There was no advantage to be gained\nfrom not hearing it. And if it did reveal something wrong\nwith Professor Quirrell, then it was very much to Harry's advantage\nto know it, even if he had promised not to tell anyone.",
      "\"I never had very much respect for authority,\" Harry said.\n\"Legal and governmental authority included. I will keep your\nsecret.\"",
      "Harry didn't bother asking whether the revelation was worth the\ndanger it would pose to Professor Quirrell. The Defense Professor\nwasn't stupid.",
      "\"Then I must test whether you are truly a descendant of\nSalazar,\" said Professor Quirrell, and stood up from his chair.\nHarry, prompted more by reflex and instinct than calculation,\nshoved himself up out of his own chair as well.",
      "There was a blur, a shift, a sudden motion.",
      "Harry aborted his panicked backward leap halfway through,\nleaving him windmilling his arms and trying not to fall over, a\nfrantic flush of adrenaline running through him.",
      "At the other end of the room swayed a snake a meter high, bright\ngreen and intricately banded in white and blue. Harry didn't know\nenough snakelore to recognize it, but he knew that 'brightly\ncolored' meant 'poisonous'.",
      "The constant sense of doom had diminished, ironically enough,\nafter the Defense Professor of Hogwarts had turned into a venomous\nsnake.",
      "Harry swallowed hard and said, \"Greetings - ah, hssss, no, ah,\ngreetingss.\"",
      "\"Sso,\" hissed the snake. \"You sspeak, I hear. I\nsspeak, you hear?\u202f\"",
      "\"Yess, I hear,\" hissed Harry. \"You are an\nAnimaguss?\u202f\"",
      "\"Obvioussly,\" hissed the snake. \"Thirty-sseven\nruless, number thirty-four: Become Animaguss. All ssensible people\ndo, if can. Thuss, very rare.\" The snake's eyes were\nflat surfaces ensconced within dark pits, sharp black pupils in\ndark gray fields. \"This iss mosst ssecure way to sspeak. You\nssee? No otherss undersstand uss.\"",
      "\"Even if they are ssnake Animagi?\u202f\"",
      "\"Not unlesss heir of Sslytherin willss.\" The snake gave\na series of short hisses which Harry's brain translated as sardonic\nlaughter. \"Sslytherin not sstupid. Ssnake Animaguss not ssame\nas Parsselmouth. Would be huge flaw in sscheme.\"",
      "Well that definitely argued that Parseltongue was\npersonal magic, not snakes being sentient beings with a learnable\nlanguage -",
      "\"I am not regisstered,\" hissed the snake. The dark pits\nof its eyes stared at Harry. \"Animaguss musst be regisstered.\nPenalty is two yearss imprissonment. Will you keep my ssecret,\nboy?\u202f\"",
      "\"Yess,\" hissed Harry. \"Would never break\npromisse.\"",
      "The snake seemed to hold still, as though in shock, and then\nbegan to sway again. \"We come here next in sseven dayss. Bring\ncloak to passs unsseen, bring hourglasss to move through time\n-\"",
      "\"You know?\u202f\" hissed Harry in shock. \"How\n-\"",
      "Again the series of short quick hisses that translated as\nsardonic laughter. \"You arrive in my firsst classs while sstill\nin other classs, sstrike down enemy with pie, two ballss of memory\n-\"",
      "\"Never mind,\" hissed Harry. \"Sstupid question,\nforgot you were ssmart.\"",
      "\"Foolissh thing to forget,\" said the snake, but the\nhiss did not seem offended.",
      "\"Hourglasss is resstricted,\" Harry said. \"Cannot\nusse until ninth hour.\"",
      "The snake twitched its head, a snakish nod. \"Many\nresstrictionss. Locked to your usse only, cannot be sstolen. Cannot\ntranssport other humanss. But ssnake carried in pouch, I ssuspect\nwill go with. Think posssible to hold hourglasss motionlesss within\nsshell, without dissturbing wardss, while you turn sshell around\nit. We will tesst in sseven dayss. Will not sspeak of planss beyond\nthiss. You ssay nothing, to no one. Give no ssign of expectancy,\nnone. Undersstand?\u202f\"",
      "Harry nodded.",
      "\"Ansswer in sspeech.\"",
      "\"Yess.\"",
      "\"Will do as I ssaid?\u202f\"",
      "\"Yess. But,\" Harry gave a wobbling rasp that was how\nhis mind had translated a hesitant 'Ahhh' into snakish, \"I do\nnot promisse to do whatever thiss iss, you have not ssaid\n-\"",
      "The snake performed a shiver that Harry's mind translated as a\nsevere glare. \"Of coursse not. Will disscusss sspecificss at\nnext meeting.\"",
      "The blur and motion reversed itself, and Professor Quirrell was\nstanding there once more. For a moment the Defense Professor\nhimself seemed to sway, as the snake had swayed, and his eyes\nseemed cold and flat; and then his shoulders straightened and he\nwas human once more.",
      "And the aura of doom had returned.",
      "Professor Quirrell's chair scooted back for him, and he sat down\nin it. \"No sense in letting this go to waste,\" Professor Quirrell\nsaid as he picked up his spoon, \"though at the moment I would much\nprefer a live mouse. One can never quite disentangle the mind from\nthe body it wears, you see...\"",
      "Harry slowly took his seat and began eating.",
      "\"So the line of Salazar did not die with You-Know-Who after\nall,\" said Professor Quirrell after a time. \"It would seem that\nrumors have already begun to spread, among our fine student body,\nthat you are Dark; I wonder what they would think, if they knew\nthat.\"",
      "\"Or if they knew that I had destroyed a Dementor,\" Harry said,\nand shrugged. \"I figure all the fuss will blow over over the next\ntime I do something interesting. Hermione is having trouble,\nthough, and I was wondering if you might have any suggestions for\nher.\"",
      "The Defense Professor ate several spoonfuls of soup in silence,\nthen; and when he spoke again, his voice was oddly flat. \"You\nreally care about that girl.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry said quietly.",
      "\"I suppose that is why she was able to bring you out of your\nDementation?\"",
      "\"More or less,\" Harry said. The statement was true in a way,\njust not exact; it was not that his Demented self had cared, but\nthat it had been confused.",
      "\"I did not have any friends like that when I was young.\" Still\nthe same emotionless voice. \"What would have become of you, I\nwonder, if you had been alone?\"",
      "Harry shivered before he could stop himself.",
      "\"You must be feeling grateful to her.\"",
      "Harry just nodded. Not quite exact, but true.",
      "\"Then here is what I might have done at your age, if there had\nbeen anyone to do it for -\""

      "Padma Patil had finished her dinner a little late, getting on\ntoward seven-thirty, and was now striding quickly out of the Great\nHall on her way to the Ravenclaw dorm and the study rooms.\nGossiping was fun and destroying Granger's reputation was more fun,\nbut it could distract from schoolwork. She'd put off a six-inch\nessay on lomillialor wood due in next morning's Herbology\nclass, and she needed to finish it tonight.",
      "It was while she was passing through a long, twisting, narrow\nstone corridor that the whisper came, sounding like it was coming\nfrom right behind her.",
      "\"Padma Patil...\"",
      "She spun around quick as lightning, her wand already snatched up\nfrom a pocket of her robes and leaping into her hands, if Harry\nPotter thought he could sneak up on and scare her that\neasily -",
      "There was no one there.",
      "Instantly Padma spun around and looked in the other direction,\nif it had been a Ventriloquism Charm -",
      "There was no one there, either.",
      "The whispering sigh came again, soft and dangerous with a slight\nhissing undertone.",
      "\"Padma Patil, Slytherin girl...\"",
      "\"Harry Potter, Slytherin boy,\" she said out loud.",
      "She'd fought Potter and his Chaos Legion a dozen times over, and\nshe knew that this was Harry Potter doing this\nsomehow...",
      "...even though the Ventriloquism Charm was only line-of-sight,\nand in the winding corridor, she could easily see all the way to\nthe nearest twist both forward and backward, and there was no one\nthere...",
      "...it didn't matter. She knew her enemy.",
      "There was a whispery chuckle, now coming from beside her, and\nshe spun around and pointed her wand at the whisper and shouted\n\"Luminos!\u202f\"",
      "The red bolt of light shot out and struck the wall, which lit\nwith a crimson glow that soon faded.",
      "She hadn't really expected it to work. Harry Potter couldn't\npossibly be invisible, not really invisible, that was\nmagic most grownups couldn't do, and she'd never believed\nnine-tenths of the stories about him.",
      "The whispery voice laughed again, now on her other side.",
      "\"Harry Potter stands on the precipice,\" whispered the voice, now\nsounding very close to her ear, \"he is wavering, but you, you are\nalready falling, Slytherin girl...\"",
      "\"The hat never called out Slytherin for my name,\nPotter!\" She backed up against the wall, so she wouldn't have to\nwatch behind herself, and raised her wand in an attack stance.",
      "Again the soft laugh. \"Harry Potter has been in the Ravenclaw\ncommon room for the last half-hour, helping Kevin Entwhistle and\nMichael Corner rehearse Potions recipes. But it matters not. I am\nhere to deliver a warning to you, Padma Patil, and if you choose to\nignore it, that is your own affair.\"",
      "\"Fine,\" she said coldly. \"Go ahead and warn me, Potter, I'm not\nafraid of you.\"",
      "\"Slytherin was a great House, once,\" said the whisper; it\nsounded sadder, now. \"Slytherin was once a House you would have\nbeen proud to choose, Padma Patil. But something turned wrong,\nsomething turned sour; do you know what went awry in Slytherin\nHouse, Padma Patil?\"",
      "\"No, and I don't care!\"",
      "\"But you should care,\" said the whisper, now sounding like it\nwas coming from just behind her head where it stood almost pressed\nagainst the wall. \"For you are still that girl whom the Sorting Hat\noffered that choice. Do you think that just choosing Ravenclaw\nmeans that you are not Pansy Parkinson, and will not ever become\nPansy Parkinson, no matter how you conduct yourself otherwise?\"",
      "Despite everything, now, small chills of fear were spreading out\nfrom her spine and running over her skin. She'd heard\nthose stories about Harry Potter too, that he was a secret\nLegilimens. But she still stood straight, and she put all the bite\nshe could into her voice when she said, \"The Slytherins went Dark\nto get power, just like you did, Potter. And I\nwon't, not ever.\"",
      "\"But you'll spread vicious rumors about an innocent girl,\"\nwhispered the voice, \"even though it will not help you attain any\nof your own ambitions, and without considering that she has\npowerful allies who might take offense. That is not the proud\nSlytherin of the old days, Padma Patil, that is not the pride of\nSalazar, that is Slytherin gone rotten, Padma Parkinson not Padma\nMalfoy...\"",
      "She was getting more creeped out than she ever had been in her\nlife, and the possibility was starting to occur to her that this\nmight really be a ghost. She hadn't ever heard that ghosts\ncould hide themselves like this, but maybe they just didn't usually\ndo it - not to mention that most ghosts weren't this\neerie, they were just dead people after all - \"Who\nare you? The Bloody Baron?\"",
      "\"When Harry Potter was bullied and beaten,\" the voice whispered,\n\"he commanded all his allies to refrain from vengeance; do you\nremember that, Padma Patil? For Harry Potter is wavering, but not\nyet lost; he is struggling, he knows himself to be in peril. But\nHermione Granger made no such request of her own allies. Harry\nPotter is angered with you now, Padma Patil, more angered than he\nwould ever be on his own behalf... and he has allies of\nhis own.\"",
      "A shudder went through her, she knew that it was visible and she\nhated herself for it.",
      "\"Oh, don't be afraid,\" breathed the voice. \"I will not hurt you.\nFor you see, Padma Patil, Hermione Granger truly is innocent.\nShe does not stand on the precipice, she is not\nfalling. She did not ask her allies to refrain from hurting you,\nbecause the thought did not even occur to her as a possibility. And\nHarry Potter knows very well that if he hurt you or caused you to\nbe hurt, for Hermione Granger's sake, then she would never speak to\nhim again until the Sun burned low and the last star failed in the\nnight sky.\" The voice was very sad now. \"She truly is a kindly\ngirl, a person such as I could only wish to be...\"",
      "\"Granger can't cast the Patronus Charm!\" said Padma. \"If she was\nreally as nice as she pretends to be -\"",
      "\"Can you cast the Patronus Charm, Padma Patil? You\ndared not even attempt it, you feared what the result would\nbe.\"",
      "\"That's not true! I didn't have time, that was\nall!\"",
      "The whisper continued. \"But Hermione Granger did try, openly\nbefore her friends, and when her magic failed she was surprised and\ndismayed. For there are secrets to the Patronus Charm that few ever\nknew, and maybe none now know but I.\" A soft, whispery chuckle.\n\"Let it stand that it is no stain of her spirit that halts her\nlight from coming forth. Hermione Granger cannot cast the Patronus\nCharm for the very same reason that Godric Gryffindor, who raised\nthese halls, never could.\"",
      "The corridor was becoming colder, she was certain of\nit, as though someone were using the Chilling Charm.",
      "\"And Harry Potter is not Hermione Granger's only ally.\" Now\nthere was an undertone of dry amusement in that whisper, it\nreminded her suddenly and frighteningly of Professor Quirrell.\n\"Filius Flitwick and Minerva McGonagall are quite fond of her, I do\nbelieve. Did it occur to you that if those two learned what you\nwere doing to Hermione Granger, they might become less fond of you?\nThey might not intervene openly, perhaps; but they might be a\nlittle slower to award you House Points, a little slower to steer\nopportunities your way -\"",
      "\"Potter snarked on me?\"",
      "A ghostly chuckle, a dry heh-heh-heh. \"Do you think those two\nare stupid, deaf and blind?\" In a sadder whisper, \"Do you think\nHermione Granger is not precious to them, that they will not see\nher hurting? As they might have been fond of you once, their bright\nyoung Padma Patil, but you are throwing it away...\"",
      "Padma's throat was dry. She hadn't thought of that, not at\nall.",
      "\"I wonder how many people will end up caring for you, Padma\nPatil, on this path that you now tread. Is it worth that much, just\nto distance yourself further from your sister? To be the shadow to\nParvati's light? Your deepest fear has always been to fall into\nharmony with her, back into harmony with her I should say;\nbut is it worth hurting an innocent girl, just to make yourself\nthat much more different? Must you be the evil twin, Padma\nPatil, can you not find a different good to pursue?\"",
      "Her heart was hammering in her chest. She'd, she'd never talked\nabout that with anyone -",
      "\"I have always wondered at how students bully each other,\"\nsighed the voice. \"How children make life difficult for themselves,\nhow they turn their schools into prisons even with their own hands.\nWhy do human beings make their own lives so unpleasant? I can give\nyou a part of the answer, Padma Patil. It is because people do not\nstop and think before causing pain, if they do not imagine that\nthey themselves could also be hurt, that they might also suffer\nfrom their own misdeeds. But suffer you will, oh, yes, Padma Patil,\nsuffer you will, if you stay on this road. You will suffer the same\npain of loneliness, the same pain of others' fear and distrust,\nthat you now inflict on Hermione Granger. Only for you it will be\ndeserved.\"",
      "Her wand was shaking in her hand.",
      "\"You did not choose sides when you went to Ravenclaw, girl. You\nchoose your side by the way you live your life, what you do to\nother people and what you do to yourself. Will you illuminate\nothers' lives, or darken them? That is the choice between Light and\nDark, not any word the Sorting Hat cries out. And the hard part,\nPadma Patil, is not saying 'Light', the hard part is deciding which\nis which, and admitting it to yourself when you begin down the\nwrong road.\"",
      "There was silence. It went on for a time, and Padma realized\nthat she had been dismissed.",
      "Padma almost dropped her wand, when she tried to put it back\ninto her pocket. She almost fell, when she took a step forward away\nfrom the wall, and turned to go -",
      "\"I have not always chosen rightly between Light and Dark,\" the\nwhisper said, now loud and harsh directly into her ear. \"Do not\ntake my wisdom as a final word, girl, do not fear to question it,\nfor though I tried I have sometimes failed, oh, yes, I have failed.\nBut you are hurting a true innocent, and you will achieve none of\nyour ambitions by doing so, it is not for any cunning plan. You are\ninflicting pain purely for the sake of the pleasure it brings you.\nI have not always chosen rightly between Light and Dark, but that I\nknow for darkness, for certain. You are hurting an innocent girl,\nand escaping retribution only because she is too kindly to tolerate\nher allies moving against you. I cannot hurt you for that, so know\nonly that I cannot respect it. You are unworthy of Slytherin; go\nand do your Herbology homework, Ravenclaw girl!\"",
      "The final whisper came out in a louder hiss that sounded almost\nlike a snake, and Padma fled, she fled down the corridors like\nLethifolds were chasing her, she ran heedless of the rules about\nrunning in the corridors, even when she passed other students who\nlooked at her in surprise, she did not stop, she ran all the way to\nthe Ravenclaw dorms with her pulse pounding in her neck, the door\nasked her \"Why does the Sun shine in the day instead of the\nnighttime?\" and it took her three tries before she could make her\nanswer coherent, and then the door came open and she saw -",
      "- a few girls and boys, some young and some old, all staring at\nher, and in one corner at the pentagonal table, Harry Potter and\nMichael Corner and Kevin Entwhistle, looking up from their\ntextbooks.",
      "\"Sweet Merlin!\" exclaimed Penelope Clearwater, rising from a\ncouch. \"What happened to you, Padma?\"",
      "\"I,\" she stuttered, \"I, I heard - a ghost -\"",
      "\"It wasn't the Bloody Baron, was it?\" said Clearwater. She drew\nher wand and a moment later she was holding a cup, and then an\nAguamenti later the cup was filled with water. \"Here,\ndrink this, sit down -\"",
      "Padma was already striding toward the pentagonal table. She\nlooked at Harry Potter, who was looking at her with his own gaze,\ncalm and grave and a little sad.",
      "\"You did this!\" Padma said. \"How - you - how dare\nyou!\"",
      "There was a sudden hush in the Ravenclaw dorm.",
      "Harry just looked at her.",
      "And said, \"Is there anything I can help you with?\"",
      "\"Don't deny it,\" Padma said, her voice shaking, \"you\nset that ghost on me, it said -\"",
      "\"I mean it,\" Harry said. \"Can I help you with anything? Get you\nsome food, or go fetch a soda for you, or help you with your\nhomework, or anything like that?\"",
      "Everyone was staring at the two of them.",
      "\"Why?\" Padma said. She couldn't think of anything else to say,\nshe didn't understand.",
      "\"Because some of us are standing on the precipice,\" Harry said.\n\"And the difference is what you do for other people. Will you let\nme help you with something, Padma, please?\"",
      "She stared at him, and knew, in that moment, that he'd gotten\nhis own warning, same as her.",
      "\"I...\" she said. \"I've got to write six inches on\nlomillialor -\"",
      "\"Let me run up to my dorm room and get my Herbology stuff,\"\nHarry said. He rose from the pentagonal table, looked at Entwhistle\nand Corner. \"Sorry, guys, I'll see you later.\"",
      "They didn't say anything, just stared, along with everyone else\nin the dorm room, as Harry Potter walked over to the stairs.",
      "And just as he started up, he said, \"And no one's to pester her\nwith questions unless she wants to talk about it, I hope\neveryone's got that?\u202f\"",
      "\"Got it,\" said most of the first years and some of the older\nstudents, a few of them sounding quite scared.",
      "And she talked about a lot of things with Harry Potter besides\nlomillialor wood - even her fear of falling back into\nharmony with Parvati, which she'd never talked about with\nanyone before, but then Harry's ghostly ally already knew.\nAnd Harry had reached into his pouch and pulled out some\nodd books, loaning them to her on condition of complete\nsecrecy, saying that if she could comprehend those books it would\nchange the pattern of her thinking enough that she'd never fall\ninto harmony with Parvati again...",
      "At nine o' clock, when Harry said he had to go, the essay was\nonly half done.",
      "And when Harry paused, and looked at her on the way out, and\nsaid that he thought she was worthy of Slytherin, it made\nher feel good for a whole minute before she realized what had just\nbeen said to her and who had said it.",
      "When Padma got down to breakfast, that morning, she saw Mandy\nsee her and whisper something to the girl sitting beside her at the\nRavenclaw table.",
      "She saw that girl get up from the bench and walk toward her.",
      "Last night Padma had been glad that girl roomed in the other\ndorm; but now that she thought about it, this was worse, now she\nhad to do it in front of everyone.",
      "But even though Padma was sweating, she knew what she had to\ndo.",
      "The girl came closer -",
      "\"I'm sorry.\"",
      "\"What?\" said Padma. That was her line.",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" repeated Hermione Granger. Her voice was loud so\nthat everyone could hear. \"I... I didn't ask Harry to do that, and\nI was angry with him when I found out, and I made him promise not\nto do it again to anyone, and I'm not talking to him for a\nweek... I'm really, really sorry, Miss Patil.\"",
      "Hermione Granger's back was stiff, her face was stiff, you could\nsee the sweat on her face.",
      "\"Um,\" said Padma. Her own thoughts were pretty much scrambled,\nnow...",
      "Padma's gaze flicked to the Ravenclaw table, where one boy was\nwatching them with tight eyes and his hands clenched in his\nlap.",
      "Earlier:",
      "\"I told you to be nicer!\u202f\" shrieked Hermione.",
      "Harry was starting to sweat. He'd never actually heard Hermione\nscream at him before, and it was quite loud in the empty\nclassroom.",
      "\"I - but - but I was nice!\" Harry protested. \"I\npractically redeemed her, Padma was going down the wrong\npath and I turned her off it! I probably changed her whole life to\nbe happier! Besides, you should've heard the original\nversion of what Professor Quirrell suggested I do -\" at which point\nHarry realized what he was saying and closed his mouth a second too\nlate.",
      "Hermione clutched at her chestnut curls, a gesture Harry hadn't\nseen from her before. \"What'd he say to do? Kill\nher?\"",
      "The Defense Professor had suggested that Harry identify all the\nkey influential students inside and outside his year and try to\ngain control of the entire Hogwarts rumor mill, remarking that this\nwas a generally useful and amusing challenge for any true Slytherin\nattending Hogwarts.",
      "\"Nothing like that,\" Harry said quickly, \"he just said\nin a general way that I should get influence over the people\nspreading rumors, and I decided that the nice\nversion of that would be to just inform Padma directly about the\nmeaning of what she was doing, and the possible consequences of her\nactions, instead of trying to threaten her or anything like that\n-\"",
      "\"You call that not threatening someone?\u202f\" Hermione's\nhands were pulling at her hair now.",
      "\"Um...\" Harry said. \"I guess she might've felt a little\nthreatened, but Hermione, people will do whatever they think they\ncan get away with, they don't care about how much it hurts other\npeople if it doesn't hurt themselves, if Padma thinks there's\nno consequences to spreading lies about you then of\ncourse she'll just go on doing it -\"",
      "\"And you think there's going to be no consequences to what\nyou did?\"",
      "Harry got a sudden sick feeling to his stomach.",
      "Hermione had the angriest look on her that he'd ever seen. \"What\ndo you think the other students think of you now, Harry? Of\nme? If Harry doesn't like the way you talk about Hermione,\nyou'll get ghosts set on you, is that what you want them to\nthink?\"",
      "Harry opened his mouth and no words came out, he just... hadn't\nthought about it that way, actually...",
      "Hermione reached down to grab her books from the table where\nshe'd slammed them. \"I'm not talking to you for a week, and I'll\ntell everyone I'm not talking to you for a week, and I'll\ntell them why, and maybe that'll undo some of\nwhat you just did. And after that week, I'll - I'll decide then\nwhat to do, I guess -\"",
      "\"Hermione!\u202f\" Harry's own voice rose to a shriek of\ndesperation. \"I was trying to help!\u202f\"",
      "The girl turned back and looked at him as she opened the\nclassroom door.",
      "\"Harry,\" she said, and her voice trembled a little beneath the\nanger, \"Professor Quirrell is sucking you into the darkness, he\nreally is, I mean it, Harry.\"",
      "\"This... wasn't him, this wasn't what he said to do, this was\njust me -\"",
      "Hermione's voice was almost a whisper now. \"Someday you're going\nto go out to lunch with him, and it will be your dark side that\ncomes back, or maybe even you won't come back at all.\"",
      "\"I promise you,\" Harry said, \"that I will come back\nfrom lunch.\"",
      "He wasn't even thinking as he said it.",
      "And Hermione just turned around and strode out and slammed the\ndoor behind her.",
      "Way to invoke the laws of dramatic irony, moron,\nobserved Harry's Internal Critic. Now you're going to die this\nSaturday, your last words will be 'I'm sorry, Hermione', and she'll\nalways regret that the last thing she did was slam the door\n-",
      "Oh, shut up.",
      "When Padma sat down with Hermione for breakfast, and said in a\nvoice loud enough for others to hear that the ghost had just told\nher things that were important for her to hear, and Harry Potter\nhad been right to do it, there were some people who were less\nfrightened afterward, and some who were frightened more.",
      "And afterward people did say fewer nasty things about\nHermione, at least in the first year, at least in public where\nHarry Potter might hear about it.",
      "When Professor Flitwick asked Harry if he was responsible for\nwhat had happened to Padma, and Harry said yes, Professor Flitwick\ntold him that he was to serve two days' detention. Even if it had\nonly been a ghost and Padma hadn't been hurt, still, that wasn't\nacceptable behavior for a Ravenclaw student. Harry nodded and said\nthat he understood why the Professor had to do that, and wouldn't\nprotest; but considering that it did seem to have turned\nPadma around, did Professor Flitwick really think, off the record,\nthat he'd done the wrong thing? And Professor Flitwick paused,\nseeming to actually think about it, and then said to Harry, in a\nsolemnly squeaky voice, that he needed to learn how to relate to\nother students the normal way.",
      "And Harry couldn't help but think that this was advice that\nProfessor Quirrell would never give him.",
      "Harry couldn't help but think that if he'd done it Professor\nQuirrell's way, the normal Slytherin way, a mixture of\npositive and negative incentives to bring Padma and the other\nrumor-mongers under his explicit control, then Padma wouldn't have\ntalked about it, and Hermione would have never found out...",
      "...in which case Padma wouldn't have been redeemed, she would\nhave stayed on the wrong path, and she herself would have suffered\nfrom that eventually. It wasn't as if Harry had lied to\nPadma in any way, when he was Time-Turned and invisible and using\nthe Ventriloquism Charm.",
      "Harry still wasn't sure whether he'd done the right thing, or\na right thing, and Hermione hadn't relented on not talking\nto him - though she was talking a lot with Padma. It hurt more than\nHarry had expected, going back to studying by himself; like his\nbrain had already started to forget its long-honed skill of being\nalone.",
      "The days until Saturday's lunch with Professor Quirrell seemed\nto go by very, very slowly."

      "Saturday.",
      "Harry had run into trouble falling asleep Friday night, which he\nhad anticipated might happen, and so he had decided to take the\nobvious advance precaution of buying a sleeping potion; and to\nprevent it from constituting a visible sign that he was nervous, he\nhad decided to buy it off Fred and George a couple of months\nearlier. (Be prepared, that's the Boy Scout's marching\nsong...)",
      "Thus Harry was fully rested, and his pouch contained almost\neverything which he owned and might conceivably need. Harry had, in\nfact, run into the volume limitation on the pouch; and keeping in\nmind that he would need to store a large snake, and might need to\nstore who-knew-what-else, he had removed some of the bulkier items,\nlike the car battery. He was up to the point now where he could\nTransfigure something the size of a car battery in four minutes\nflat, so it wasn't much of a loss.",
      "Harry had kept the emergency flares and the\noxyacetylene welding torch and fuel tank, since you couldn't just\nTransfigure things that were to be burned.",
      "(Be prepared, as through life you march along...)",
      "Mary's Place.",
      "After the waitress had taken their order and bowed to them and\nleft the room, Professor Quirrell had performed only four Charms,\nand then they'd talked about nothing of any vast consequence, just\nProfessor Quirrell's complex thesis about how the Dark Lord's curse\non the Defense position had led to the decline of dueling and how\nthis had changed social customs in magical Britain. Harry listened\nand nodded and said intelligent things, while he tried to control\nthe pounding of his heart.",
      "Then the waitress came in again bearing their food, and this\ntime, a minute after the waitress had departed, Professor Quirrell\ngestured for the door to close and lock, and began to speak\ntwenty-nine security Charms, one of the ones in Mr. Bester's\nsequence being left out this time, which somewhat puzzled\nHarry.",
      "Professor Quirrell finished his Charms -",
      "- stood up from his chair -",
      "- blurred into a green snake, banded in blue and white -",
      "- hissed, \"Hungry, boy? Eat your fill sswiftly, we sshall\nneed both sstrength and time.\"",
      "Harry's eyes were a bit wide, but he hissed, \"I ate well at\nbreakfasst,\" and then rapidly began forking noodles into his\nmouth.",
      "The snake watched him for a moment, with those flat eyes, and\nthen hissed, \"Do not wissh to explain here. Prefer to be\nelssewhere firsst. Need to leave unobsserved, without ssign we have\never departed room.\"",
      "\"Sso no one can track uss,\" hissed Harry.",
      "\"Yess. Do you trusst me that much, boy? Think before\nansswer. I will have important requesst of you, which requiress\ntrusst; if ssay no regardlesss, then ssay no now.\"",
      "Harry dropped his gaze from the snake's flat eyes, and looked\nback down at his sauce-coated noodles, and ate another bite, then\nanother, while he thought.",
      "The Defense Professor... was an ambiguous figure, to put it\nmildly; Harry thought he had unraveled some of his goals, but\nothers remained mysterious.",
      "But Professor Quirrell had knocked down two hundred girls to\nstop the ones summoning Harry. Professor Quirrell had deduced that\nthe Dementor was draining Harry through his wand. The Defense\nProfessor had saved Harry's life, twice, in a two-week period.",
      "Which could mean that the Defense Professor was just saving\nHarry for later, that there were ulterior motives. Indeed,\nit was certain that there were ulterior motives. Professor\nQuirrell wasn't doing this on a whim. But then Professor Quirrell\nhad also seen Harry taught Occlumency, he had taught Harry how to\nlose... if the Defense Professor wanted to make some use of Harry\nPotter, it was a use that required a strengthened Harry Potter, not\na weakened one. That was what it meant to be used by a friend, that\nthey would want the use to make you stronger instead of weaker.",
      "And if there was sometimes a cold atmosphere about the Defense\nProfessor, bitterness in his voice or emptiness in his gaze, then\nHarry was the only one who Professor Quirrell allowed to see\nit.",
      "Harry didn't quite know how to describe in words the sense of\nkinship he felt with Professor Quirrell, except to say that the\nDefense Professor was the only clear-thinking person Harry\nhad met in the wizarding world. Sooner or later everyone else\nstarted playing Quidditch, or not putting protective shells on\ntheir time machines, or thinking that Death was their friend. It\ndidn't matter how good their intentions were. Sooner or later, and\nusually sooner, they demonstrated that something deep inside their\nbrain was confused. Everyone except Professor Quirrell. It was a\nbond that went beyond anything of debts owed, or even anything of\npersonal liking, that the two of them were alone in the wizarding\nworld. And if the Defense Professor occasionally seemed a little\nscary or a little Dark, well, that was just the same thing some\npeople said about Harry.",
      "\"I trusst you,\" hissed Harry.",
      "And the snake explained the first stage of the plan.",
      "Harry took a final forkful of noodles, chewed. Beside him,\nProfessor Quirrell, now in human form again, was eating his soup\nplacidly, as though nothing of special interest were occurring.",
      "Then Harry swallowed, and in the same moment stood up from his\nchair, already feeling his heart start to hammer hard in his chest.\nThe security precautions they were taking were literally the most\nstringent possible...",
      "\"Are you ready to test it, Mr. Potter?\" Professor Quirrell said\ncalmly.",
      "It wasn't a test, but Professor Quirrell wouldn't say\nthat, not out loud in human speech, even in this room screened to\nthe limit that Professor Quirrell had secured with further\nCharms.",
      "\"Yep,\" Harry said as casually as he could.",
      "Step one.",
      "Harry said \"Cloak\" to his pouch, drew forth the Cloak of\nInvisibility, and then unstuck the pouch from his belt and threw it\ntoward the other side of the table.",
      "The Defense Professor stood up from his own seat, drew his wand,\nbent down, and touched his wand to the pouch, murmuring a quiet\nincantation. The new enchantments would ensure that Professor\nQuirrell could enter the pouch on his own in snakeform, and leave\nit on his own, and hear what went on outside while he was in the\npouch.",
      "Step two.",
      "As Professor Quirrell stood up from where he'd bent over by the\npouch, and put away his wand, his wand happened to point in Harry's\ndirection, and there was a brief crawling sensation on Harry's\nchest near where the Time-Turner lay, like something creepy had\npassed very close by without touching him.",
      "Step three.",
      "The Defense Professor turned into a snake again, and the sense\nof doom diminished; the snake crawled to the pouch and into it, the\npouch's mouth opening to admit the green shape, and as the mouth\nclosed again behind the tail, the sense of doom diminished\nfurther.",
      "Step four.",
      "Harry drew his wand, being careful to stand still as he did it,\nso that the Time-Turner would not move from where Professor\nQuirrell had anchored the hourglass within the shell in its current\norientation. \"Wingardium Leviosa,\" murmured Harry, and the\npouch began to float toward him.",
      "Slowly, slowly, as Professor Quirrell had instructed, the pouch\nbegan to float toward Harry, who waited alert for any sign the\npouch was opening, in which case Harry was to use the Hover Charm\nto propel it away from him as fast as possible.",
      "As the pouch came within a meter of Harry, the sense of doom\nreturned.",
      "As Harry reattached the pouch to his belt, the sense of doom was\nstronger than it had ever been, but still not overwhelming; it was\ntolerable.",
      "Even with Professor Quirrell's Animagus form lying within the\nextended space of the pouch resting on Harry's very hip.",
      "Step five.",
      "Harry sheathed his wand. His other hand still held the Cloak of\nInvisibility, and Harry drew that cloak over himself.",
      "Step six.",
      "And so in that room shielded from every possible scrying, which\nProfessor Quirrell had personally and further secured, it was not\nuntil after Harry was wearing the true Cloak of\nInvisibility that he reached beneath his shirt and twisted the\nouter shell of the Time-Turner just once.",
      "The Time-Turner's inner hourglass stayed anchored and\nmotionless, the setting twisted around it -",
      "The food vanished from the table, the chairs leaped back into\nplace, the door sprang open.",
      "Mary's Room was deserted, as it should have been, because\nProfessor Quirrell had earlier contacted Mary's Place under a false\nname to inquire whether the room would be available at this hour -\nnot to reserve it, not to place a canceled reservation that might\nbe noted, but only to inquire.",
      "Step seven.",
      "Staying under the Cloak of Invisibility, Harry left through the\nopen door. He navigated the tiled hallways of Mary's Place to the\nwell-stocked bar that greeted new entrants, tended by the owner,\nJake. There were only a few people at the bar, in the morning\nbefore proper lunchtime, and Harry had to wait invisibly by the\ndoor for several minutes, listening to the murmur of conversation\nand the gurgle of alcohol, before the door opened to admit a huge\ngenial Irishman, and Harry slipped out silently in his wake.",
      "Step eight.",
      "Harry walked for a while. He was well away from Mary's Place\nwhen he turned off Diagon Alley into a smaller alley, at the end of\nwhich lay a shop that was dark, the windows enchanted to\nblackness.",
      "Step nine.",
      "\"Sword fish melon friend,\" Harry spoke the passphrase to the\nlock, and it clicked open.",
      "Within the shop was also darkness, the light from the open door\nbriefly illuminating it to show a wide, empty room. The furniture\nshop which had once operated here had gone bankrupt a few months\nago, according to the Defense Professor, and the shop had been\nrepossessed, but not yet resold. The walls were painted a simple\nwhite, the wooden floor scratched and unpolished, a single closed\ndoor set in the back wall; this had been a showroom, once, but now\nit showed nothing.",
      "The door clicked shut behind Harry, and then the darkness was\npitch and complete.",
      "Step ten.",
      "Harry took out his wand and said \"Lumos\", lighting the\nroom with white glow; he took his pouch from his belt (the sense of\ndoom growing a little sharper as he grasped it with his fingers)\nand lightly tossed it to the opposite side of the room (the sense\nof doom fading almost completely). And then he began to take off\nthe Cloak of Invisibility, even as his voice hissed, \"It iss\ndone.\"",
      "Step eleven.",
      "From the pouch poked a green head, followed shortly by a\nmeter-long green body as the snake slithered out. A moment later,\nthe snake blurred into Professor Quirrell.",
      "Step twelve.",
      "Harry waited in silence while the Defense Professor recited\nthirty Charms.",
      "\"All right,\" Professor Quirrell said calmly, when he had\nfinished. \"If anyone is still watching us now, we are in any case\ndoomed, so I will speak plainly and in human form. Parseltongue\ndoes not quite suit me, I fear, as I am neither a descendant of\nSalazar nor a true snake.\"",
      "Harry nodded.",
      "\"So, Mr. Potter,\" said Professor Quirrell. His gaze intent, his\npale blue eyes dark and shadowed in the white light coming from\nHarry's wand. \"We are alone and unobserved, and I have an important\nquestion to ask you.\"",
      "\"Go ahead,\" said Harry, his heart starting to beat faster.",
      "\"What is your opinion of the government of magical Britain?\"",
      "That wasn't quite what Harry had been expecting, but it was\nclose enough, so Harry said, \"Based on my limited knowledge, I\nwould say that both the Ministry and the Wizengamot appear to be\nstupid, corrupt, and evil.\"",
      "\"Correct,\" Professor Quirrell said. \"Do you understand why I\nask?\"",
      "Harry took a deep breath, and looked Professor Quirrell straight\nin the eyes, unflinching. Harry had finally worked out that the way\nto make amazing deductions from scanty evidence was to know the\nanswer in advance, and he had guessed this answer fully a week ago.\nIt needed only a slight adjustment...",
      "\"You are about to invite me to join a secret organization full\nof interesting people like yourself,\" said Harry, \"one of whose\ngoals is to reform or overthrow the government of magical Britain,\nand yes, I'm in.\"",
      "There was a slight pause.",
      "\"I'm afraid that is not quite where I intended to direct this\nconversation,\" said Professor Quirrell. The corners of his lips\nwere twitching slightly. \"I merely planned to ask for your help in\ndoing something extremely treasonous and illegal.\"",
      "Darn, thought Harry. Still, Professor Quirrell hadn't\ndenied it... \"Go on.\"",
      "\"Before I do,\" said Professor Quirrell. There was no levity in\nhis voice, now. \"Are you open to such requests, Mr.\nPotter? I say again that if you are likely to say no regardless,\nyou must say no now. If your curiosity impels you otherwise, squash\nit.\"",
      "\"Treasonous and illegal doesn't bother me,\" said Harry. \"Risks\nbother me and the stakes would need to be commensurate, but I can't\nimagine you taking risks frivolously.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell nodded. \"I would not. It is a terrible abuse\nof my friendship with you, and of such trust as is placed in my\nteaching position at Hogwarts -\"",
      "\"You can skip this part,\" Harry said.",
      "The lips twitched again, and then went flat. \"Then I shall skip\nit. Mr. Potter, you sometimes make a game of lying with truths,\nplaying with words to conceal your meanings in plain sight. I, too,\nhave been known to find that amusing. But if I so much as\ntell you what I hope we shall do this day, Mr. Potter, you\nwill lie about it. You will lie straight out, without\nhesitation, without wordplay or hints, to anyone who asks about it,\nbe they foe or closest friend. You will lie to Malfoy, to Granger,\nand to McGonagall. You will speak, always and without hesitation,\nin exactly the fashion you would speak if you knew\nnothing, with no concern for your honor. That also is how it must\nbe.\"",
      "There was silence, then, for a time.",
      "That was a price measured in a fraction of Harry's soul.",
      "\"Without telling me yet...\" said Harry. \"Can you say if the need\nis desperate?\"",
      "\"There is someone in the most terrible want of your help,\"\nProfessor Quirrell said simply, \"and there is no one who can help\nthem but you.\"",
      "There was another silence, but not a long one.",
      "\"All right,\" Harry said quietly. \"Tell me of the mission.\"",
      "The dark robes of the Defense Professor seemed to blur against\nthe shadow on the wall, cast by his silhouette blocking the white\nlight of Harry's wand. \"The ordinary Patronus Charm, Mr. Potter,\nwards off a Dementor's fear. But the Dementors still see you\nthrough it, they know that you are there. Only not your Patronus\nCharm. It blinds them, or more than blinds them. What I saw beneath\nthe cloak wasn't even looking in our direction as you killed it; as\nthough it had forgotten our existence, even as it died.\"",
      "Harry nodded. That wasn't surprising, not when you confronted a\nDementor on the level of its true existence, beyond\nanthropomorphism. Death might be the last enemy, but it wasn't a\nsentient enemy. When humanity had wiped out smallpox, smallpox\nhadn't fought back.",
      "\"Mr. Potter, the central branch of Gringotts is guarded by every\nspell high and low that the goblins know. Even so those vaults have\nbeen successfully robbed; for what wizardry can do, wizardry can\nundo. And yet no one has ever escaped from Azkaban. No one. For\nevery Charm there is a counter-Charm, for every ward there is a\nbypass. How can it be that no one has ever been rescued from\nAzkaban?\"",
      "\"Because Azkaban has something invincible,\" Harry said.\n\"Something so terrible that no one can defeat it.\"",
      "That was the keystone of their perfect security, it had to be,\nnothing human. It was Death that guarded Azkaban.",
      "\"The Dementors don't like their meals being taken away from\nthem,\" Professor Quirrell said. Coldness had entered that voice,\nnow. \"They know if anyone tries. There are more than a hundred\nDementors there, and they speak to the guards as well. It's that\nsimple, Mr. Potter. If you're a powerful wizard then Azkaban isn't\nhard to enter, and it isn't hard to leave. So long as you don't try\nto take anything out of it that belongs to the Dementors.\"",
      "\"But the Dementors are not invincible,\" said Harry. He\ncould have cast the Patronus Charm with that thought, in that very\nmoment. \"Never believe that they are.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell's voice was very quiet. \"Do you remember what\nit was like when you went before the Dementor, the first time, when\nyou failed?\"",
      "\"I remember.\"",
      "And then with a sudden sickening lurch in his stomach, Harry\nknew where this was going; he should have seen it before.",
      "\"There is an innocent person in Azkaban,\" Professor Quirrell\nsaid.",
      "Harry nodded, there was a burning sensation in his throat, but\nhe didn't cry.",
      "\"The one of whom I speak was not under the Imperius Curse,\" said\nthe Defense Professor, dark robes silhouetted against a greater\nshadow. \"There are surer ways to break wills than the Imperius, if\nyou have the time for torture, and Legilimency, and rituals of\nwhich I will not speak. I cannot tell you how I know this, how I\nknow any of this, cannot hint at it even to you, you will have to\ntrust me. But there is a person in Azkaban who never once chose to\nserve the Dark Lord, who has spent years suffering alone in the\nmost terrible cold and darkness imaginable, and never deserved a\nsingle minute of it.\"",
      "Harry saw it in a single leap of intuition, his mouth racing\nalmost ahead of his thoughts.",
      "There was no hint, no warning, we all thought -",
      "\"A person by the name of Black,\" Harry said.",
      "There was silence. Silence, while the pale blue eyes stared at\nhim.",
      "\"Well,\" said Professor Quirrell after a while. \"So much for not\ntelling you the name until after you had accepted the mission. I\nwould ask whether you're reading my mind, but that's\nflatly impossible.\"",
      "Harry said nothing, but it was simple enough if you\nbelieved in the processes of modern democracy. The most\nobvious person in Azkaban to be innocent was the one who hadn't\ngotten a trial -",
      "\"I am certainly impressed, Mr. Potter,\" said Professor\nQuirrell. His face was grave. \"But this is a serious matter, and if\nthere is some way others could make the same deduction, I\nmust know. So tell me, Mr. Potter. How in the name of\nMerlin, of Atlantis, and the void between the stars, did you guess\nthat I was talking about Bellatrix?\""

      "The adrenaline was already flowing in Harry's veins, his heart\nalready hammering in his chest, there in that darkened and bankrupt\nstore. Professor Quirrell had finished explaining, and in one hand,\nHarry held a tiny wooden twig that would be the key. This was it,\nthis was the day and the moment when Harry started acting the part.\nHis first true adventure, a dungeon to be pierced, an evil\ngovernment to be defied, a maiden in distress to be rescued. Harry\nshould have been more frightened, more reluctant, but instead he\nfelt only that it was time and past time to start becoming the\npeople he had read about in his books; to begin his journey toward\nwhat he had always known he was meant to be, a hero. To take the\nfirst step on the road that led to Kimball Kinnison and Captain\nPicard and Liono of Thundera and definitely not Raistlin\nMajere. So far as Harry's brain knew from watching early morning\ncartoons, when you grew up you were supposed to gain amazing powers\nand save the universe, that was what Harry's brain had seen adults\ndoing and adopted as its role model for the maturation process, and\nHarry very much wanted to start growing up.",
      "And if the pattern of the story called for the hero to lose some\npart of his innocence, as the result of his first adventure; then\nfor now, at least, in this still-innocent moment, it seemed time\nand past time for him to experience that pain. Like casting off\nclothes too small for him; or like finally advancing to the next\nstage of the game, after being stuck for eleven years on world 3,\nlevel 2 of Super Mario Brothers.",
      "Harry had read enough novels to suspect that he wouldn't feel\nthis enthusiastic afterward, so he was enjoying it while it\nlasted.",
      "There was a popping sound as something near Harry disappeared,\nand then there was no more time for heroic brooding.",
      "Harry's hand snapped the small wooden twig.",
      "A hook yanked motionlessly at Harry's abdomen as the portkey\nactivated, feeling like a much harder pull this time than the\nsmaller transports between the Hogwarts grounds and Diagon Alley\n-",
      "- and dropped him into the middle of a huge roll of thunder\ndying away, and a lash of cold rain whipping him across the face,\nthe water coating Harry's glasses and blinding him in an instant,\nturning the world into a blur even as he began to fall toward the\nraging ocean waves far below.",
      "He had arrived high, high, high above the empty North Sea.",
      "The shock of the blasting storm almost made Harry let go of the\nbroomstick that Professor Quirrell had given him, which would not\nhave been a good idea. It took nearly a full second for Harry to\nget his wits together and bring his broomstick back up in an easy\nswoop.",
      "\"I'm here,\" said an unfamiliar voice from a patch of empty air\nabove him; low and gravelly, the voice of the sallow lanky bearded\nman Professor Quirrell had Polyjuiced into before Disillusioning\nhimself and his broomstick.",
      "\"I'm here,\" Harry said from beneath the Cloak of Invisibility.\nHe hadn't used Polyjuice himself. Wearing a different body hindered\nyour magic, and Harry might need all of his little magic about him;\nthus the plan called for Harry to stay invisible at nearly all\ntimes, instead of Polyjuicing.",
      "(Neither of them had spoken the other's name. You simply didn't\nuse your names at any point during an illegal mission, even\ninvisibly hovering over an anonymous patch of water in the North\nSea. You simply didn't. It would be stupid.)",
      "Carefully keeping a grip on the broomstick with one hand, while\nthe rain and wind howled around him, Harry raised his wand in an\nequally careful grip and Imperviused his glasses.",
      "Then, with the lenses clear, Harry looked around.",
      "He was surrounded by wind and rain, it might have been five\ndegrees Celsius if he was lucky; he'd already had a Warming Charm\ncast on himself just from being outside in February, but it wasn't\nstanding up to the driving cold droplets. Worse than snow, the rain\nsoaked into every exposed surface. The Cloak of Invisibility turned\nall of you invisible, but it didn't cover all of you, and\nthat meant it didn't protect all of you from rain. Harry's face was\nexposed to the full force of the driven water, and it was driving\nstraight into his neck and soaking down into his shirt, also the\nsleeves of his robes and the cuffs of his pants and his shoes, the\nwater took every bit of cloth as an avenue to sneak in.",
      "\"This way,\" said the Polyjuiced voice, and a spark of green\nlight lit up in front of Harry's broomstick, and then darted away\nin a direction that seemed to Harry like every other direction.",
      "Through the blinding rain, Harry followed. He lost it sometimes,\nthat small green spark, and each time he did, Harry called out, and\nthe spark would reappear in front of him a few seconds later.",
      "When Harry had caught the trick of following the spark, it\naccelerated, and Harry kicked the broomstick into high gear and\nfollowed. The rain whipped him harder, feeling like Harry imagined\nit must feel to get a faceful of shotgun pellets, but his glasses\nstayed clear and protected his eyes.",
      "It was only a few minutes later, at the broomstick's full speed,\nthat Harry caught a glimpse of a huge shadow through the rain,\ntowering far across the waters.",
      "And felt a distant, hollow echo of emptiness radiating from\nwhere Death waited, washing over Harry's mind and parting around\nit, like a wave breaking on stone. Harry knew his enemy this time,\nand his will was steel and all of the light.",
      "\"I can already feel the Dementors,\" said the gravelly voice of\nthe Polyjuiced Quirrell. \"I did not expect that, not this\nsoon.\"",
      "\"Think of the stars,\" Harry said, over a distant rumble of\nthunder. \"Don't allow any anger in you, nothing negative, just\nthink of the stars, what it feels like to forget yourself and fall\nbodilessly through space. Hold to that thought like an Occlumency\nbarrier across your entire mind. The Dementors will have some\ntrouble reaching past that.\"",
      "There was silence for a moment, then, \"Interesting.\"",
      "The green spark lifted, and Harry inclined his broomstick\nslightly upward to follow, even as it steered them into a fogbank,\na cloud hovering low on the waters.",
      "Soon they were hovering above and slightly oblique of the huge\nthree-sided metal building, as it loomed far below. The triangle of\nsteel was hollow, not solid, it was a building of three thick solid\nwalls and no center. The Aurors on guard roomed in the top level\nand southern side of the building, Professor Quirrell had said,\nprotected by their Patronus Charms. The legal entrance into Azkaban\nwas on the roof of the southwest corner of the building. Which the\ntwo of them wouldn't use, of course. Instead they would use a\ncorridor that ran directly beneath the northern corner of the\nbuilding. Professor Quirrell would go down first, and puncture a\nhole in the roof and its wards right at the northern tip, leaving\nbehind an illusion to cover the gap.",
      "The prisoners were kept in the side of the building, in levels\ncorresponding to their crimes. And at the bottom, in the uttermost\ncenter and depth of Azkaban, lay a nest of more than a hundred\nDementors. Loads of dirt were occasionally dropped in to keep up\nthe level, as the matter directly exposed to the Dementors broke\ndown into mud and nothingness...",
      "\"Wait one minute,\" said the rough voice, \"follow me at speed,\nand pass through with care.\"",
      "\"Got it,\" Harry said lowly.",
      "The spark winked out, and Harry began to count, one one\nthousand, two one thousand, three one thousand...",
      "...sixty one thousand, and Harry dived, the wind\nshrieking around him as he dived, down toward the vast metal\nstructure, down toward where he could feel the shadows of Death\nwaiting for him, draining light and radiating emptiness, as the\nmetal structure grew larger and larger. Plain and featureless\nloomed the vast grey shape, but for a single raised boxlike\nstructure in the southwest corner. The north corner was simply\nblank, Professor Quirrell's hole undetectable.",
      "Harry pulled up sharply as he approached the north corner,\ngiving himself more safety margin than he would have bothered with\nin flying classes, but not too much. As soon as he'd come to a\nhalt, he began to slowly lower his broomstick again, toward what\nlooked like the solid roof of the tip of the north corner.",
      "Descending through the illusory roof while invisible was a\nstrange experience, and then Harry found himself in a metal\ncorridor lighted with a dim orange light - which, Harry realized\nafter a startled glance, was coming from an old-fashioned mantled\ngas lamp...",
      "...for magic would fail, be drained away after a time, in the\npresence of Dementors.",
      "Harry dismounted his broom.",
      "The pull of the emptiness was stronger now, as it parted and\nflowed around Harry without touching him. They were distant but\nthey were many, the wounds in the world; Harry could have pointed\nto them with his eyes closed.",
      "\"Casst your Patronuss,\" hissed a snake from the floor,\nlooking more discolored than green in the dim orange light.",
      "The note of stress came through even in Parseltongue. Harry was\nsurprised; Professor Quirrell had said that Animagi in their\nAnimagus forms were much less vulnerable to Dementors. (For the\nsame reason the Patronuses were animals, Harry assumed.) If\nProfessor Quirrell was in this much trouble in his snake form, what\nhad been happening to him while he was in the human form that let\nhim use his magic...?",
      "Harry's wand was already rising in his hand.",
      "This would be the beginning.",
      "Even if it was only one person, just one person that he could\nsave from the darkness, even if he wasn't powerful enough yet to\nteleport all of Azkaban's prisoners to safety and burn the\ntriangular hell down to bedrock...",
      "Even so it was a start, it was a beginning, it was a down\npayment on everything that Harry meant to accomplish with his life.\nNo more waiting, no more hoping, no more mere promising, it would\nall begin here. Here and now.",
      "Harry's wand slashed down to point at where the Dementors waited\nfar below.",
      "\"Expecto Patronum!\u202f\"",
      "The glowing humanoid figure blazed up into existence. It wasn't\nthe sun-bright thing that it had been before... probably because\nHarry hadn't quite been able to stop himself from thinking about\nall the other prisoners in their cells, the ones that he\nwasn't here to save.",
      "It might be for the best, though. Harry would need to keep this\nPatronus going for a while, and it might be better if it wasn't\nquite so bright.",
      "The Patronus dimmed a little further, at that thought; and then\nfurther again, as Harry tried to put a little less of his strength\ninto it, until finally the brilliant humanoid figure was glowing\nonly slightly brighter than the brightest animal Patronus, and\nHarry felt that he could dim it no further without risking losing\nit entirely.",
      "And then, \"It iss sstable,\" Harry hissed, and began\nfeeding his broomstick into his pouch. His wand stayed in his hand,\nand a slight, sustainable flow from him replaced the slight losses\nfrom his Patronus.",
      "The snake blurred into the form of a lanky, sallow man, holding\nProfessor Quirrell's wand in one hand and a broomstick in the\nother. The lanky man staggered as he came back into existence, and\nwent to lean against the wall for a moment.",
      "\"Well done, if perhaps a trifle slow,\" murmured the gravelly\nvoice. Professor Quirrell's dryness was in it, even though it\ndidn't fit the voice, nor did the grave look on the thickly bearded\nface. \"I cannot feel them at all, now.\"",
      "A moment later, the broomstick went into the man's robes and\nvanished. Then the man's wand rose and tapped on his head, and with\na sound like a cracking eggshell he disappeared once more.",
      "Within the air blossomed a faint green spark, and Harry, still\nenshrouded in the Cloak of Invisibility, followed after.",
      "If you had been watching from outside, you would have seen\nnothing but a small green spark drifting through the air, and a\nbrilliantly silver humanoid walking after it.",
      "They went down, and down, and down, passing gas lamp after gas\nlamp, and the occasional huge metal door, descending into Azkaban\nwithin what seemed like utter silence. Professor Quirrell had set\nup some type of barrier by which he could hear what went\non nearby, but no sounds could pass outward, and no sounds could\nreach Harry.",
      "Harry hadn't quite been able to stop his mind from wondering\nwhy the silence, or stop his mind from giving the answer.\nThe answer he'd already known on some wordless level of\nanticipation that had prompted him to futilely try not to think\nabout it.",
      "Somewhere behind those huge metal doors, people were\nscreaming.",
      "The silver humanoid figure wavered, brightening and dimming,\nevery time Harry thought about it.",
      "Harry had been told to cast a Bubble-Head Charm on himself. To\nprevent himself from smelling anything.",
      "All the enthusiasm and heroism had worn off already, as Harry\nhad known it would, it hadn't taken long even by his standards, the\nprocess had completed itself the very first time they passed one of\nthose metal doors. Every metal door was locked with a huge lock, a\nlock of simple unmagical metal that wouldn't have stopped a\nfirst-year Hogwarts student - if you still had a wand, if you still\nhad your magic, which the prisoners didn't. Those metal doors were\nnot the doors of individual cells, Professor Quirrell had said,\neach one opened into a corridor in which there would be a group of\ncells. Somehow that helped a little, not thinking that each door\ncorresponded directly to a prisoner who was waiting right behind\nit. Instead there might be more than one prisoner, which\ndiminished the emotional impact; just like the study showing that\npeople contributed more when they were told that a given amount of\nmoney was required to save one child's life, than when told the\nsame total amount was needed to save eight children...",
      "Harry was finding it increasingly hard not to think about it,\nand every time he did, the light of his Patronus fluctuated.",
      "They came to the place where the passageway turned left, at the\ncorner of the triangular building. Once again there were descending\nmetal steps, another flight of stairs; once again they went\ndown.",
      "Mere murderers were not put into the lowest of cells. There was\nalways a lower place you could go, an even worse punishment to\nfear. No matter how low you had already sunk, the government of\nmagical Britain had some threat remaining against you if you did\neven worse.",
      "But Bellatrix Black had been the Death Eater who inspired more\nfear than anyone save Lord Voldemort himself, a beautiful and\ndeadly sorceress absolutely loyal to her master; she had been, if\nsuch a thing were possible, more sadistic and evil even than\nYou-Know-Who, as though she were trying to outdo her master...",
      "...that was what the world knew of her, what the world believed\nof her.",
      "But before then, Professor Quirrell had told Harry, before the\ndebut of the Dark Lord's most terrible servant, there had been a\ngirl in Slytherin who had been quiet, keeping mostly to herself,\nharming no one. Afterward there had been made-up stories told about\nher, memories changing in retrospect (Harry knew well the research\non that). But at the time, while she still attended school, the\nmost talented witch in Hogwarts had been known as a gentle girl\n(Professor Quirrell had said). Her few friends had been surprised\nwhen she'd joined the Death Eaters, and more surprised that she'd\nbeen hiding so much darkness behind that sad, wistful smile.",
      "That was who Bellatrix had once been, the most promising witch\nof her own generation, before the Dark Lord stole her and broke\nher, shattered her and reshaped her, binding her to him on a deeper\nlevel and with darker arts than any Imperius.",
      "Ten years Bellatrix had served the Dark Lord, killing who he\nbade her kill, torturing who he bade her torture.",
      "And then the Dark Lord had finally been defeated.",
      "And Bellatrix's nightmare had continued.",
      "Somewhere inside Bellatrix there might be something that was\nstill screaming, that had been screaming the whole time, something\na psychiatric Healer could bring back; or there might not be,\nProfessor Quirrell had no way of knowing. But either way, they\ncould...",
      "...they could at least get her out of Azkaban...",
      "Bellatrix Black had been put into the lowest level of\nAzkaban.",
      "Harry was having trouble not imagining what he would see when\nthey got to her cell. Bellatrix must have had almost no fear of\ndeath, in the beginning, if she was still alive at all.",
      "They descended another flight of stairs, coming that much closer\nto Death and Bellatrix, the clacking of their invisible shoes the\nonly sound that Harry could hear. Dim orange light coming from the\ngas lights, the faint green spark drifting through the air, the\nshining figure following with its silver light fluctuating from\ntime to time.",
      "After descending many times, they came in time to a corridor\nthat did not end in stairs, and a final metal door, and the green\nspark halted before it.",
      "Harry's heart had calmed a little, as they descended far into\nthe depths of Azkaban without anything happening. But now it was\nhammering his chest once more. They were at the bottom, and the\nshadows of Death were very close at hand.",
      "A soft metal click came from the lock, as Professor Quirrell\nopened the way.",
      "Harry took a deep breath and remembered everything that\nProfessor Quirrell had told him. The hard part wouldn't just be\ngetting the pretended personality right enough to fool Bellatrix\nBlack herself, the hard part would be keeping his Patronus going at\nthe same time...",
      "The green spark winked out, and a moment later a meter-high\nsnake shimmered into existence, no longer invisible.",
      "The metal door moved with a slow creaking sound as Harry pushed\non it with his invisible hand, opened it just a crack, and peered\nthrough.",
      "He saw a straight corridor that terminated in solid stone. There\nwas no light there but what crept in from Harry's Patronus. That\nwas bright enough for him to see the outer bars of the eight cells\nset into the corridor, but he couldn't see the insides; more\nimportantly, though, he didn't see anyone in the corridor\nitself.",
      "\"I ssee nothing,\" hissed Harry.",
      "The snake darted on ahead, swiftly twisting across the\nfloor.",
      "A moment later -",
      "\"Sshe iss alone,\" hissed the snake.",
      "Stay, Harry thought to his Patronus, which took up a\nposition just to one side of the door, as though guarding it; and\nthen Harry pushed the door open further, and followed within.",
      "The first cell Harry looked at contained a dessicated corpse,\nskin gone grey and mottled, flesh worn through in places to expose\nthe bone beneath, no eyes -",
      "Harry shut his eyes. He could still do that, he was still\ninvisible, he wasn't betraying anything by shutting his eyes.",
      "He'd known it already, he'd read it on page six of his\nTransfiguration book, that you stayed in Azkaban until your prison\nterm was done. If you died before it was up they kept you there\nuntil they released your corpse. If your term was for life, they\njust left the body in the cell until the cell was needed, at which\npoint they threw your body into the Dementors' pit. But it was\nstill a shock to see, that corpse had been a person who'd\njust been left there -",
      "The light in the room wavered.",
      "Steady, thought Harry in his core. It wouldn't be good\nfor Professor Quirrell if that Patronus went out from his thinking\nsad thoughts. This near to the Dementors the Defense Professor\nmight just fall dead where he stood. Steady, Harry James\nPotter-Evans-Verres, steady!",
      "With that thought, Harry opened his eyes again, there wasn't\ntime to waste.",
      "The second cell he looked at contained only a skeleton.",
      "And behind the bars of the third cell he saw Bellatrix\nBlack.",
      "Something precious and irreplaceable inside Harry withered like\ndry grass.",
      "You could tell the woman wasn't a skeleton, that her head wasn't\na skull, because the texture of skin was still different from the\ntexture of bone, no matter how white and pale she'd become, waiting\nin the dark alone. Either they weren't feeding her much, or what\nshe ate, the shadows of Death drained from her; for her eyes seemed\nshrunken below their lids, her lips looked too shriveled to close\nover her teeth. The color seemed leached out of the black clothing\nshe had worn into prison, like the Dementors had drained that too.\nThey'd been meant to be daring, those clothes, and now they lay\nloosely over a skeleton, exposing shriveled skin.",
      "I'm here to save her, I'm here to save her, I'm here to save\nher, Harry thought to himself, desperately, over and over with\nan effort like Occlumency, willing his Patronus not to go out, to\nstay and protect Bellatrix from the Dementors -",
      "In his heart, in his core, Harry held to all his pity and his\ncompassion, his will to save her from the darkness; the silver\nradiance coming in through the open door brightened, even as he\nthought it.",
      "And in another part of him, like he was just letting another\npart of his mind carry out a habit without paying much attention to\nit...",
      "A cold expression came over Harry's face, invisibly beneath the\nhood.",
      "\"Hello, my dear Bella,\" said a chill whisper. \"Did you miss\nme?\""

      "The corpse of a woman opened her eyes, and the dull sunken orbs\ngazed out at nothing.",
      "\"Mad,\" Bellatrix muttered in a cracked voice, \"It seems that\nlittle Bella is going mad...\"",
      "Professor Quirrell had instructed Harry, calmly and precisely,\nhow he was to act in Bellatrix's presence; how to form the pretense\nhe would maintain in his mind.",
      "You found it expedient, or perhaps just amusing, to make\nBellatrix fall in love with you, to bind her to your\nservice.",
      "That love would have persisted through Azkaban, Professor\nQuirrell had said, because to Bellatrix it would not be a happy\nthought.",
      "She loves you utterly, completely, with her whole being. You\ndo not return her love, but consider her useful. She knows\nthis.",
      "She was the deadliest weapon you possessed, and you called\nher your dear Bella.",
      "Harry remembered it from the night the Dark Lord killed his\nparents: the cold amusement, the contemptuous laughter, that\nhigh-pitched voice of deathly hate. It didn't seem at all difficult\nto guess what the Dark Lord would say.",
      "\"I hope you are not mad, Bella dear,\" said the chill\nwhisper. \"Mad is not useful.\"",
      "Bellatrix's eyes flickered, tried to focus on empty air.",
      "\"My... Lord... I waited for you but you did not come... I looked\nfor you but I could not find you... you are alive...\" All her words\ncame out in a low mutter, if there was emotion in it, Harry could\nnot tell.",
      "\"Sshow her your face,\" hissed the snake at Harry's\nfeet.",
      "Harry cast back the hood of the Cloak of Invisibility.",
      "The part of him that Harry had placed in control of his facial\nexpressions looked at Bella without the slightest trace of pity,\nonly cool, calm interest. (While in his core, Harry thought, I\nwill save you, I will save you no matter what...)",
      "\"The scar...\" muttered Bellatrix. \"That child...\"",
      "\"So they all still think,\" said Harry's voice, and gave a thin\nlittle chuckle. \"You looked for me in the wrong place, Bella\ndear.\"",
      "(Harry had asked why Professor Quirrell couldn't be the one to\nplay the part of the Dark Lord, and Professor Quirrell had pointed\nout that there was no plausible reason for him to be\npossessed by the shade of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.)",
      "Bellatrix's eyes remained fixed on Harry, she said no word.",
      "\"Ssay ssomething in Parsseltongue,\" hissed the\nsnake.",
      "Harry's face turned to the snake, to make it clear that he was\naddressing it, and hissed, \"One two three four five ssix sseven\neight nine ten.\"",
      "There was a pause.",
      "\"Those who do not fear the darkness...\" murmured Bellatrix.",
      "The snake hissed, \"Will be conssumed by it.\"",
      "\"Will be consumed by it,\" whispered the chill voice. Harry\ndidn't particularly want to think about how Professor Quirrell had\ngotten that password. His brain, which thought about it anyway,\nsuggested that it had probably involved a Death Eater, a quiet\nisolated place, and some lead-pipe Legilimency.",
      "\"Your wand,\" murmured Bellatrix, \"I took it from the Potters'\nhouse and hid it, my lord... under the tombstone to the right of\nyour father's grave... will you kill me, now, if that was all you\nwished of me... I think I must have always wanted you to be the one\nto kill me... but I can't remember now, it must have been a happy\nthought...\"",
      "Harry's heart wrenched inside him, it was unbearable, and - and\nhe couldn't cry, couldn't let his Patronus fade -",
      "Harry's face showed a flicker of annoyance, and his voice was\nsharp as it said, \"Enough foolishness. You're to come with me,\nBella dear, unless you prefer the company of the Dementors.\"",
      "Bellatrix's face twitched in brief puzzlement, the shrunken\nlimbs did not stir.",
      "\"You'll need to float her out,\" Harry hissed to the\nsnake. \"Sshe can no longer think of\nesscaping.\"",
      "\"Yess,\" hissed the snake, \"but do not\nunderesstimate her, sshe wass the deadliesst of warriorss.\"\nThe green head dipped in warning. \"One would be wisse to fear\nme, boy, even were I sstarved and nine-tenthss dead; be wary of\nher, allow no ssingle flaw in your pretensse.\"",
      "The green snake smoothly glided out of the door.",
      "And shortly after, a man with sallow skin and a fearful\nexpression on his bearded face cringed into the room with his wand\nin hand.",
      "\"My Lord?\" the servant said falteringly.",
      "\"Do as you were instructed,\" the Dark Lord whispered in that\nchill voice, sounding even more terrible coming from a child's\nbody. \"And do not let your Patronus falter. Remember, if I do not\nreturn there will be no reward for you, and it will be long before\nyour family is allowed to die.\"",
      "Having spoken those dreadful words, the Dark Lord pulled his\ninvisibility cloak over his head, and disappeared.",
      "The cringing servant opened the door to Bellatrix's cage, and\npulled a tiny needle from his robes with which he poked the human\nskeleton. The single drop of red blood produced was soon absorbed\ninto a small doll, which was laid upon the floor, and the servant\nbegan to chant in a whisper.",
      "Soon another living skeleton lay upon the floor, motionless.\nAfterward the servant seemed to hesitate for a moment, until from\nthe empty air hissed an impatient command. Then the servant pointed\nhis wand at Bellatrix and spoke a word, and the living skeleton\nlying on the bed was naked, and the skeleton lying on the floor was\nclothed in her faded dress.",
      "The servant tore a small strip of cloth from the dress, as it\nlay upon the seeming corpse; and from his own robes, the fearful\nman then produced an empty glass flask with small traces of golden\nfluid clinging to its inside. This flask was concealed in a corner,\nthe strip of skirt laid over it, the leached cloth nearly blending\nwith the gray metal wall.",
      "Another wave of the servant's wand floated the human skeleton\nlying on the bed into the air, and in almost the same motion\nclothed her in new black robes. An ordinary-looking bottle of\nchocolate milk was put into her hand, and a chill whisper ordered\nBellatrix to grasp the bottle and begin drinking it, which she did,\nher face still looking only puzzled.",
      "Then the servant turned Bellatrix invisible, and turned himself\ninvisible, and they left. The door closed behind them all and\nclicked as it locked, plunging the corridor into darkness once\nmore, unchanged but for a small flask concealed in the corner of\none cell, and a fresh corpse lying upon its floor.",
      "Earlier, in the deserted shop, Professor Quirrell had told Harry\nthat they were going to commit the perfect crime.",
      "Harry had unthinkingly started to repeat back the standard\nproverb that there was no such thing as a perfect crime, before he\nactually thought about it for two-thirds of a second, remembered a\nwiser proverb, and shut his mouth in midsentence.",
      "What do you think you know, and how do you think you know\nit?",
      "If you did commit the perfect crime, nobody would ever\nfind out - so how could anyone possibly know that there\nweren't perfect crimes?",
      "And as soon as you looked at it that way, you realized that\nperfect crimes probably got committed all the time, and\nthe coroner marked it down as death by natural causes, or the\nnewspaper reported that the shop had never been very profitable and\nhad finally gone out of business...",
      "When Bellatrix Black's corpse was found dead in her cell the\nnext morning, there within the prison of Azkaban from which\n(everyone knew) no one had ever escaped, nobody bothered doing an\nautopsy. Nobody thought twice about it. They just locked up the\ncorridor and left, and the Daily Prophet reported it in\nthe obituary column the next day...",
      "...that was the perfect crime which Professor Quirrell had\nplanned.",
      "And it wasn't Professor Quirrell who screwed it up."

      "A faint green spark moved forward to set the pace, and behind it\nfollowed a brilliant silver figure, all other entities invisible.\nThey had traversed five legs of corridor, turned right five times\nand gone up five flights of stairs; and when Bellatrix had finished\nher second bottle of chocolate milk, she had been given solid bars\nof chocolate to eat.",
      "It was after her third bar of chocolate that strange noises\nbegan to come from Bellatrix's throat.",
      "It took a moment for Harry to understand, to process the sounds,\nit didn't sound like anything he'd ever heard before; the rhythm of\nit was shattered, almost unrecognizable, it took him that long to\nrealize that Bellatrix was crying.",
      "Bellatrix Black was crying, the Dark Lord's most terrible weapon\nwas crying, she was invisible but you could hear it, tiny pathetic\nsounds she was trying to suppress, even now.",
      "\"It's real?\" said Bellatrix. Tonality had returned into her\nvoice, no longer a dead mutter, it rose up at the end to form the\nquestion. \"It's real?\"",
      "Yes, thought the part of Harry simulating the Dark\nLord, now be silent -",
      "He couldn't make those words pass his lips, he just\ncouldn't.",
      "\"I knew - you would - come to me - someday,\" Bellatrix's voice\nquavered and fractured as she drew breath for quiet sobs, \"I knew -\nyou were alive - that you would come - to me - my Lord...\" there\nwas a long inhalation like a huge gasp, \"and that even - when you\ncame - you still wouldn't love me - never - you would never love me\nback - that was why - they couldn't take - my love from me - even\nthough I can't remember - can't remember so many other things -\nthough I don't know what I forgot - but I remember how much I love\nyou, Lord -\"",
      "There was a knife stabbing through Harry's heart, he'd never\nheard anything so terrible, he wanted to hunt down the Dark Lord\nand kill him just for this...",
      "\"Do you still - have use for me - my Lord?\"",
      "\"No,\" hissed Harry's voice, without him even thinking, it just\nseemed to be operating on automatic, \"I entered Azkaban on a whim.\nOf course I have use for you! Don't ask foolish questions.\"",
      "\"But - I'm weak,\" said Bellatrix's voice, and a full sob escaped\nher, it sounded much too loud in the corridors of Azkaban, \"I can't\nkill for you, my Lord, I'm sorry, they ate it all, ate me all up,\nI'm too weak to fight, what good am I to you now -\"",
      "Harry's brain cast about desperately for some way to reassure\nher, from the lips of a Dark Lord who would never speak a single\nword of caring.",
      "\"Ugly,\" said Bellatrix. Her voice said that word like it was the\nfinal nail in her coffin, the last despair. \"I'm ugly, they ate\nthat too, I'm, I'm not pretty any more, you won't even, be able, to\nuse me, as a reward, for your servants - even the Lestranges, won't\nwant, to hurt me, any more -\"",
      "The brilliant silver figure stopped walking.",
      "Because Harry had stopped walking.",
      "The Dark Lord, he... The part of Harry's self that was\nsoft and vulnerable was screaming in disbelieving horror, trying to\nreject reality, refuse the understanding, even as a colder and\nharder part completed the pattern: She obeyed him in that as\nshe obeyed him in all things.",
      "The green spark bobbed urgently, darted forward.",
      "The silver humanoid stayed in place.",
      "Bellatrix was sobbing harder.",
      "\"I'm, I'm not, I can't be, useful, any more...\"",
      "Giant hands were squeezing Harry's chest, wringing him like a\nwashcloth, trying to crush his heart.",
      "\"Please,\" whispered Bellatrix, \"just kill me...\" Her voice\nseemed to calm, once she said that. \"Please Lord, kill me, I've no\nreason to live if I'm no use to you... I only want it to stop...\nplease hurt me one last time, my Lord, hurt me until I stop... I\nlove you...\"",
      "It was the saddest thing Harry had ever heard.",
      "The bright silver shape of Harry's Patronus flickered -",
      "Wavered -",
      "Brightened -",
      "The fury that was rising in Harry, his rage against the Dark\nLord who had done this, the rage against the Dementors, against\nAzkaban, against the world that allowed such horror, it all seemed\nto be pouring straight through his arm and into his wand without\nthere being any way of blocking it, he tried willing it to stop and\nnothing happened.",
      "\"My Lord!\" whispered the disguised voice of Professor Quirrell.\n\"My spell is going out of control! Help me, my Lord!\"",
      "Brighter the Patronus, brighter and brighter, it was waxing\nfaster than on the day that Harry had destroyed a Dementor.",
      "\"My Lord!\" the silhouette said in a terrified whisper. \"Help me!\nEveryone will feel it, my Lord!\"",
      "Everyone will feel it, thought Harry. His imagination\ncould picture it clearly, the prisoners in their cells stirring as\nthe cold and darkness fell away, replaced by healing light.",
      "Every exposed surface now burned like a white sun in the\nreflections, the silhouette of Bellatrix's skeleton and the sallow\nman now clearly visible in the blaze, the Disillusionment spells\nunable to keep pace with the unearthly brilliance; only the Cloak\nof Invisibility out of the Deathly Hallows withstood it.",
      "\"My Lord! You must stop it!\u202f\"",
      "But Harry could no longer will it to stop, he no longer wanted\nit to stop. He could sense it, more and more of the sparks of life\nin Azkaban being sheltered by his Patronus, as it unfolded like\nspreading wings of sunlight, the air turned to absolute silver as\nhe thought it, Harry knew what he had to do.",
      "\"Please, my Lord!\u202f\"",
      "The words went unheard.",
      "They were far from him, the Dementors in their pit, but\nHarry knew that they could be destroyed even at this distance if\nthe light blazed bright enough, he knew that Death itself could not\nface him if he stopped holding back, so he unsealed all the gates\ninside him and sank the wells of his spell into all the deepest\nparts of his spirit, all his mind and all his will, and gave over\nabsolutely everything to the spell -",
      "And in the interior of the Sun, an only slightly dimmer shadow\nmoved forward, reaching out an entreating hand.",
      "WRONG\nDON'T",
      "The sudden sense of doom clashed with Harry's steel\ndetermination, dread and uncertainty striving against the bright\npurpose, nothing else might have reached him but that. The\nsilhouette took another step forward and another, the sense of doom\nrising to a point of terrible catastrophe; and in the drench of\ncold water, Harry saw it, he realized the consequences of what he\nwas doing, the danger and the trap.",
      "If you had been watching from outside you would have seen the\ninterior of the Sun brightening and dimming...",
      "Brightening and dimming...",
      "...and finally fading, fading, fading into ordinary moonlight\nthat seemed like pitch darkness by contrast.",
      "Within the darkness of that moonlight stood a sallow man with\nhis hand outstretched in entreaty, and the skeleton of a woman,\nlying upon the floor, a puzzled look upon her face.",
      "And Harry, still invisible, fallen to his knees. The greater\ndanger had passed, and now Harry was just trying not to collapse,\nto keep the spell going at the lower level. He'd drained something,\nhopefully not lost something - he should have known,\nshould have remembered, that it wasn't mere magic that fueled the\nPatronus Charm -",
      "\"Thank you, my Lord,\" whispered the sallow man.",
      "\"Fool,\" said the hard voice of a boy pretending to be a Dark\nLord. \"Did I not warn you that the spell could prove fatal if you\nfailed to control your emotions?\"",
      "Professor Quirrell's eyes did not widen, of course.",
      "\"Yes, my Lord, I understand,\" said the Dark Lord's servant in a\nfaltering voice, and turned to Bellatrix -",
      "She was already pushing herself off the floor, slowly, like an\nold, old Muggle woman. \"How funny,\" Bellatrix whispered, \"you were\nalmost killed by a Patronus Charm...\" A giggle that sounded like it\nwas blowing dust out of her giggle pipes. \"I could punish you,\nmaybe, if my Lord froze you in place and I had knives... maybe I\ncan be useful after all? Oh, I feel a little better now, how\nstrange...\"",
      "\"Be silent, dear Bella,\" Harry said in a chill voice, \"until I\ngive you leave to speak.\"",
      "There was no reply, which was obedience.",
      "The servant levitated the human skeleton, and made her invisible\nonce more, followed shortly by his own disappearance with the sound\nof another cracking egg.",
      "They passed on through the corridors of Azkaban.",
      "And Harry knew that as they passed, the prisoners were stirring\nin their cells as the fear lifted for one precious moment, maybe\neven feeling a small touch of healing as his light passed them by,\nand then collapsing down again as the cold and darkness pressed\nback in.",
      "Harry was trying very hard not to think about it.",
      "Otherwise his Patronus would wax until it burned away every\nDementor in Azkaban, blazing bright enough to destroy them even at\nthis distance...",
      "Otherwise his Patronus would wax until it burned away every\nDementor in Azkaban, taking all of Harry's life as fuel.",
      "In the Auror's quarters at the top of Azkaban, one Auror trio\nwas snoring in the barracks, one Auror trio was resting in the\nbreakroom, and one Auror trio was on duty in the command room,\nkeeping their watch. The command room was simple but large, with\nthree chairs at back where three Aurors sat, their wands always in\nhand to sustain their three Patronuses, as the bright white forms\npaced in front of the open window, sheltering them all from the\nDementors' fear.",
      "The three of them usually stuck to the back, and played poker,\nand didn't look out the window. You could have seen some sky there,\nsure, and there was even an hour or two every day where you\ncould've seen some sun, but that window also looked down on the\ncentral pit of hell.",
      "Just in case a Dementor wanted to float up and talk to you.",
      "There was no way that Auror Li would have agreed to serve duty\nhere, triple pay or no triple pay, if he hadn't had a family to\nsupport. (His real name was Xiaoguang, and everyone called him Mike\ninstead; he'd named his children Su and Kao, which hopefully would\nserve them better.) His only consolation, besides the money, was\nthat at least his mates played an excellent game of Dragon Poker.\nThough it would be hard not to, at this point.",
      "It was their 5,366th game and Li had what would probably be his\nbest hand of the 5300s. It was a Saturday in February and there\nwere three players, which let him shift the suit of any one hole\ncard except a two, three, or seven; and that was enough to let him\nbuild a Corps-a-Corps with Unicorns, Dragons, and sevens...",
      "Across the table from him, Gerard McCusker looked up from the\ntable cards toward the direction of the window, staring.",
      "The sinking feeling came over Li's stomach with surprising\nspeed.",
      "If his seven of hearts got hit by a Dementor Modifier and turned\ninto a six, he was going straight down to two pair and McCusker\nmight beat that -",
      "\"Mike,\" said McCusker, \"what's with your Patronus?\"",
      "Li turned his head and looked.",
      "His soft silver badger had turned away from its watch over the\npit and was staring downward at something only it could see.",
      "A moment later, Bahry's moonlit duck and McCusker's bright\nanteater followed suit, staring in the same downward direction.",
      "They all exchanged glances, and then sighed.",
      "\"I'll tell them,\" said Bahry. Protocol called for sending the\nthree Aurors who were off-duty but not sleeping to investigate\nanything anomalous. \"Maybe relieve one of them and take the C\nspiral, if you two don't mind.\"",
      "Li exchanged a glance with McCusker, and they both nodded. It\nwasn't too hard to break into Azkaban, if you were wealthy enough\nto hire a powerful wizard, and well-intentioned enough to recruit\nsomeone who could cast the Patronus Charm. People with friends in\nAzkaban would do that, break in just to give someone a half-day's\nworth of Patronus time, a chance at some real dreams instead of\nnightmares. Leave them a supply of chocolate to conceal in their\ncell, to increase the chance they lived through their sentence. And\nthe Aurors on guard... well, even if you got caught, you could\nprobably convince the Aurors to overlook it, in exchange for the\nright bribe.",
      "For Li, the right bribe tended to be in the range of two Knuts\nand a silver Sickle. He hated this place.",
      "But Bahry One-Hand had a wife and the wife had healer's bills,\nand if you could afford to hire someone who could break into\nAzkaban, then you could afford to grease Bahry's remaining palm\npretty hard, if he was the one who caught you.",
      "By unspoken agreement, none of them giving anything away by\nbeing the first to propose it, the three of them finished out their\npoker hand first. Li won, since no Dementors had actually shown up.\nAnd by then the Patronuses had stopped staring and gone back to\ntheir normal patrol, so it was probably nothing, but procedure was\nprocedure.",
      "After Li raked in the pot, Bahry gave them all formal nods, and\nstood up from the table. The older man's long white locks brushed\nagainst his fancy red robes, his robes brushed the metal floor of\nthe command room, as Bahry went through the separating door that\nled to the formerly off-duty Aurors.",
      "Li had been Sorted into Hufflepuff, and he sometimes felt a\nlittle queasy about this kind of business. But Bahry had shown them\nall the pictures, and you had to let a man do what he could for his\npoor sick wife, especially when he only had seven months left\nbefore his retirement.",
      "The faint green spark floated through the metal corridors, and\nthe silver humanoid, seeming a little dimmer now, followed after\nit. Sometimes the bright figure would flare, especially when they\npassed one of the huge metal doors, but it always died back down\nagain.",
      "Mere eyes could not have seen the invisible others: the\neleven-year-old Boy-Who-Lived, and the living skeleton that was\nBellatrix Black, and the Polyjuiced Defense Professor of Hogwarts,\nall traveling together through Azkaban. If that was the beginning\nof a joke, Harry didn't know the punchline.",
      "They'd gone up another four flights of stairs before the rough\nvoice of the Defense Professor said, simply and without emphasis,\n\"Auror coming.\"",
      "It took too long, a whole second maybe, for Harry to understand,\nfor the jolt of adrenaline to pump into his blood, and for him to\nremember what Professor Quirrell had already discussed with him and\ntold him to do in this case, and then Harry spun on his heel and\nflew back the way they'd come.",
      "Harry reached the flight of stairs, and frantically laid himself\ndown on the third step from the top, the cold metal feeling hard\neven through his cloak and robes. Trying to move his head up, to\npeer over the lip of the stairs, showed that he couldn't see\nProfessor Quirrell; and that meant that Harry was out of the line\nof any stray fire.",
      "His shining Patronus followed after him, and lay down beside him\non the step just beneath him; for it too must not be seen.",
      "There was a faint sound as of wind or whooshing, and then the\nsound of Bellatrix's invisible body coming to rest on a stair\nfurther below, she had no place in this except -",
      "\"Stay still,\" said the cold high whisper, \"stay silent.\"",
      "There was stillness, and silence.",
      "Harry pressed his wand against the side of the metal step just\nabove him. If he was anyone else he would have needed to take a\nKnut out of his pocket... or rip off a bit of cloth from his\nrobe... or bite off one of his nails... or find a speck of rock\nlarge enough that he could see it and solid enough to stay in one\nplace and orientation while it touched his wand. But with Harry's\nalmighty power of partial Transfiguration, this was not necessary;\nhe could skip that particular step of the operation and use any\nmaterial near to hand.",
      "Thirty seconds later Harry was the proud new owner of a curved\nmirror, and...",
      "\"Wingardium Leviosa,\" Harry whispered as quietly as he\ncould.",
      "...was levitating it just above the steps, and watching, in that\ncurved surface, almost the whole corridor where Professor Quirrell\ninvisibly waited.",
      "Harry heard it in the distance, then, the sound of\nfootsteps.",
      "And saw the form (a little hard to see in the mirror) of a\nperson in red robes, coming down the stairs, entering the seemingly\nempty corridor; accompanied by a small Patronus animal that Harry\ncouldn't quite make out.",
      "The Auror was protected by a blue shimmer, it was hard to see\nthe details but Harry could see that much, the Auror had shields\nalready raised and strengthened.",
      "Crap, thought Harry. According to the Defense\nProfessor, the essential art of dueling consisted of trying to put\nup defenses that would block whatever someone was likely to throw\nat you, while trying in turn to attack in ways that were likely to\ngo past their current set of defenses. And by far the easiest way\nto win any sort of real fight - Professor Quirrell had said this\nover and over - was to shoot the enemy before they raised a shield\nin the first place, either from behind or from close enough range\nthat they couldn't dodge or counter in time.",
      "Though Professor Quirrell might still be able to get in a shot\nfrom behind, if -",
      "But the Auror halted after taking three steps into the\ncorridor.",
      "\"Nice Disillusionment,\" said a hard male voice that Harry didn't\nrecognize. \"Now show yourself, or you'll be in real\ntrouble.\"",
      "The form of the sallow, bearded man became visible then.",
      "\"And you with the Patronus,\" said the hard voice. \"Come out too.\nNow.\"",
      "\"Wouldn't be smart,\" said the gravelly voice of the sallow man.\nIt was no longer the terrified voice of the Dark Lord's servant; it\nhad suddenly become the professional intimidation of a competent\ncriminal. \"You don't want to see who's behind me. Trust me, you\ndon't. Five hundred Galleons, cold cash up front, if you turn\naround and walk away. Big trouble for your career if you\ndon't.\"",
      "There was a long pause.",
      "\"Look, whoever you are,\" said the hard voice. \"You seem confused\nabout how this works. I don't care if that's Lucius Malfoy behind\nyou or Albus bloody Dumbledore. You all come out, I scan\nthe whole lot of you, and then we talk about how much this\nis going to cost you -\"",
      "\"Two thousand Galleons, final offer,\" said the gravelly voice,\ntaking on a warning undertone. \"That's ten times the going rate and\nmore than you make in a year. And believe me, if you see something\nyou shouldn't, you're going to regret not taking that -\"",
      "\"Shut it!\" said the hard voice. \"You've got exactly five seconds\nto drop that wand before I drop you. Five, four -\"",
      "What are you doing, Professor Quirrell? Harry thought\nfrantically. Attack first! Cast a shield at least!",
      "\"- three, two, one! Stupefy!\u202f\"",
      "Bahry stared, a chill running down his spine.",
      "The man's wand had moved so fast that it was like it had\nApparated into place, and Bahry's stunner was currently sparkling\ntamely at the end of it, not blocked, not countered, not deflected,\ncaught like a fly in honey.",
      "\"My offer has gone back down to five hundred Galleons,\" said the\nman in a colder, more formal voice. He smiled dryly, and the smile\nlooked wrong on that bearded face. \"And you shall need to accept a\nMemory Charm.\"",
      "Bahry had already swapped the harmonics on his shields so that\nhis own stunner couldn't pass back through, already tilted his wand\nback into a defensive position, already raised his hardened\nartificial hand into position to block anything blockable, and was\nalready thinking wordless spells to put more layers on his shields\n-",
      "The man wasn't looking at Bahry. Instead he was poking curiously\nat Bahry's stunner where it still wavered on the end of his wand,\ndrawing out red sparks and flicking them away with his fingers,\nslowly disassembling the hex like a child's rod puzzle.",
      "The man hadn't raised any shields of his own.",
      "\"Tell me,\" the man said in a disinterested voice that didn't\nseem to quite fit the rough throat - Polyjuice, Bahry would have\ncalled it, if he'd thought that anyone could possibly do magic that\ndelicate from inside someone else's body - \"what did you do in the\nlast war? Put yourself in harm's way, or stay out of trouble?\"",
      "\"Harm's way,\" said Bahry. His voice kept the iron calm of an\nAuror with nearly a hundred full years on the force, seven months\nshort of mandatory retirement, Mad-Eye Moody couldn't have said it\nwith any more hardness.",
      "\"Fight any Death Eaters?\"",
      "Now a grim smile graced Bahry's own face. \"Two at once.\" Two of\nYou-Know-Who's own warrior-assassins, personally trained by their\ndark master. Two Death Eaters at once against Bahry alone. It had\nbeen the toughest fight of Bahry's life, but he'd stood his ground,\nand walked away with only the loss of his left hand.",
      "\"Did you kill them?\" The man sounded idly curious, and he\ncontinued to draw threads of fire out of the much-diminished\nstunbolt still captive on the end of his wand, his fingers now\nweaving small patterns of Bahry's own magic before flicking to\ndisperse them.",
      "Sweat broke out on Bahry's skin beneath his robes. His metal\nhand flashed downward, ripped the mirror from his belt - \"Bahry to\nMike, I need backup!\"",
      "There was a pause, and silence.",
      "\"Bahry to Mike!\"",
      "The mirror lay dull and lifeless in his hand. Slowly, Bahry put\nit back on his belt.",
      "\"It's been quite a while since I had a serious fight with a\nserious opponent,\" the man said, still not looking up at Bahry.\n\"Try not to disappoint me too much. You can attack whenever you're\nready. Or you can walk away with five hundred Galleons.\"",
      "There was a long silence.",
      "Then the air screamed like metal cutting glass as Bahry slashed\nhis wand downward.",
      "Harry could hardly see it, could hardly make out anything amid\nthe lights and flashes, his mirror's curve was perfect (they'd\npracticed that tactic before in the Chaos Legion) but the scene was\nstill too small, and Harry had the feeling he wouldn't be able to\nunderstand even if he was watching from a meter away, it was all\nhappening too fast, red blasts deflecting from blue\nshields, green bars of light clashing together, shadowy forms\nappearing and vanishing, he couldn't even tell who was casting\nwhat, except that the Auror was shouting incantation after\nincantation and frantically dodging while Professor Quirrell's\nPolyjuiced form stood in one place and flicked his wand, mostly\nsilently, but now and then pronouncing words in unrecognizable\nlanguages that would white out the whole mirror and show half the\nAuror's shielding torn away as he staggered back.",
      "Harry had seen exhibition duels between the strongest\nseventh-year students, and this was so far above it that Harry's\nmind felt numbed, looking at how far he had left to go. There\nwasn't a single seventh-year student who could have lasted half a\nminute against the Auror, all three seventh-year armies put\ntogether might not be able to scratch the Defense Professor...",
      "The Auror had fallen to the ground, one knee and one hand\nsupporting himself as the other hand gestured frantically and his\nmouth shouted desperate words, the few incantations that Harry\nrecognized were all shield spells, as a flock of shadows spun\naround the Auror like a whirlwind of razors.",
      "And Harry saw Professor Quirrell's Polyjuiced form deliberately\npoint his wand at where the Auror kneeled and fought the last\nmoments of his battle.",
      "\"Surrender,\" said the gravelly voice.",
      "The Auror spat something unspeakable.",
      "\"In that case,\" said the voice, \"Avada -\"",
      "Time seemed to move very slowly, like there was time to hear the\nindividual syllables, Ke, and Da, and\nVra, time to watch the Auror starting to throw himself\ndesperately aside; and even though it was all happening so slowly,\nsomehow there wasn't time to do anything, no time for\nHarry to open his lips and scream NO, no time to move,\nmaybe even not any time to think.",
      "Only time for one desperate wish that an innocent man should not\ndie -",
      "And a blazing silver figure stood before the Auror.",
      "Stood there just a fraction of a second before the green light\nstruck home.",
      "Bahry was twisting frantically aside, not knowing if he was\ngoing to make it -",
      "His eyes were focused on his opponent and his onrushing death,\nso Bahry only briefly saw the outline of the brilliant silhouette,\nthe Patronus brighter than any he'd ever seen, saw it just barely\nlong enough to recognize the impossible shape, before the green and\nthe silver light collided and both lights vanished, both\nlights vanished, the Killing Curse had been blocked, and\nthen Bahry's ears were pierced as he saw his terrible opponent\nscreaming, screaming, screaming, clutching at his head and\nscreaming, starting to fall as Bahry was already falling -",
      "Bahry hit the ground, falling from his own frantic lunge, and\nhis dislocated left shoulder and broken rib screamed in protest.\nBahry ignored the pain, managed to scramble back to his knees,\nbrought up his wand to stun his opponent, he didn't understand what\nwas happening but he knew that this was his only chance.",
      "\"Stupefy!\u202f\"",
      "The red bolt struck out toward the man's falling body, and was\ntorn apart in midair and dissipated - and not by any shield. Bahry\ncould see it, the wavering in the air that surrounded his\nfallen and screaming opponent.",
      "Bahry could feel it like a deadly pressure on his skin, the flux\nof magic building and building and building toward some terrible\nbreaking point. His instincts screamed at him to run before the\nexplosion came, this was no Charm, no Curse, this was wizardry run\nwild, but before Bahry could even finish getting to his feet -",
      "The man threw his wand away from himself (he threw away his\nwand!) and a second later, his form blurred and vanished\nentirely.",
      "A green snake lay motionless on the ground, unmoving even before\nBahry's next stunner spell, fired in sheer reflex, hit it without\nresistance.",
      "As the dreadful flux and pressure began to dissipate, as the\nwild wizardry died back down, Bahry's dazed mind noticed that the\nscream was continuing. Only it sounded different, like the scream\nof a young boy, coming from the stairs leading down to the next\nlower level.",
      "That scream choked off too, and then there was silence except\nfor Bahry's frantic panting.",
      "His thoughts were slow, confused, disarrayed. His opponent had\nbeen insanely powerful, that hadn't been a duel, it had\nbeen like his first year as a trainee Auror trying to fight Madam\nTarma. The Death-Eaters hadn't been a tenth that good, Mad-Eye\nMoody wasn't that good... and who, what, how in the name of\nMerlin's balls had anyone blocked a Killing Curse?",
      "Bahry managed to summon the energy to press his wand against his\nrib, mutter the healing spell, and then press it again to his\nshoulder. It took more out of him than it should have, took far too\nmuch out of him, his magic was within a bare breath of utter\nexhaustion; he didn't have anything left for his minor cuts and\nbruises or even to reinforce the scraps left of his shielding. It\nwas all he could do not to let his Patronus go out.",
      "Bahry breathed deeply, heavily, steadied his breath as much as\nhe could before he spoke.",
      "\"You,\" Bahry said. \"Whoever you are. Come out.\"",
      "There was silence, and it occurred to Bahry that whoever it was\nmight be unconscious. He didn't understand what had just happened,\nbut he'd heard the scream...",
      "Well, there was one way to test that.",
      "\"Come out,\" said Bahry, making his voice harder, \"or I start\nusing area-effect curses.\" He probably couldn't have managed one if\nhe'd tried.",
      "\"Wait,\" said a boy's voice, a young boy's voice, high\nand thin and wavering, like someone was holding back exhaustion or\ntears. The voice now seemed to be coming from closer to hand.\n\"Please wait. I'm - coming out -\"",
      "\"Drop the invisibility,\" growled Bahry. He was too tired to\nbother with anti-Disillusionment Charms.",
      "A moment later, a young boy's face emerged from within an\nunfolding invisibility cloak, and Bahry saw the black hair, the\ngreen eyes, the glasses, and the angry red lightning-bolt scar.",
      "If he'd had twenty fewer years of experience under his belt he\nmight have blinked. Instead he just spat something that he probably\nshouldn't ought to say in front of the Boy-Who-Lived.",
      "\"He, he,\" the boy's wavering voice said, his young face looked\nfrightened and exhausted and tears were still trickling down his\ncheeks, \"he kidnapped me, to make me cast my Patronus... he said\nhe'd kill me if I didn't... only I couldn't let him just kill\nyou...\"",
      "Bahry's mind was still dazed, but things were slowly starting to\nclick into place.",
      "Harry Potter, the only wizard ever to survive a Killing Curse.\nBahry might have been able to dodge the green death, he'd certainly\nbeen trying, but if the matter came up before the Wizengamot,\nthey'd rule it was a life debt to a Noble House.",
      "\"I see,\" Bahry said in a much gentler growl. He started to walk\ntoward the boy. \"Son, I'm sorry for what you've been through, but I\nneed you to drop the cloak and drop your wand.\"",
      "The rest of Harry Potter emerged from invisibility, showing the\nsweat-soaked blue-trimmed Hogwarts robes, and his right hand\nclutching an eleven-inch holly wand so hard his knuckles were\nwhite.",
      "\"Your wand,\" Bahry repeated.",
      "\"Sorry,\" whispered the eleven-year-old boy, \"here,\" and he held\nout the wand toward Bahry.",
      "Bahry barely stopped himself from snarling at the traumatized\nboy who'd just saved his life. Instead he overrode the impulse with\na sigh, and just stretched out a hand to take the wand. \"Look, son,\nyou're really not supposed to point a wand at -\"",
      "The wand's end twisted lightly beneath Bahry's hand just as the\nboy whispered, \"Somnium.\"",
      "Harry stared at the Auror's crumpled body, there was no sense of\ntriumph, just a crushing sense of despair.",
      "(Even then it might not have been too late.)",
      "Harry turned to look at where the green snake lay\nmotionless.",
      "\"Teacher?\u202f\" hissed Harry. \"Friend? Pleasse, are you\nalive?\u202f\" An awful fear was taking hold in Harry's heart; in\nthat moment he had entirely forgotten that he'd just seen the\nDefense Professor try to kill a police officer.",
      "Harry pointed his wand at the snake, and his lips even began to\nshape the word Innervate, before his brain caught up with\nhim and screamed at him.",
      "He didn't dare use magic on Professor Quirrell.",
      "Harry had felt it, the burning, tearing pain in his head, like\nhis brain was about to split in half. He'd felt it, his magic and\nProfessor Quirrell's magic, matched and anti-harmonized in a\nfulfillment of doom. That was the mysterious terrible thing that\nwould happen if Harry and Professor Quirrell ever got too close to\neach other, or if they ever cast magic on each other, or if\ntheir spells ever touched, their magic would resonate out\nof control -",
      "Harry stared at the snake, he couldn't tell if it was\nbreathing.",
      "(The last seconds ticked away.)",
      "He turned to stare at the Auror, who had seen the Boy-Who-Lived,\nwho knew.",
      "The full magnitude of the disaster crushed in on Harry like a\nthousand hundred-ton weights, he'd managed to stun the Auror but\nnow there was nothing left to do, no way to recover, the mission\nhad failed, everything had failed, he had failed.",
      "Shocked, dismayed, despairing, he didn't think of it,\ndidn't see the obvious, didn't remember where the hopeless feelings\nwere coming from, didn't realize that he still needed to recast the\nTrue Patronus Charm.",
      "(And then it was already too late.)",
      "Auror Li and Auror McCusker had rearranged their chairs around\nthe table, and so they both saw it at the same time, the naked,\nskeletally thin horror rising up to hover outside the window, the\nheadache already hitting them from seeing it.",
      "They both heard the voice, like a long-dead corpse had spoken\nwords and those words themselves had aged and died.",
      "The Dementor's speech hurt their ears as it said, \"Bellatrix\nBlack is out of her cell.\"",
      "There was a split second of horrified silence, and then Li tore\nout of his chair, heading for the communicator to call in\nreinforcements from the Ministry, even as McCusker grabbed his\nmirror and started frantically trying to raise the three Aurors\nwho'd gone on patrol."

      "In a scarred and ruined corridor, lit by dim gas lights, a boy\nslowly crept forward, one hand stretched out, toward the unmoving\nsnake that was the body of his teacher.",
      "Harry was only a meter away from the snake's body when he first\nfelt it, tickling at the edge of his perception.",
      "Ever so weakly, a sense of doom...",
      "Professor Quirrell was alive, then.",
      "The thought engendered no feeling of joy, only a sort of empty\ndespair.",
      "Harry would still be caught soon, and no matter how he tried to\nexplain, it still wouldn't look good. No one would trust him again,\nthey would think he was the next Dark Lord, they wouldn't help him\nwhen it came time to fight Lord Voldemort, Hermione would give up\non him, probably even Dumbledore would look for another hero...",
      "...maybe they'd just send him home to his parents.",
      "He had failed.",
      "Harry looked at the crumpled body of the police officer he'd\nstunned, the already-drying blood from the minor cuts and slashes,\nthe burned places on the intricately embroidered red robes.",
      "He'd been stupid. He shouldn't have stunned the police\nofficer, should have just stayed with his original story\nabout being kidnapped by Professor Quirrell...",
      "It might not be too late, whispered a voice inside him.\nYou might still be able to fix your mistake. The Auror saw you,\nhe remembers that you stunned him... but if he were dead, if\nProfessor Quirrell were dead, if Bellatrix were dead, there would\nbe no one to contradict your story.",
      "Slowly, Harry's hand started to rise, pointing his wand at the\npolice officer and -",
      "Harry's hand halted.",
      "He had a distant sense he was behaving uncharacteristically of\nhimself, somehow. Like there was something he'd forgotten,\nsomething important, but he was having trouble remembering what it\nwas, exactly.",
      "Oh. That was right. He was someone who believed in the value of\nhuman life.",
      "A sense of puzzlement accompanied the thought, he couldn't quite\nremember why other people's lives had seemed\nvaluable...",
      "All right, said the logical part of him, why has my\nmind changed between then and now?",
      "Because he was in Azkaban...",
      "And he'd forgotten to recast the Patronus Charm...",
      "Doing anything at all, somehow, seemed like a tremendous effort,\nlike the thought of action itself was a weight too heavy to lift;\nbut it did seem like a good idea to recast the Patronus Charm, for\nhe was still able to be afraid of Dementors. And though he couldn't\nremember what it was like to be happy, he knew that this wasn't\nit.",
      "Harry's hand rose to hold his wand level before him, his fingers\ntook the starting positions.",
      "And then Harry paused.",
      "He couldn't... quite remember... what he'd used as his happy\nthought.",
      "That was odd, it had been something very important, he really\nought to be able to remember it... something to do with death? But\nthat wasn't happy...",
      "His body was shivering, Azkaban hadn't seemed so cold before,\nand it seemed to be getting colder even as he thought. It was too\nlate for him, he'd already sunk too far, he'd never be able to cast\nthe Patronus Charm now -",
      "That may be the Dementation talking rather than an accurate\nestimate, observed the logical part of himself, habits that\nhad been encoded into sheer reflex, requiring no energy to\nactivate. Think of the Dementors' fear as a cognitive bias, and\ntry to overcome it the way you would overcome any other cognitive\nbias. Your hopeless feelings may not indicate that the situation is\nactually hopeless. It may only indicate that you are in the\npresence of Dementors. All negative emotions and pessimistic\nestimates must now be considered suspect, fallacious until proven\nvalid.",
      "(If you'd been watching the boy as he thought, you would have\nseen a distant, abstract, puzzled frown move across his face, below\nthe glasses and the lightning-bolt scar. His hand stayed in the\nstarting position for the Patronus Charm, and did not move.)",
      "The presence of Dementors interferes with the part of you\nthat processes happiness. If you cannot retrieve your happy thought\nby mnemonic association on the key of happiness, perhaps you can\nget at the memory some other way instead. When was the last time\nyou talked to someone about the Patronus Charm?",
      "Harry couldn't seem to remember that either.",
      "A crushing wave of despair swept over him, and was dismissed by\nthe logical part of himself as untrustworthy, external, not-Harry,\nthe dull weight still pressed him down but his mind went on\nthinking, it didn't take much effort to think...",
      "When was the last time you talked to someone about\nDementors?",
      "Professor Quirrell had said that he was already able to feel the\npresence of Dementors, and Harry had said to Professor Quirrell...\nhe'd told Professor Quirrell...",
      "...to hold to the memory of the stars, of falling bodilessly\nthrough space, like an Occlumency barrier across his entire\nmind.",
      "His second Defense class of the year, on Friday, that was when\nProfessor Quirrell had shown him the stars, and again on\nChristmas.",
      "It didn't take much effort to remember them, the searing points\nof white against perfect blackness.",
      "Harry remembered the great cloudy wash of the Milky Way.",
      "Harry remembered the peace.",
      "Some of the coldness at the fringes of his limbs seemed to\nretreat.",
      "There were words he had spoken out loud on the day he'd first\ncast the Patronus Charm, his mind could remember the sounds and the\nspeech even as the feelings seemed distant...",
      "...I thought of my absolute rejection of death as the\nnatural order.",
      "You cast the True Patronus Charm by thinking about the value of\nhuman life.",
      "...But there are other lives that are still alive to be\nfought for. Your life, and my life, and Hermione Granger's life,\nall the lives of Earth, and all the lives beyond, to be defended\nand protected.",
      "Then the idea of killing everyone... that hadn't been his true\nself, that had been the Dementation talking...",
      "Despair was the Dementors' influence.",
      "Where there's life, there's hope. The Auror is still alive.\nProfessor Quirrell is still alive. Bellatrix is still alive. I'm\nstill alive. No one's actually died yet...",
      "Harry could picture the Earth, now, in the midst of the\nstarfield, the blue-white orb.",
      "...and I won't let them!",
      "\"Expecto Patronum!\"",
      "The words came out a little halting, and when the human shape\nburst back into existence it was dim at first, moonlight instead of\nsunlight, white instead of silver.",
      "But it strengthened, slowly, as Harry breathed in deliberate\nrhythm, recovering. Letting the light drive back the darkness from\nhis mind. Remembering the things that he had almost forgotten, and\nchanneling them back into the Patronus Charm.",
      "Even when the light blazed full and silver once more,\nilluminating the corridor more brightly than the gas lamps,\nbanishing fully the cold, Harry's limbs still shook. That had been\ntoo close.",
      "Harry took a deep breath. All right. It was time to reconsider\nthe situation now that his thoughts were no longer being\nartificially darkened by Dementors.",
      "Harry reviewed the situation.",
      "...still looked pretty hopeless, actually.",
      "It wasn't the crushing despair of before, but Harry still felt\nwobbly, to put it mildly. He didn't dare go dark and it was his\ndark side that had the ability to take this level of problem in\nstride. It was his dark side that would have laughed scornfully at\nthe very concept of giving up just because he'd lost Professor\nQuirrell and was marooned in the depths of Azkaban and had been\nseen by a police officer. The ordinary Harry was not able to take\nthat sort of thing in stride.",
      "But there wasn't any option except to keep moving forward\nanyway. You couldn't get any more pointless than giving up\nbefore you'd actually lost.",
      "Harry looked around.",
      "Dim gas lights lit a corridor of grey metal, whose sides and\nfloor and ceiling were slashed in places, gouged and melted,\ntelling anyone who cared to look that there had been battle\nhere.",
      "Professor Quirrell could have repaired it easily enough, if\nhe'd...",
      "The sense of betrayal struck Harry with full force, then.",
      "Why... why did he... why...",
      "Because he's evil, said Gryffindor and Hufflepuff,\nquietly and sadly. We told you so.",
      "No! thought Harry desperately. No, it doesn't make\nsense, we were going to commit the perfect crime, the Auror could\nhave been Obliviated, the corridor repaired, it wasn't too late but\nit would have BEEN too late if he'd died!",
      "But Professor Quirrell was never really planning to commit\nthe perfect crime, said the grim voice of Slytherin.\nHe wanted the crime to be noticed. He wanted everyone\nto know that someone had killed an Auror and broken Bellatrix Black\nout of Azkaban. He would have prepared some kind of evidence, some\nproof he could reveal of your involvement, to use as blackmail\nagainst you; and you would have been bound to him forever.",
      "Harry's Patronus almost went out, then.",
      "No... Harry thought.",
      "Yes, said the other three parts of him sadly.",
      "No. It still doesn't make sense. Professor Quirrell had to\nknow I would turn against him the instant I saw him kill an Auror.\nThat I might very well go ahead and confess to Dumbledore, hoping\nto plead the true fact that I was tricked. And... in terms of\nblackmail, does his killing an Auror against my will, really add\nall that much to breaking Bellatrix out of Azkaban with my\nwilling help? It would have been more cunning to keep the evidence\nof my involvement with the basic crime, but still pretend to be my\nally for as long as he could, saving the blackmail to use only if\nit became necessary...",
      "Rationalization, said Slytherin. So why did\nProfessor Quirrell do it, then?",
      "And Harry thought with a tinge of desperation - knowing, even as\nhe thought it, that he was motivated in part by a desire to reject\nreality, and that wasn't how the technique was meant to be wielded\n- I notice that I am confused.",
      "There was internal silence. None of the parts of himself seemed\nto have anything to add to that.",
      "And Harry continued to take stock of the moderately\nhopeless-looking situation.",
      "Did Harry need to re-evaluate the probability that Bellatrix was\nevil?",
      "...not in any mission-relevant sense. It was a given\nthat Bellatrix was currently evil. Whether she was an innocent\nwho'd been made that way by torture and Legilimency and unspeakable\nrituals, or whether she'd chosen it of her own will, didn't have\nmuch bearing on the current situation. The key fact was that while\nBellatrix thought Harry was the Dark Lord, she would obey him.",
      "That was one resource, then. But Bellatrix was starved and\nnine-tenths dead...",
      "'Oh, I feel a little better now, how strange...'",
      "Bellatrix had said that, in her shattered voice, after Harry's\nPatronus had blazed out of control.",
      "Harry thought, and he couldn't have quite said why he\nthought this, it might have just been his own mind making things\nup, but... it seemed likely that what the Dementors had taken from\nyou long ago was lost forever. But what the Dementors had taken\nfrom you recently, the True Patronus Charm might give\nback. Like the difference between emptying a cup, and the unused\ncup fading away. Bellatrix, then, might have got back what she'd\nlost in just the last week or so. Not any happy memories, those\nwould have been eaten years ago. But whatever strength and magic\nhad been drained from her in just the last week, she might have\nregained. Like the equivalent of getting a week of rest, a week to\nbuild up her magic again...",
      "Harry looked at Professor Quirrell's snake form.",
      "...maybe enough for an Innervate.",
      "If awakening Professor Quirrell was, in fact, a smart\nthing to do.",
      "Some of the despair came back to Harry, then. He couldn't trust\nProfessor Quirrell, couldn't trust that reviving him would be wise,\nnot after what had just happened.",
      "Steady, Harry thought to himself, and looked at the\ncrumpled form of the Auror.",
      "Bellatrix might also be able to manage a Memory\nCharm.",
      "That could be step one, anyway. It wasn't exactly getting\neveryone safely out of Azkaban, and the Aurors would know\nafterward that something strange had happened, they might suspect\nBellatrix's body and perform an autopsy. But it was a step.",
      "...and would it be all that hard to get out of Azkaban?\nIf they could get to the top of Azkaban quickly enough, before the\nAuror was supposed to report back in, before anyone noticed him\nmissing, then they could just fly out through the hole Professor\nQuirrell had made, and get far enough away from Azkaban to activate\nthe portkey Harry already had in his possession. (Both Professor\nQuirrell and Harry had portkeys, and both were powerful enough to\ntransport two humans, plus or minus a snake. As with their\ndoubly-concealed departure from Mary's Room, Professor Quirrell had\nput enough safety margin in his plans to impress even Harry.)",
      "Bellatrix could carry Professor Quirrell's snake form, which\nHarry dared not touch or levitate.",
      "Harry turned and strode quickly toward where Bellatrix was\nwaiting on the stairs. He could feel his spirits reviving a little.\nIt was starting to look like a good plan, and there was no\ntime to waste in going about it.",
      "What to do with Professor Quirrell, or for that matter\nBellatrix, after the portkey took them to where they were supposed\nto hand Bellatrix over to the psychiatric healer... well, Harry\ncould work that out along the way. Harry would probably have to\nbamboozle the healer into doing something - which was going to take\none hell of a bamboozling, and Harry wasn't even sure what he\nwanted done - but he and Bellatrix had to get moving\nnow.",
      "The main problem Harry saw, as he quickly ran the whole process\nforward in his imagination, would come when they reached the roof.\nProfessor Quirrell had been supposed to sneak around invisibly and\nConfund the monitors that would notice visitors in the aerial\nsurroundings of Azkaban, causing them to see a repeating loop of\nscenery for a few minutes. Professor Quirrell had said that he\ncouldn't Disillusion Harry's Patronus; and if they switched\noff the Patronus, the Dementors would notice Bellatrix was\nmissing, and alert the Aurors...",
      "Harry's train of thought stumbled.",
      "There were times when 'Aw, crap' just didn't seem to cover\nit.",
      "Li's hands were sure despite the adrenaline, as he unlocked the\nbars on the Vanishing Cabinet that linked Azkaban to a well-guarded\nroom in the interior of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.\n(A one-way Vanishing Cabinet, of course. The wards permitted a few\nfast ways into Azkaban, all of them highly restricted, and\nno fast ways out.)",
      "Li stepped well back, pointed his wand at the Cabinet, spoke the\nincantation \"Harmonia Nectere Passus\", and not a second\nlater -",
      "The door of the Cabinet burst open with a bang, and into the\nroom strode a heavy-set, square-jawed witch with greyed hair\ncropped close around her head. She wore no rank signs as she wore\nno jewelry or other ornamentation, it was only an ordinary Auror's\nrobes that she deemed fit to grace herself: Director Amelia Bones,\nhead of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and said to be\nthe only witch in the DMLE who could take Mad-Eye Moody in a fair\nfight (not that either of those two were the sort to fight fairly).\nLi had heard rumors that Amelia could Apparate within the bounds of\nthe DMLE, and this was the sort of thing that gave rise to rumors\nlike that, he'd called in the alarm not fifty seconds ago.",
      "\"Get into the air, now!\" Amelia barked over her shoulder at the\nfemale Auror trio following behind her with police broomsticks,\nthey must have all been crushed in there, waiting for Li to\nactivate the Cabinet. \"I want more aerial coverage on this place!\nAnd make sure you keep up your anti-Disillusionment Charms!\" Then\nher head turned toward him. \"Report, Auror Li! Do we know how they\ngot in yet?\"",
      "Another Auror trio holding broomsticks materialized in the\nVanishing Cabinet and strode out after them even as Li began\ntalking.",
      "They were followed by a trio of Hit Wizards in full battle\ngear.",
      "Then another trio of Hit Wizards.",
      "Then another broomstick team.",
      "The emaciated form that was Bellatrix Black was resting\nmotionless on the stairs when Harry got there, eyes closed, and\nwhen Harry asked in a cold, high whisper whether she was awake, he\ngot no response.",
      "A brief twitch of panic was countered by the thought that\nProfessor Quirrell had knocked her out to prevent her from hearing\nthe Dark Lord's cringing servant suddenly turn into a hardened\ncriminal and then an expert battlemage. Which was good, because she\nwouldn't have heard Harry's voice saying 'Expecto Patronum'.",
      "Harry drew back the hood of the Cloak, pointed his wand at\nBellatrix, and whispered as gently as he could,\n\"Innervate.\"",
      "From the way Bellatrix's body jerked a little, Harry didn't\nthink he'd managed to get it quite gentle enough.",
      "The sunken dark eyes opened.",
      "\"Bella dear,\" Harry said in his cold, high voice, \"I am afraid\nwe've run into a bit of a problem. Have you recovered enough to do\nsmall magics?\"",
      "There was a pause, and then Bellatrix's pale head nodded.",
      "\"Very good,\" Harry said dryly. \"I won't ask you to walk unaided,\nBella dear, but I am afraid you must walk.\" He pointed his wand at\nher. \"Wingardium Leviosa.\"",
      "Harry kept the flow of force down to something he could sustain\nfor a while, and it was still probably lifting two-thirds of her\ncurrent body weight. She was... thin.",
      "Slowly, as though for the first time in years, Bellatrix Black\npushed herself to her feet.",
      "Amelia strode into the duty room, Auror Li and his silver badger\nfollowing behind her. She'd spun her Time-Turner the moment she'd\nheard the alarm, and then spent a tense hour preparing her forces\nfor entry. You couldn't loop time within Azkaban itself,\nAzkaban's future couldn't interact with its past, so she hadn't\nbeen able to arrive before the DMLE had gotten the message, but she\nshould have arrived in time...",
      "Her eyes went straight to the corpse, uncloaked and looking very\ndead, floating beyond the viewing window.",
      "\"Where is Bellatrix Black?\" Amelia demanded, showing no fear\nbefore the creature of fear.",
      "Even her own blood froze for an instant, as the corpse parted\nits lips, and gurgled, \"Do not know.\"",
      "Harry watched, now fully invisible once more, as Bellatrix\nslowly leaned down, took Professor Quirrell's wand (which Harry\ndared not touch), and slowly straightened again.",
      "Then Bellatrix pointed the wand at the snake, and said, her\nvoice precise though it was still a whisper,\n\"Innervate.\"",
      "The snake did not stir.",
      "\"Shall I try again, my Lord?\" she whispered.",
      "\"No,\" Harry said. He swallowed the sick feeling. Harry had\ndecided to say the hell with it and try to revive Professor\nQuirrell after he'd realized that the Dementors had probably\nalerted the Aurors by now. His high, cold voice went on,\nunperturbed, \"Do you think you are able to perform a Memory Charm,\ndear Bella?\"",
      "Bellatrix paused, and then said, hesitantly, \"I think so, my\nLord.\"",
      "\"Eliminate that Auror's last half-hour of memory,\" Harry\ncommanded. He'd thought a bit about whether he wanted to provide\nany justification for that, what he would say if Bellatrix asked\nwhy they weren't just killing him, in which case Harry would\nexplain that they were pretending to be a different power group and\nthen tell her to shut up -",
      "But Bellatrix simply pointed her wand at the Auror, stood\nsilently for a time, and finally whispered,\n\"Obliviate.\"",
      "She swayed, then, but did not fall.",
      "\"Very good, my dear Bella,\" Harry said, and chuckled thinly.\n\"And I will ask you to carry that snake.\"",
      "Again, the woman said nothing, demanded no explanations, didn't\nask why Harry or the apparently-invisible Patronus caster couldn't\ndo it. She only staggered to where the long snake lay, slowly bent\nover, picked it up, draped it over her shoulder.",
      "(A tiny little part of Harry observed that it was very\nrelaxing to have a minion that would just follow orders so\nunquestioningly, and even got as far as thinking that he could\ntotally get used to having a minion like Bellatrix, before that\nmind-fraction was screamed into silence by his mortally offended\nremainder.)",
      "\"Follow,\" the boy commanded his minion, and began to walk.",
      "It was starting to get crowded in the duty room, almost too\ncrowded to breathe, though there was still space around Amelia\nherself; if needing to breathe meant that you had to crowd Director\nBones, it was better not to breathe.",
      "Amelia looked at where Ora was fiddling with Auror McCusker's\nmirror. \"Specialist Weinbach,\" she barked, causing the young witch\nto start. \"Any response from One-Hand's mirror?\"",
      "\"None,\" Ora said nervously, \"it's... I mean it has to be jammed,\nnot dead, carefully jammed because it didn't set off the alarms,\nbut the line is so blank the mirror might as well be broken...\"",
      "Amelia didn't let her expression change, though the part of her\nthat was already mourning One-Hand got a little sadder and a lot\nmore angry. Seven months, he'd had seven months left until his\nretirement after a full century of service. She remembered him as\nan eager young Auror, so very long ago, and his whole career he'd\nserved the DMLE with perfect loyalty, at least when it came to\nanything really important...",
      "Someone would burn for this.",
      "The Dementor still hovered outside the window, casting its\nuseless shadow of dread over their operations; all the creature\ncould do was gurgle its lack of knowledge or fail to reply at all,\nwhen asked questions like 'Did Bellatrix Black escape?' and 'Why\ncan't you find her?' and 'How is she being hidden?' Amelia was\nstarting to worry that the criminals were already gone, when -",
      "\"We found a hole in the roof over C spiral!\" someone shouted\nfrom the doorway. \"Still open, ward circumventions still\nactive!\"",
      "Amelia's lips peeled back in a smile like a wolf opening its\njaws to eat.",
      "Bellatrix Black was still in Azkaban.",
      "And in Azkaban, Bellatrix Black would remain forever.",
      "She took a stride toward the window, ignoring the Dementor now,\nand looked up at the sky above, to check with her own eyes the\npatrolling broomsticks. She couldn't see the whole sky from here,\nbut she saw ten brooms go past on a patrol pattern and that already\nought to be enough to catch anyone, though she fully meant to put\nevery broom she could in the air. Her Aurors were equipped with the\nfastest racing broom currently on the market, the Nimbus 2000; no\nunsuccessful chases for her people.",
      "Amelia turned back from the window, and frowned. The room was\ngetting ridiculously crowded, and two thirds of these people didn't\nneed to be here, they just wanted to be close to\nthe center of the action. If there was one thing Amelia couldn't\ntolerate, it was people who did what they wanted instead of what\nwas needed.",
      "\"All right, you lot!\" Amelia bellowed at them. \"Stop hanging\naround here and start securing the top level of each spiral! That's\nright,\" she said to the looks of surprise, \"all three! They could\ntunnel through a floor or a ceiling to go between them, in case you\nhadn't worked that out! We're going down level by level until we\ncatch them! I'll take C spiral, Scrimgeour, you're on B...\" She\npaused, then, remembering that Mad-Eye had retired last year, who\ncould she... \"Shacklebolt, you're on the A spiral, take with the\nstrongest other fighters! Check every set of cells you pass, look\nunder blankets, do the full set of detection Charms in every\ncorridor! Nobody leaves Azkaban until the criminals are caught,\nnobody! And...\" People looked at Amelia in surprise as her voice\ntrailed off.",
      "The criminals had invented some way to prevent the Dementors\nfrom finding Bellatrix Black.",
      "That ought to have been impossible.",
      "It chilled her blood, contemplating that. It was like...",
      "Amelia took a deep breath, and spoke once more, in a voice of\nsteel command. \"And when you catch them, make bloody sure they're\nthe real criminals and not our own people forced to take Polyjuice.\nAnyone behaves oddly, check them for the Imperius Curse. Keep each\nother in sight at all times. Don't assume an Auror uniform is\nfriendly if you don't recognize the face.\" She turned to the\ncommunications specialist. \"Tell the broomsticks. If one of the\nbrooms peels off for no reason, half of them are to hunt\nit down while the rest keep patrolling. And change the\nharmonics on everything changeable, they may have stolen our keys.\"\nThen back to the rest of the room. \"No Auror is above suspicion\nunless they have no family left to threaten.\"",
      "She saw it, the cold looks that came over the older faces, saw\nsome of the younger Aurors flinch, and knew that they\nunderstood.",
      "But she said it out loud, just to be sure.",
      "\"We're fighting the old Wizarding War today, everyone. Just\nbecause You-Know-Who is dead doesn't mean the Death Eaters have\nforgotten his tricks. Now go!\u202f\"",
      "Harry walked in silence through the gas-lit grey corridor,\ninvisible beside Bellatrix and the silver shape following them,\ntrying to think of a better plan.",
      "At first, when he'd realized that the Aurors probably knew\nalready, and that moreover, Professor Quirrell wasn't waking\nup...",
      "His thoughts had frozen up there, for a second.",
      "And then stayed frozen, even as he'd gotten himself and\nBellatrix heading downward, to buy as much time as possible; the\nAurors, Harry figured, would start at the top and move down level\nby level. The Aurors could afford to move slowly and securely; they\nknew their prey had no way out.",
      "Harry hadn't been able to think of any way out.",
      "Until Harry had said to himself, well, if it was just a war\ngame, what would General Chaos do?",
      "From which an answer had followed instantly.",
      "And then Harry had thought, but if it's that easy,\nwhy hasn't anyone broken out of Azkaban before?",
      "And after he'd realized the possible problem: Fine, what\nwould General Chaos do about that?",
      "Whereupon General Chaos had come up with an amendment to his\nfirst plan.",
      "It was...",
      "It was the most insanely Gryffindor thing Harry had\never...",
      "So now he was trying to think of a better plan, and not\nhaving much luck.",
      "Picky picky picky, said Gryffindor. Who was\ncomplaining about not having any plan one minute earlier?\nYou should be glad we came up with anything at all, Mister\nNow-We're-Doomed.",
      "\"My Lord,\" Bellatrix whispered haltingly, as she navigated the\nnext flight of stairs downward, \"am I going back to my cell, my\nLord?\"",
      "Harry's brain was distracted, so it took him that long to\nprocess the words, and then another moment to process the horror,\nwhile Bellatrix continued speaking.",
      "\"I would... please, my Lord, I would very much rather die,\" her\nvoice said. And then, in a smaller voice, a whisper that was barely\nthere, \"but I will go back if you ask it of me, my Lord...\"",
      "\"We are not going back to your cell,\" hissed Harry's voice, on\nautomatic. Nothing of what he felt was allowed to reach his\nface.",
      "Um... said Hufflepuff. Did you seriously just\nthink, 'You ought to work for me, I would appreciate\nyou?'",
      "A stone would respond to that kind of loyalty, Harry\nthought. Even if I'm only getting it by mistake, I can't help\nbut -",
      "She's the Dark Lord's loyal killer and torturer, and the\nsupposed reason she's loyal is because an innocent girl was broken\ninto pieces and used as raw material to make her, said\nHufflepuff. Did you forget?",
      "If someone shows me that much loyalty, even by mistake,\nthere's a part of me that can't help but feel something. The Dark\nLord must have been... evil doesn't seem like a strong\nenough word, he must have been empty... to not appreciate\nher loyalty, artificial or not.",
      "The better parts of Harry didn't have much to say to that.",
      "And that was when Harry heard it.",
      "It was faint, and it grew louder with every step they took\nforward.",
      "A woman's voice, distant, indistinct.",
      "His ears, automatically, strained to make out the words.",
      "\"...please don't...\"",
      "\"...didn't mean...\"",
      "\"...don't die...\"",
      "Then his brain knew who he was hearing, and in almost\nthe same moment, figured out what he was hearing.",
      "Because Professor Quirrell wasn't there to keep the silence any\nmore, and Azkaban was not, in fact, silent.",
      "Faint the woman's voice, repeating:",
      "\"No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!\"",
      "\"No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!\"",
      "It got louder with every step Harry took, he could hear the\nemotion in the words now, the horror, the remorse, the desperation\nof...",
      "\"No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!\"",
      "...the woman's worst memory, rehearsing over and over\nagain...",
      "\"No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!\"",
      "...the murder that had sent her to Azkaban...",
      "\"No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!\"",
      "...where she was sentenced by the Dementors to watch whoever\nshe'd killed, die and die and die in an infinite repeating loop.\nThough she must have been put in Azkaban recently, from the amount\nof life left in her voice.",
      "The thought came to Harry, then, that Professor Quirrell had\npassed those doors, heard those sounds, and given not the slightest\nsign of disturbance; and Harry would have called it a positive\nproof of evil, if Harry's own lips hadn't remained silent in the\npresence of Bellatrix, his breathing regular, while something\ninside him screamed and screamed and screamed.",
      "The Patronus brightened, not out of control, but it brightened,\nwith every step Harry took forward.",
      "It brightened further as Harry and Bellatrix descended the\nstairs, she stumbled and Harry offered her his left arm thrust\noutside the Cloak, braving the sense of doom from being that close\nto the snake draped around her neck. There was a surprised look on\nher face, but she accepted it, and said nothing.",
      "It helped Harry, being able to help Bellatrix, but it wasn't\nenough.",
      "Not when he saw the huge metal door in the center of that\nlevel's corridor.",
      "Not when they came closer, and the woman's voice fell silent,\nbecause there was a Patronus near her now, and she wasn't reliving\nher worst memory any more.",
      "Good, said a voice inside him. That was step\none.",
      "Harry's steps carried him inevitably forward toward the metal\ndoor.",
      "And...",
      "Now unlock the door -",
      "...Harry kept walking...",
      "What do you think you're doing? Go back and get her out of\nthere!",
      "...kept walking...",
      "Save her! What are you doing? She's hurting YOU HAVE TO SAVE\nHER!",
      "The portkey Harry was carrying could transport two humans, only\ntwo, plus or minus a snake. If they'd had Professor Quirrell's\nportkey too... but they didn't, Professor Quirrell's human\nform was carrying that, there was no way to get it... Harry could\nonly save one person today, and there was only one person on the\nlowest level of Azkaban, in the most desperate need...",
      "\"DON'T GO!\" The voice came in a scream from behind the metal\ndoor. \"No, no, no, don't go, don't take it away, don't don't don't\n-\"",
      "There was a light in the corridor and it grew brighter.",
      "\"Please,\" sobbed the woman's voice, \"please, I can't remember my\nchildren's names any more -\"",
      "\"Sit down, Bella,\" Harry's voice said, somehow he kept his voice\nin a cold whisper, \"I must deal with this,\" the Hover Charm\ndiminishing and switching off even as Bella obediently sat down,\nher skeletal form dark against the brightening air.",
      "I'll die, thought Harry.",
      "The air went on brightening.",
      "After all, it wasn't a certainty that Harry would\ndie.",
      "It was just a probability of death, and weren't some things\nworth a probability of dying?",
      "The air went on brightening, the greater Patronus was beginning\nto form around him, the brilliant human shape was becoming\nindistinct within the burning air, as Harry's life went to feed the\nfire.",
      "If I wipe out the Dementors, then even if I live, they'll\nknow it was me, that I was the one who did this... I'll lose my\nsupport, lose the war...",
      "Yeah? said the inner voice that was urging him on.\nAfter you destroy all the Dementors in Azkaban? I'd think\nthat'd tend to prove your credentials as a Light Lord, actually, so\nSAVE HER SAVE HER YOU HAVE TO SAVE HER -",
      "The humanoid shape could no longer be seen as a separate\nentity.",
      "The corridor couldn't be seen.",
      "Harry's own body was invisible within the Cloak.",
      "There was only a bodiless viewpoint within an infinite expanse\nof silver light.",
      "Harry could feel the life leaving him, fueling the spell; far\naway, he could feel the shadows of Death begin to fray.",
      "I meant to accomplish more with my life than this... I was\ngoing to fight the Dark Lord, I was going to merge the wizarding\nand Muggle worlds...",
      "Lofty goals seemed very distant, very abstract, compared to one\nwoman begging him for help, it wasn't certain that Harry\nwould ever do anything more important than this one thing, this one\nthing that he could do now and here.",
      "And with what might have been his last breath, Harry\nthought:",
      "There are other Dementors, probably other Azkabans... if I'm\ngoing to do this, I should do it when I'm closer to the central\npit, it will take less of my life that way, which increases the\nprobability that I'll survive to destroy other Dementors... even\nassuming this is the optimal thing to do, if there's a right time\nand place to do this, it isn't now and here, IT ISN'T NOW AND\nHERE!",
      "What? said the other part of him indignantly, as it\nsearched for a counterargument that didn't exist -",
      "Slowly the light died back down, as Harry concentrated on that\none indisputable fact, the one obvious truth that they weren't in\nthe optimal place, the time couldn't be\nnow...",
      "Slowly the light died back down.",
      "Part of Harry's life flowed back into him.",
      "Part had been lost as radiation.",
      "But Harry had enough left to stay on his feet, and keep the\nsilver human shape bright; and when his wand arm raised and his\nvoice whispered \"Wingardium Leviosa\", the magic flowed obediently\nout of him and helped Bellatrix to her feet. (For it wasn't his\nmagic he had expended, it had never been his magic that fueled the\nPatronus Charm.)",
      "I swear, Harry thought, breathing as regularly as he\ncould in Bellatrix's presence, while tears streamed down his\ninvisible cheeks, I swear upon my life and my magic and my art\nas a rationalist, I swear by everything I hold sacred and all my\nhappy memories, I give my oath that someday I will end this place,\nplease, please may I be forgiven...",
      "And the two of them walked on, as a murderess's voice screamed\nand begged someone to come back and save her.",
      "There should have been more time, there should have been a\nceremony, for Harry's sacrifice of that piece of himself, but\nBellatrix was beside him and so Harry just had to keep on walking\nwithout a pause, saying nothing, breathing evenly.",
      "So Harry walked on, leaving a piece of himself behind. It would\ndwell in this place and time forever, he knew. Even after Harry\ncame back someday with a company of other True Patronus casters and\nthey destroyed all the Dementors here. Even if he melted the\ntriangular building and burned the island low enough that the sea\nwould wash over it, leaving no trace that such a place as this had\never once existed. Even then he wouldn't get it back.",
      "The flock of luminous creatures stopped staring downward, and\nbegan patrolling the metal corridor as if nothing had happened.",
      "\"Just like last time?\" Director Bones snapped in the direction\nof Auror Li, and the young Auror replied, \"Yes, ma'am.\"",
      "The Director fired off another query to see if the Dementors\ncould now find their target, and looked unsurprised to hear a\nnegative reply a few seconds later.",
      "Emmeline Vance was feeling torn between her loyalties.",
      "Emmeline wasn't a member of the Order of the Phoenix any more,\nthey had disbanded after the end of the last war. And during the\nwar, she'd known, they'd all known, that Director Crouch had\nquietly approved of their off-the-books battle.",
      "Director Bones wasn't Crouch.",
      "But they were hunting Bellatrix Black now, who had been a Death\nEater, and who was certainly being rescued by Death Eaters. Their\nPatronuses were behaving oddly - all the bright creatures stopping\nand staring off downward, before they'd gone back to following\ntheir masters. And the Dementors couldn't find their target.",
      "It seemed to her that this would be an extremely good time to\nconsult Albus Dumbledore.",
      "Should she just suggest to Director Bones that they\ncontact Dumbledore? But if Director Bones hadn't contacted him\nalready...",
      "Emmeline wavered for a while, probably too long, and then\nfinally decided. The hell with it, she thought. We're\nall on the same side, we need to stick together whether Director\nBones likes it or not.",
      "At a thought, her silver sparrow fluttered onto her\nshoulder.",
      "\"Drop behind us to guard our rear,\" Emmeline murmured softly,\nalmost without moving her lips, \"wait until no one is looking\ndirectly at you, then go to Albus Dumbledore. If he is not already\nby himself, wait until he is. And tell him this: Bellatrix Black is\nbreaking out of Azkaban, and the Dementors cannot find her.\""

      "Silent, it was thankfully silent, the metal door on the next\nlevel down. Either there wasn't someone behind there, or they were\nhurting quietly, maybe they were screaming but their voice had\ngiven out already, or they were just muttering quietly to\nthemselves in the dark...",
      "I'm not sure I can do this, Harry thought, and he\ncouldn't blame the despairing thought on the Dementors either. It\nwould be better to be lower, safer to be lower, his plan would take\ntime to implement and the Aurors were probably already working\ntheir way down. But if Harry had to pass any more of those metal\ndoors while staying silent and keeping his breathing perfectly\nregular, he might go mad; if he had to leave a piece of himself\nbehind at each one, soon there wouldn't be anything left of him\n-",
      "A luminous moonlit cat leaped into existence and landed in front\nof Harry's Patronus. Harry almost screamed, which wouldn't have\nhelped his image with Bellatrix.",
      "\"Harry!\" said the voice of Professor McGonagall, sounding as\nalarmed as Harry had ever heard from her. \"Where are you? Are you\nall right? This is my Patronus, answer me!\"",
      "With a convulsive effort, Harry cleared his mind, repurposed his\nthroat, forced calm, swapped in a different personality like an\nOcclumency barrier. It took a few seconds and he hoped like hell\nthat Professor McGonagall didn't notice a problem with that thanks\nto the communications delay, just as he hoped like hell that\nPatronuses didn't report on their surroundings.",
      "A young boy's innocent voice said, \"I'm in Mary's Place,\nProfessor, in Diagon Alley. Going to the restroom actually. What's\nwrong?\"",
      "The cat leaped away, and Bellatrix began to chuckle softly,\ndusty appreciative laughter, but she cut herself off abruptly at a\nhiss from Harry.",
      "A moment later the cat returned, and said in Professor\nMcGonagall's voice, \"I'm coming to pick you up right now. Don't go\nanywhere, if you're not around the Defense Professor don't\ngo back to him, don't say anything to anyone, I'll be there as\nquickly as I can!\"",
      "And the bright cat blurred forward and vanished.",
      "Harry glanced down at his watch, noting down the time, so that\nafter he got everyone out of here, and Professor Quirrell anchored\nthe Time-Turner again, he could go back and be in the restroom of\nMary's Place at the appropriate time...",
      "You know, said the problem-solving part of his brain,\nthere's a limit to how many constraints you can add to a\nproblem before it really is impossible, you know\nthat?",
      "It shouldn't have mattered, and it didn't really, it didn't\ncompare to the suffering of a single prisoner in Azkaban, and yet\nHarry still found himself feeling very aware that if his plan\ndidn't end with him being picked up from Mary's Place just like\nhe'd never left, and the Defense Professor looking completely\ninnocent of any and all wrongdoing, Professor McGonagall was going\nto kill him.",
      "As their team prepared to eat another bite of territory out of C\nspiral, shielding and scanning before dispelling the previous\nshield to their rear, Amelia was tapping her fingers on her hip and\nwondering if she ought to consult the obvious expert. If only he\nwasn't so -",
      "Amelia heard the familiar crack of fire and knew what she would\nsee as she turned.",
      "A third of her Aurors were spinning around and leveling their\nwands on the old wizard in half-moon glasses and a long silver\nbeard who had appeared directly within their midst, a bright\nred-golden phoenix on his shoulder.",
      "\"Hold your fire!\" Polyjuice made it easy to forge the face, but\nfaking the phoenix travel would have been rather more difficult -\nthe wards permitted it as one of the fast ways into Azkaban, though\nthere were no fast ways out.",
      "The old witch and the old wizard stared at each other for a long\nmoment.",
      "(Amelia wondered, in the back of her mind, which of her Aurors\nhad sent the word, there were several former members of the Order\nof the Phoenix with her; she tried to remember, in the back of her\nmind, if she'd seen Emmeline's sparrow or Andy's cat missing from\nthe flock of bright creatures; but she knew that it was futile. It\nmight not even be any of her people, for the old meddler often knew\nthings he had no way at all of knowing.)",
      "Albus Dumbledore inclined his head to Amelia in a courteous\ngesture. \"I hope I am not unwelcome here,\" the wizard said calmly.\n\"We are all on the same side, are we not?\"",
      "\"That depends,\" Amelia said in a hard voice. \"Are you here to\nhelp us catch criminals, or to protect them from the consequences\nof their actions?\" Are you going to try to stop the killer of\nmy brother from getting her well-deserved Kiss, old meddler?\nFrom what Amelia heard, Dumbledore had gotten smarter toward the\nend of the war, mostly due to Mad-Eye's nonstop nagging; but had\nrelapsed into his foolish mercies the instant Voldemort's body was\nfound.",
      "A dozen small points of white and silver, reflections of the\nshining animals, gleamed off the old wizard's half-moon glasses as\nhe spoke. \"Even less than you would I see Bellatrix Black freed,\"\nthe old wizard said. \"She must not leave this prison\nalive, Amelia.\"",
      "Before Amelia could speak again, even to express her surprised\ngratification, the old wizard gestured with his long black wand and\na blazing silver phoenix sprang into existence, brighter perhaps\nthan all their other Patronuses put together. It was the first time\nshe'd seen that spell cast wordlessly. \"Order all your Aurors to\ncancel their Patronus Charms for ten seconds,\" said the old wizard.\n\"What darkness cannot find, the light may.\"",
      "Amelia snapped off the order to the communications officer, who\nwould notify all Aurors through their mirrors, commanding\nDumbledore's will to be done.",
      "That took a few moments, and it became a period of awful\nsilence, none of the Aurors daring to speak, while Amelia tried to\nweigh her own thoughts. She must not leave this prison\nalive... Albus Dumbledore wouldn't turn into Bartemius Crouch\nwithout a strong reason. If he'd meant to tell her why, he\nalready would have; but it certainly wasn't a positive sign.",
      "Still, it was good to know they'd be able to work together on\nthis one.",
      "\"Now,\" said a chorus of mirrors, and all the Patronus Charms\nwinked out except that blazing silver phoenix.",
      "\"Is there another Patronus still present?\" the old wizard said\nclearly to the bright creature.",
      "The bright creature dipped its head in a nod.",
      "\"Can you find it?\"",
      "The silver head nodded again.",
      "\"Will you remember it, should it depart and come again?\"",
      "A final nod from the blazing phoenix.",
      "\"It is done,\" Dumbledore said.",
      "\"Over,\" said all the mirrors a moment later, and Amelia raised\nher wand and began recasting her own Patronus. (Though it took some\nextra concentration, with that wolfish smile already on her face,\nto think of the first time Susan had kissed her cheek, instead of\ndwelling on the looming fate of Bellatrix Black. That other Kiss\nwas a happy thought indeed, but not quite the right kind for the\nPatronus Charm.)",
      "They hadn't even gotten to the end of that corridor before\nHarry's Patronus raised its hand, politely, as though in a\nclassroom.",
      "Harry thought quickly. The question was how to - no, that was\nalso obvious.",
      "\"It seems,\" Harry said in a coldly amused voice, \"that someone\nhas instructed this Patronus to speak its message only to me.\" He\nchuckled. \"Well then. Pardon me, dear Bella. Quietus.\"",
      "At once the silver humanoid said in Harry's own voice, \"There is\nanother Patronus which seeks this Patronus.\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" said Harry. And then, without pausing to think\nabout what was happening, \"Can you block it? Stop it from finding\nyou?\"",
      "The silver humanoid shook its head.",
      "No sooner did Amelia and the other Aurors finish recasting their\nPatronus Charms, when -",
      "The blazing silver phoenix flew off, and the true red-golden\nphoenix followed it, and the old wizard calmly strode after both of\nthem with his long wand gripped low.",
      "The shields around their territory parted around the old wizard\nlike water, and closed behind him with hardly a ripple.",
      "\"Albus!\u202f\" shouted Amelia. \"What do you think you're\ndoing?\"",
      "But she already knew.",
      "\"Do not follow me,\" the old wizard's voice said sternly. \"I can\nprotect myself, I cannot protect others.\"",
      "The curse Amelia shouted after him made even her own Aurors\nflinch.",
      "This isn't fair, isn't fair, isn't fair! There's a limit to\nhow many constraints you can add to a problem before it really is\nimpossible!",
      "Harry blocked off the useless thoughts, ignored the fatigue he\nwas feeling, and forced his mind to confront the new requirements,\nhe had to think fast, use the adrenaline on following the\nchains of logic quickly and without hesitation, instead of wasting\nit on despair.",
      "For the mission to succeed,",
      "(1) Harry would have to dispel his Patronus.",
      "(2) Bellatrix needed to be hidden from the Dementors after the\nPatronus was dispelled.",
      "(3) Harry needed to resist the Dementors' drain after his\nPatronus was dispelled.",
      "...",
      "If I solve this one, said Harry's brain, I want a\ncookie afterward, and if you make the problem any more difficult\nthan this, I mean the slightest bit more difficult, I am climbing\nout of your skull and heading for Tahiti.",
      "Harry and his brain considered the problem.",
      "Azkaban had stood invincible for centuries, relying upon the\nimpossibility of evading the Dementors' gaze. So if Harry found\nanother way to hide Bellatrix from the Dementors, it would\nrely on either his scientific knowledge or his realization that the\nDementors were Death.",
      "Harry's brain suggested that an obvious way to stop the\nDementors from seeing Bellatrix was to make her stop existing,\ni.e., kill her.",
      "Harry congratulated his brain on thinking outside the box and\ntold it to continue searching.",
      "Kill her and then bring her back, came the next\nsuggestion. Use Frigideiro to cool Bellatrix down to the point\nwhere her brain activity stops, then warm her up afterward using\nThermos, just like people who fall into very cold water can be\nsuccessfully revived half-an-hour later without noticeable brain\ndamage.",
      "Harry considered this. Bellatrix might not survive in her\ndebilitated state. And it might not stop Death from seeing\nher. And he'd have trouble carrying a cold unconscious\nBellatrix very far. And Harry couldn't remember the\nresearch on which exact body temperature was supposed to be\nnonfatal but temporarily-brain-halting.",
      "It was another good outside-the-box idea, but Harry told his\nbrain to keep thinking of...",
      "...ways to hide from Death...",
      "A frown moved over Harry's face. He'd heard something about\nthat, somewhere.",
      "One of the requisites for becoming a powerful wizard is an\nexcellent memory, Professor Quirrell had said. The key to\na puzzle is often something you read twenty years ago in an old\nscroll, or a peculiar ring you saw on the finger of a man you met\nonly once...",
      "Harry focused as hard as he could, but he couldn't remember, it\nwas on the tip of his tongue but he couldn't remember; so he told\nhis subconscious to go on trying to recollect it, and refocused his\nattention on the other half of the problem.",
      "How can I protect myself from the Dementors without a\nPatronus Charm?",
      "The Headmaster had been repeatedly exposed to a Dementor from a\nfew steps away, over and over throughout a whole day, and had come\nout of it looking merely tired. How had the Headmaster done that?\nCould Harry do it too?",
      "It could just be some random genetic thing, in which case Harry\nwas screwed. But assuming the problem was solvable...",
      "Then the obvious answer was that Dumbledore wasn't afraid of\ndeath.",
      "Dumbledore really wasn't afraid of death. Dumbledore\nhonestly, truly believed that death was the next great adventure.\nBelieved it in his core, not just as convenient words used to\nsuppress cognitive dissonance, not just pretending to be wise.\nDumbledore had decided that death was the natural and normative\norder, and whatever tiny lingering fear was still in him, it had\ntaken a long time and repeated exposures for the Dementor to drain\nhim through that small flaw.",
      "That avenue was closed to Harry.",
      "And then Harry thought of the flip side, the obvious inverse\nquestion:",
      "Why am I so much more vulnerable than average? Other\nstudents didn't fall over when they faced the Dementor.",
      "Harry meant to destroy Death, to end it if he could. He meant to\nlive forever, if he could; he had hope of it, the thought of Death\nbrought him no sense of despair or inevitability. He was not\nblindly attached to his own life; indeed it had taken an effort\nnot to burn away all his life on the need to protect\nothers from Death. Why did the shadows of Death have such power\nover Harry? He would not have thought himself so afraid.",
      "Was it Harry, all along, who'd been rationalizing? Who was\nsecretly so afraid of death that it was twisting his own thoughts,\nas Harry had accused Dumbledore?",
      "Harry considered this, preventing himself from flinching away.\nIt felt uncomfortable, but...",
      "But...",
      "But uncomfortable thoughts weren't always true, and\nthis one didn't sound exactly right. Like there was a grain of\ntruth, but it wasn't hiding where the hypothesis said it\nwas -",
      "And that was when Harry realized.",
      "Oh.",
      "Oh, I understand now.",
      "The one who is afraid, is...",
      "Harry asked his dark side what it thought of death.",
      "And Harry's Patronus wavered, dimmed, almost went out upon the\ninstant, for that desperate, sobbing, screaming terror, an\nunutterable fear that would do anything not to die, throw\neverything aside not to die, that couldn't think straight or feel\nstraight in the presence of that absolute horror, that couldn't\nlook into the abyss of nonexistence any more than it could have\nstared straight into the Sun, a blind terrified thing that only\nwanted to find a dark corner and hide and not have to think about\nit any more -",
      "The silver figure had darkened to moonlight, was flickering like\na failing candle -",
      "It's all right, thought Harry, it's all\nright.",
      "Visualizing himself cradling his dark side like a frightened\nchild in his arms.",
      "It's right and proper to be horrified, because death is\nhorrible. You don't have to hide your horror, you don't have to\nfeel ashamed of it, you can wear it as a badge of honor, openly in\nthe Sun.",
      "It was strange, to feel himself split in two like this, the\ntrack of his thoughts that gave the comfort, the track of his\nthoughts that followed his dark side's incomprehension at the\nalienness of the ordinary Harry's thoughts; of all the things that\nhis dark side associated with its own fear of death, the one thing\nit had never expected or imagined that it might find, was\nacceptance and praise and help...",
      "You don't have to fight alone, Harry said silently to\nhis dark side. The rest of me will back you up on this. I won't\nlet myself die, and I won't let my friends die either. Not you/I,\nnot Hermione, not Mum or Dad, not Neville or Draco or anyone, this\nis the will to protect... Visualizing wings of sunlight, like\nthe wings of the Patronus he had spread, to give shelter to that\nfrightened child.",
      "The Patronus brightened again, the world spun around Harry or it\nwas his own mind that was spinning?",
      "Take my hand, Harry thought and visualized, come\nwith me, and we will do this thing together...",
      "There was a lurch in Harry's mind, like his brain had taken one\nstep to the left, or the universe had taken one step to the\nright.",
      "And in a brightly lit corridor in Azkaban, the dim gas lights\nfar outshone by the steady and unwavering light of a human-shaped\nPatronus, an invisible boy stood with a strange small smile on his\nface, shaking only slightly.",
      "Harry knew, somehow, that he'd just done something significant,\nsomething that went beyond just strengthening his resistance to\nDementors.",
      "And more than that, he'd remembered. Thinking of Death\nas an anthropomorphic figure had done the trick, ironically enough.\nNow Harry could remember it, what was reputed to hide someone from\nthe gaze of Death himself...",
      "In a corridor of Azkaban, a wizard's striding legs came to an\nabrupt halt; for the bright silver thing that was his guide, had\nhalted in midair, fluttering its wings in distress. The brilliant\nwhite phoenix craned its head, looking backward and forward as\nthough confused; and then it turned to its master and shook its\nhead in apology.",
      "Without another word, the old wizard turned and strode back the\nway he came.",
      "Harry stood straight and upright, feeling the fear wash over him\nand around him. Some tiny part of him might have been eroded a\nlittle by the waves of emptiness that broke continually upon his\nunmoving stone, but his limbs were not cold, and his magic was with\nhim. In time those waves might corrode him and consume him,\nsneaking through whatever tiny part of him still cowered before\nDeath instead of using its fear to energize itself for battle. But\nthat doom would take time, with the shadows of Death far away and\nuncaring of him. The flaw, the crack, the fault-line that was in\nhim had been repaired, and the stars blazed brightly in his mind,\nvast and unafraid, and brilliant in the midst of cold and\ndarkness.",
      "To anyone else's eyes, it would have seemed that the boy stood\nalone in the dimly lit metal corridor, wearing that strange\nsmile.",
      "For Bellatrix Black and the snake draped around her shoulders\nwere concealed by the Cloak of Invisibility, one of the three\nDeathly Hallows and reputed to hide its wearer from the gaze of\nDeath himself. The riddle whose answer had been lost, and which\nHarry had found anew.",
      "And Harry knew, now, that the concealment of the Cloak was more\nthan the mere transparency of Disillusionment, that the Cloak kept\nyou hidden and not just invisible, as unseeable as were\nThestrals to the unknowing. And Harry also knew that it was\nThestral blood which painted the symbol of the Deathly Hallows on\nthe inside of the Cloak, binding into the Cloak that portion of\nDeath's power, enabling the Cloak to confront the Dementors on\ntheir own level and block them. It had felt like guessing, and yet\na certain guess, the knowledge coming to him in the instant of\nsolving the riddle.",
      "Bellatrix was still transparent within the Cloak, but to Harry\nshe was no longer hidden, he knew that she was there, as obvious to\nhim as a Thestral. For Harry had only loaned his Cloak, not given\nit; and he had comprehended and mastered the Deathly Hallow that\nhad been passed down through the Potter line.",
      "Harry gazed directly at the invisible woman, and said, \"Can the\nDementors reach you, Bella?\"",
      "\"No,\" said the woman in a soft, wondering voice. Then, \"But my\nLord... you...\"",
      "\"If you say anything foolish, it will annoy me,\" Harry said\ncoldly. \"Or are you under the impression that I would sacrifice\nmyself for you?\"",
      "\"No, my Lord,\" the Dark Lord's servant replied, sounding\npuzzled, and perhaps awed.",
      "\"Follow,\" spoke Harry's cold whisper.",
      "And they continued their journey downward, as the Dark Lord\nreached into his pouch, and took a cookie, and ate it. If Bellatrix\nhad asked, Harry would have claimed it was for the chocolate, but\nshe didn't ask.",
      "The old wizard strode back into the midst of the Aurors, the\nsilver and the red-golden phoenixes now following behind.",
      "\"You -\" Amelia began to bellow.",
      "\"They have dismissed their Patronus,\" said Dumbledore. The old\nwizard didn't seem to raise his voice but his calm words somehow\noverrode her own. \"I cannot find them now.\"",
      "Amelia gritted her teeth, and put a number of scathing remarks\non hold, and turned to the communications officer. \"Tell the duty\nroom to ask the Dementors again if they can sense\nBellatrix Black.\"",
      "The communications specialist spoke to her mirror for a moment,\nand a few seconds later, looked up, surprised. \"No -\"",
      "Amelia was already cursing violently in her mind.",
      "\"- but they can see someone else on the lower levels who isn't a\nprisoner.\"",
      "\"Fine!\" snapped Amelia. \"Tell the Dementor that a dozen of its\nkind are authorized to enter Azkaban and seize whoever that is and\nanyone in their company! And if they see Bellatrix Black, they're\nto Kiss her immediately!\"",
      "Amelia turned and glared toward Dumbledore, then, daring him to\nargue; but the old wizard only looked at her a bit sadly, and held\nhis peace.",
      "Auror McCusker finished speaking to the corpse that drifted\noutside the window, conveying the Director's orders.",
      "The corpse gave him a deathly smile that almost unstrung his\nlimbs, and then floated downward.",
      "Soon after, a dozen Dementors arose from where they had drifted\nin the central pit of Azkaban, and headed outward, toward the walls\nof the vast metal structure that towered above them.",
      "Entering through holes set into the base of Azkaban, the darkest\nof all creatures began their march of horror."

      "Harry had hoped that he'd just achieved fusion with his\nmysterious dark side and would be enabled to draw on all of its\nbenefits with none of its drawbacks, call up the crystal clarity\nand indomitable will on demand, without needing to go cold or\nangry.",
      "Once again, he'd overestimated how much progress he'd made.\nSomething had happened, but Harry still had a mysterious\ndark side, it was still separate from him, and his ordinary self\nwas still domitable. And despite the repair work he'd done on his\ndark side's fear of death, he didn't dare go dark while unshielded\nin Azkaban, that was tempting fate way too much.",
      "Which was unfortunate, because a bit of nondomitability would\nhave sure come in handy about now.",
      "What made it harder was that he couldn't slump against a wall,\ncouldn't break into tears, couldn't even heave a sigh. His dear\nBella was watching him and that wasn't the sort of thing her Dark\nLord would do.",
      "\"My Lord -\" Bellatrix said. Her low voice was strained. \"The\nDementors - they are coming - I can feel them, my Lord -\"",
      "\"Thank you, Bella,\" said a dry voice, \"I already know that.\"",
      "Harry couldn't sense the holes in the world the same way as when\nhe'd been wearing the Deathly Hallow, but he could feel the empty\npull increasing in intensity. At first he'd mistaken it for the\nresult of descending a stairwell, until he and Bellatrix had\nfinished descending and the pull had gone on increasing. Then\ndecreased, as the Dementors moved away along the spiral, then\nincreased as they went up another flight of stairs... There were\nDementors within Azkaban itself now, and they were coming for him.\nOf course they were. Harry might be resistant now, but he was not\nhidden.",
      "New requirement, Harry told his brain. Find a way\nof defeating Dementors that doesn't invoke my Patronus Charm.\nAlternatively, find yet another way of hiding someone from\nDementors, besides the Cloak of Invisibility -",
      "I quit, said his brain. Find yourself another piece\nof computing substrate to solve your ridiculously overconstrained\nproblems.",
      "I mean it, thought Harry.",
      "So do I, said his brain. Put up your Patronus Charm\nand wait for the Aurors to find you. Be sensible. It's\nover.",
      "Give up...",
      "The sucking emptiness seemed to pull harder, as he thought it;\nand Harry realized what was happening, concentrated more intensely\non the stars, turned his mind away from the despair -",
      "You know, observed the logical side of him, if\nyou're not allowed to think any negative thoughts because\nthat will open your mind to the Dementors, that's a\ncognitive bias too, how would you know if it actually was\ntime to give up?",
      "A desperate sobbing scream rose up from below, words mixed in\nlike \"no\" and \"away\". The prisoners knew, the prisoners could feel\nit.",
      "The Dementors were coming.",
      "\"My Lord, you - you should not risk yourself for me - take back\nyour Cloak -\"",
      "\"Be silent, fool,\" hissed an angry voice. \"When I decide to\nsacrifice you I will tell you so.\"",
      "She's got a valid point, said Slytherin. You\nshouldn't risk yourself for her, there's no way her life is as\nvaluable as yours.",
      "For an instant Harry considered sacrificing Bellatrix to save\nhimself -",
      "And in that moment, some of the dim orange gas-light seemed to\nflee the corridor, a touch of cold crept over Harry's fingertips.\nAnd he knew, then, that to think of leaving Bellatrix to the\nshadows of Death, would make him vulnerable once more. Even in the\nmoment of making the decision, he might become unable to cast the\nPatronus Charm, for he would have given up the thought that had\nsaved him before.",
      "It occurred to Harry that he could still take the Cloak from\nBellatrix afterward, even if he couldn't cast the Patronus Charm;\nand then he had to wrench his thoughts away from that option, focus\nfirmly on his decision not to do it, or he might have just\nfallen over where he stood. For the whirlpool of emptiness swirling\naround him was now deadly strong; there were screams coming from\nabove, and the screams below had stopped.",
      "This is ridiculous, said his logical side. Rational\nagents shouldn't have to put up with this sort of censored\nreasoning process, all the theorems assume that how you think\ndoesn't affect reality apart from your actual actions, which is why\nyou're free to choose an optimal algorithm without worrying about\nhow your thoughts interact with Dementors -",
      "...",
      "That is a really dumb idea, said Gryffindor. Even I\nthink it's a dumb idea and I'm your Gryffindor side. You're not\nseriously going to just stand there and -",
      "\"We have a fix!\" shouted Ora, holding up her magic mirror as\nthough in triumph. \"The Dementor outside the inner wall pointed to\nlevel seven, C spiral, that's where they are!\"",
      "Her Aurors were looking at her expectantly.",
      "\"No,\" Amelia said in a level voice. \"That's where one\nof them is. The Dementors still can't find Bellatrix Black. We are\nnot running down there and letting her through in the confusion,\nand we are not dividing our forces to be ambushed. So long as we\nmove with caution, we can't lose. Tell Scrimgeour and Shacklebolt\nto keep going down level by level, same as before -\"",
      "The old wizard was already striding forward. Amelia didn't even\nbother cursing him, this time, as once again their carefully\nconstructed shields parted like water and rippled gently in his\nwake.",
      "Harry waited at the beginning of the corridor, just next to the\nstairs leading upward. Bellatrix and the snake were behind him,\nconcealed by the Deathly Hallow that Harry had mastered; he knew,\nthough he could not see, that the emaciated sorceress was sitting\nupon the stairs, slumped back, since Harry had withdrawn his Hover\nCharm to free up his mind and magic.",
      "Harry's eyes were fixed on the far end of the corridor, next to\nthe stairs that led downward. Not in his mind now, but in true\nreality, the light in the corridor had dimmed, the temperature had\nfallen. The fear thundered over him and around him like a sea\nwhipped by hurricane winds, and the sucking emptiness had become a\nhowling draw toward some approaching black hole.",
      "Up the stairs at the far end, floating smoothly through the\ndying air, came the voids, the absences, the wounds in the\nworld.",
      "And Harry expected them to stop.",
      "With all the will and focus he could muster, Harry expected\nthem to stop.",
      "Anticipated their stopping.",
      "Believed they would stop.",
      "...that was the idea, anyway...",
      "Harry shut down the dangerous stray thought, and expected\nthe Dementors to halt. They had no intelligence of their own,\nthey were just wounds in the world, their form and structure was\nborrowed from others' expectations. People had been able to\nnegotiate with them, offer them victims in exchange for\ncooperation, only because they believed Dementors would\nbargain. So if Harry believed hard enough that the voids would\nturn and go, they would turn and go.",
      "But the wounds in the world kept coming, the swirling fear\nseemed like a solid thing now, the emptiness tearing at matter as\nwell as mind, substance as well as spirit, you could see the metal\nbeginning to tarnish as the holes in the world passed.",
      "A small sound came from behind him, from Bellatrix, but she said\nno word, for she had been instructed to remain silent.",
      "Don't think of them as creatures, think of them as\npsychosensitive objects, they can be controlled if I can control\nmyself -",
      "The problem was that he couldn't control himself so\neasily, couldn't make himself believe blue was green by an act of\nwill. Couldn't suppress all those thoughts about how irrational it\nwas to make yourself believe something. How\nimpossible it was to trick yourself into believing\nsomething if you knew that was what you were doing. All\nthe training Harry had given himself against self-deception was\nrefusing to switch off no matter how harmful it was in this\nunique special case -",
      "The shadows of Death crossed the halfway point of the corridor,\nand Harry held up his hand, fingers spread, and said in a voice of\nfirm and confident command, \"Stop.\"",
      "The shadows of Death stopped.",
      "Behind Harry, Bellatrix gave a strangled gasp, like it was being\ntorn out of her.",
      "Harry gestured to her, the signal he had set up in advance which\nmeant, repeat what you heard the Dementors say.",
      "\"They say,\" Bellatrix said, her voice was shaking, \"they said,\n'Bellatrix Black was promised us. Tell us where she hides, and you\nwill be spared.'\"",
      "\"Bellatrix?\" Harry said, making his voice sound amused. \"She\nescaped a while ago.\"",
      "A moment later, Harry realized that he should have said that\nBellatrix was among the Aurors in the top level, that would have\ncaused more confusion -",
      "No, it was wrong to think of the Dementors as trickable, they\nwere merely things, they were controlled only by\nexpectations -",
      "\"They say,\" Bellatrix said in a cracked voice, \"they say they\nknow you're lying.\"",
      "The voids began to move forward again.",
      "Her anticipations are more solidly believed than mine; she\nis controlling them, unwittingly -",
      "\"Don't resist,\" Harry said, pointing his wand behind him.",
      "\"I, I love you, farewell, my Lord -\"",
      "\"Somnium.\"",
      "It had helped, strangely enough, hearing those particular awful\nwords, understanding Bellatrix's mistake; it reminded Harry why he\nwas fighting.",
      "\"Stop,\" Harry said again. Bellatrix was asleep; now only his own\nwill, his own expectations rather, should control those spheres of\nannihilation -",
      "But they kept on gliding forward, and Harry couldn't stop\nhimself from worrying that the previous experience had damaged his\nconfidence, which meant that he wouldn't be able to stop\nthem, and as he noticed himself thinking that, he doubted even more\n- he needed more time to prepare, really ought to practice\ncontrolling just one Dementor in a cage first -",
      "There was only a quarter of corridor now between Harry and the\nshadows of death, the empty winds were so strong that Harry could\nfeel the erosion beginning in the cracks of himself.",
      "And the thought came to Harry that maybe he was wrong, maybe\nDementors did have their own desires and planning\ncapability. Or maybe they were controlled by how everyone\nthought they worked, not just whoever was closest to them. And in\neither case -",
      "Harry drew up his wand into the starting position for the\nPatronus Charm, and spoke.",
      "\"One of your number went to Hogwarts and did not return. It no\nlonger exists; that Death is dead.\"",
      "The Dementors halted, a dozen wounds in the world stood\nmotionless, while the emptiness screamed around them like a deadly\nwind to nowhere.",
      "\"Turn and go and do not speak of this to anyone, little shadows,\nor I will destroy you as well.\"",
      "Harry's fingers slid into the starting position for the Patronus\nCharm, and readied himself to cast it; in his mind, the Earth shone\namong the stars, the day side bright and blue with reflected\nsunlight, the night side glimmering with the light of human cities.\nHarry wasn't bluffing, wasn't trying to do anything tricky with his\nthoughts. The shadows of Death would move forward and be\nannihilated, or they would depart, he was equally ready for\neither...",
      "And the voids retreated back as smoothly as they came, the winds\nof nothingness lessening with each meter they traversed, as they\nslid back down the stairs, and departed.",
      "Whether they truly had their own pseudo-intelligence, or whether\nHarry had finally succeeded in expecting them to go...\nthat, Harry didn't know.",
      "But they were gone.",
      "Harry took a moment to sit down beside the unconscious Bellatrix\non the stairs, and slumped down as she was slumped, closing his\neyes for a moment, only a moment, he sure as hell wasn't planning\nto sleep in Azkaban, but he needed to take that moment. The Aurors\nwould still be going down the stairs slowly, Harry hoped, so it\nwouldn't hurt to take just five minutes to rest. Harry was careful\nto keep his thoughts positive, cheerful, my, I'll just have\nsome nice regenerative rest here, and then I'll feel better,\nrather than, say, my, I'll just collapse in emotional and\nphysical exhaustion, because the Dementors hadn't yet\nretreated very far.",
      "And by the way, Harry said to his brain, you're\nfired.",
      "\"I found him!\" cried the old wizard's voice.",
      "Who? thought Amelia, as she turned to see Dumbledore's\nreturn, carrying in his arms -",
      "- the one sight, the one person, she would never have expected\nto behold -",
      "- a man in torn red robes, looking scorched like he'd fought a\nsmall war, blood dried on many cuts. His eyes were open, and he was\nchewing on a bar of chocolate, held in his one living hand.",
      "Bahry One-Hand was alive.",
      "A glad cry went up, her Aurors lowering their wands, some of\nthem already starting to rush forward.",
      "\"Stay on guard!\u202f\" bellowed Amelia. \"Check them both for\nPolyjuice - scan Bahry for small Animagi or traps -\"",
      "\"Innervate. Wingardium Leviosa.\"",
      "There was a pause. Harry sensed, though he could not quite see,\nthat the invisible woman was pushing herself to her feet, and\nturning her head to look around. \"I'm... alive...?\"",
      "Harry was sorely tempted to say no, just to see what she made of\nthat. Instead he hissed, \"Don't ask stupid questions.\"",
      "\"What happened?\" whispered Bellatrix.",
      "And the Dark Lord gave a wild, high-pitched laugh, and said, \"I\nscared the Dementors away, my dear Bella.\"",
      "There was a pause. Harry wished he could see Bellatrix's face;\nhad he said the wrong thing?",
      "After a time, in a quavering voice, \"Could it be, my Lord, that\nin your new form, you have begun to care for me -\"",
      "\"No,\" Harry said coldly, and turned from her (though he kept his\nwand on her), and began walking. \"And take care that you do not\noffend me again, or I will abandon you here, use or no use. Now\nfollow, or be left behind; I have work to do.\"",
      "Harry strode forward, not listening to the gasping sounds that\ncame from behind him; he knew Bellatrix was following.",
      "...because the last thing that woman needed, the very last thing\nshe needed to start thinking before the psychiatric healer began\ntrying to deprogram her, was to believe that her Dark Lord could\never love her back.",
      "The old wizard smoothed his silver beard contemplatively,\nlooking at where Auror Bahry was being carried out of the room by\ntwo strong Aurors.",
      "\"Do you understand this, Amelia?\"",
      "\"No,\" she said simply. She suspected some trap they hadn't yet\nbeen able to fathom, which was why Auror Bahry was going to be kept\noutside the main party and guarded.",
      "\"Perhaps,\" the old wizard said at length, \"whichever of their\nnumber can cast the Patronus Charm, is more than a simple hostage.\nSomeone who was tricked into this, mayhap? For whatever reason,\nthey left your Auror alive; let us not be the first to wield deadly\ncurses, when we find them -\"",
      "\"I see,\" said the old witch in sudden realization,\n\"that was their plan. It costs them nothing to Oblivate\nhim and leave him alive, and makes us hesitate -\" Amelia\nnodded decisively, and said to her people, \"We carry on as\nbefore.\"",
      "The old wizard sighed. \"Any news from the Dementors?\"",
      "\"If I tell you,\" Amelia snapped, \"will you run off again?\"",
      "\"It costs you nothing, Amelia,\" the old wizard said quietly,\n\"and may save one of your own people the fight.\"",
      "Costs me nothing except my chance at vengeance -",
      "But that was nothing compared to the other, the annoying old\nwizard was often right in the end, it was part of what made him so\nannoying.",
      "\"The Dementors have ceased to answer questions about the other\nperson they said they saw,\" Amelia told him, \"and they will not say\nwhy, nor where.\"",
      "Dumbledore turned to the blazing silver phoenix on his shoulder,\nwhose light illuminated the whole corridor, and received a silent\nheadshake in reply. \"I cannot detect them either,\" said Dumbledore.\nThen he shrugged. \"I suppose I shall just walk the whole spiral\nfrom top to bottom and see if anything turns up, shall I?\"",
      "Amelia would have ordered him not to do it, if she thought that\nwould have made the tiniest difference.",
      "\"Albus,\" said Amelia as the old wizard turned to depart, \"even\nyou can be ambushed.\"",
      "\"Nonsense, my dear,\" the old wizard said cheerfully as he strode\noff yet again, waving as though in admonition his fifteen-inch wand\nof unidentifiable dark-grey wood, \"I'm invincible.\"",
      "There was a pause.",
      "(\"He didn't just really say that -\" whispered the newest Auror\npresent, a still-prim young lady by the name of Noelle Curry, to\nthe senior member of her trio, Auror Brooks. \"Did he?\")",
      "(\"He can get away with it,\" Isabel whispered back to her, \"he's\nDumbledore, not even Fate takes him seriously\nanymore.\")",
      "\"And that,\" Amelia said heavily, for the benefit of the younger\nAurors, \"is why we never call him in on anything unless we\nabsolutely must.\"",
      "Harry lay very still on the hard bench that served as the bed of\nthis cell, a blanket pulled over him, staying as absolutely\nmotionless as he could while he waited for the fear to return.\nThere was a Patronus approaching, and a powerful one. Bellatrix was\nhidden by a Deathly Hallow, no easy Charm would penetrate that; but\nHarry did not know what other arts the Aurors might employ to\ndetect his own self, and dared not reveal his ignorance by asking\nher. So Harry lay on a hard bed, in a cell with a locked door, and\nthe mighty metal door locked behind him, in absolute darkness, with\na thin blanket pulled over him, hoping that whoever it was wouldn't\nlook in, or wouldn't look too closely if they did -",
      "That wasn't a point Harry could affect, really, that part of his\nfate lay entirely in the hands of the Hidden Variables. Most of his\nmind was concentrating on the ongoing Transfiguration he was\nperforming.",
      "Listening in the silence, Harry heard the quick footsteps\napproach; they paused outside his door, and then -",
      "- continued onward.",
      "Soon the fear returned.",
      "Harry didn't allow himself to notice his own relief, any more\nthan he allowed himself to notice the fear. He was holding in his\nmind the form of a Muggle device rather larger than a car battery,\nand slowly applying that Form to the substance of an ice cube\n(which Harry had frozen using Frigideiro on water from a\nbottle in his pouch). You weren't supposed to Transfigure things to\nbe burned, but between the original substance being water, and the\nBubble-Head Charm to protect their air supply, Harry hoped that\nthis wouldn't make him or anyone else sick.",
      "Now it was just a question of whether there would be enough time\nbefore the Aurors did a detailed check on this cell block, for\nHarry to finish this Transfiguration, and the partial\nTransfiguration he would do after that -",
      "When the old wizard strode back empty-handed, even Amelia began\nto feel a twinge of worry. She and the other two Auror teams had\nworked a third of the way down the three spirals, in synchrony so\nas not to allow any gap in their coverage that could be jumped by\ncutting through a ceiling, and they'd yet to find any sign.",
      "\"Might I ask you to report?\" Amelia said, keeping the edge out\nof her voice.",
      "\"First a simple walk from top to bottom,\" said the old wizard.\nHe was frowning, wrinkling his face even more than usual. \"I\nexamined Bellatrix's cell, and found a death doll left in her\nplace. This escape was meant to go unremarked, I think. There is\nsomething hidden in the corner beneath a scrap of cloth; I left\nthat undisturbed for your Aurors to examine. On the return trip, I\nopened each door and looked within the cells. I saw nothing\nDisillusioned, only the prisoners -\"",
      "They were interrupted by a scream from the red-golden phoenix,\nand all her Aurors flinched from it. Condemnation was in it, and an\nurgent demand that almost started Amelia running from the corridor\non the spot.",
      "\"- in rather distressing condition,\" Dumbledore said quietly.\nFor a moment the blue eyes were very cold beneath the half-moon\nglasses. \"Will any of you speak to me of the consequences of their\nactions?\"",
      "\"I did not -\" Amelia began.",
      "\"I know,\" said the old wizard. \"My apologies, Amelia.\" He\nsighed. \"Some of the more recent prisoners had scraps of their\nmagic left, when I looked upon them, but I sensed no uneaten power;\nthe strongest had only as much magic left as a first-year child. I\nheard Fawkes scream in distress many times, but never challenge. It\nseems you shall have to continue your search; they can hide well\nenough to escape my mere glance.\"",
      "When Harry finished his first Transfiguration, he sat up, pulled\nback the blanket that had covered him, cast a quick Lumos,\nglanced at his watch, and was shocked to see that nearly an hour\nand thirty minutes had passed. How much of that time had gone by\nsince someone had opened the door and then closed it again - Harry\nhadn't been looking in that direction, of course - that, Harry\ncouldn't guess.",
      "\"My Lord...?\" whispered Bellatrix's voice, soft and very\ntentative.",
      "\"You may speak now,\" Harry said. He'd told her to remain silent\nwhile he worked.",
      "\"That was Dumbledore who looked upon us.\"",
      "Pause.",
      "\"Interesting,\" Harry said neutrally. He was glad he had not\nnoticed this at the time. That sounded like a rather close\nshave.",
      "Harry said a word to his pouch, and began drawing forth the\nmagical device that he would mate to the product of his hour's\nlabor. Then, when that was drawn forth, another word brought forth\na tube of industrial-strength glue; before using it, Harry cast the\nBubble-Head Charm on himself and Bellatrix, and had Bellatrix cast\nthe same Charm on the snake, so that the glue fumes in the enclosed\ncell would not harm them.",
      "When the glue had begun to set, binding technology to magic,\nHarry laid it down upon the bed, and sat down on the floor, resting\nhis magic and will for a moment before essaying the next\nTransfiguration.",
      "\"My Lord...\" Bellatrix said hesitantly.",
      "\"Yes?\" said the dry voice.",
      "\"What is that device you made?\"",
      "Harry thought rapidly. It seemed like a good chance to check his\nplans with her, under the guise of leading questions.",
      "\"Consider, my dear Bella,\" said Harry smoothly. \"How difficult\nis it for a powerful wizard to cut the walls of Azkaban?\"",
      "There was a pause, and then Bellatrix's voice came, slow and\npuzzled, \"Not difficult at all, my Lord...?\"",
      "\"Indeed,\" said the dry, high voice of Bella's master. \"Suppose\none were to do this, and fly through the hole on a broomstick, and\nsoar up and away. Rescuing a prisoner from Azkaban would seem easy\nthen, would it not?\"",
      "\"But my Lord...\" said Bella. \"The Aurors would - they have their\nown broomsticks, my Lord, fast ones -\"",
      "Harry listened, it was as he had thought. The Dark Lord replied,\nagain in tones of smoothly Socratic inquiry, and Bellatrix asked a\nfurther question, which Harry had not expected, but Harry's own\ncounterquestion showed that it should not matter in the end. And in\nresponse to Bellatrix's last question, the Dark Lord only smiled,\nand said that it was time for him to resume his work.",
      "And then Harry got up from the floor of the cell, went to the\nfar end of the cells, and touched his wand to the hard surface of\nthe wall - the wall of Azkaban, the solid metal that separated them\nfrom direct exposure to the Dementors' pit.",
      "And Harry began a partial Transfiguration.",
      "This spell would go faster, Harry hoped. He'd spent hours and\nhours practicing the unique magic, which had made it routine, not\nmuch more difficult for him than ordinary Transfiguration. The\nshape he was changing had not all that much total volume, the\nTransfigured shape might be tall and wide and long, but it was very\nthin. Half a millimeter, Harry had thought, would be enough,\nconsidering the perfect smoothness...",
      "On the long bench that served as a prison bed, where Harry had\nset down the Transfigured technological device and the mated magic\nitem for the glue to dry, tiny letters in golden script gleamed on\nthe Muggle artifact. Harry hadn't really planned for them\nto be there, but they'd kept running through the back of his mind,\nand so seemed to have become part of the Transfigured form.",
      "There were many different things Harry could have said before\nusing this particular triumph of technological ingenuity. Any\nnumber of things that would be, in one sense or another,\nappropriate. Or at least things that Harry could have\nsaid, would have said, if Bellatrix had not been\nthere.",
      "But there was only one thing to say, that Harry would only get\nthe chance to say just this once, and probably never get a better\nchance to say ever again. (Or think, anyway, if he\ncouldn't say it.) He hadn't seen the actual movie, but he'd seen a\npreview, and for some reason the phrase had stuck in his mind.",
      "The tiny golden letters upon the Muggle device said,",
      "All right, you primitive screwheads! Listen up!"

      "\"All right you primitive screwheads! Listen up! You see this?\nThis... is my boomstick!\u202f\"",
      "In darkness absolute, a boy stood holding his wand to the solid\nmetal wall of Azkaban, essaying a magic that only three other\npeople in the world would have believed possible, and that none\nsave he alone could wield.",
      "Of course a powerful wizard could've cut through the wall in\nseconds, with a gesture and a word.",
      "For an average adult it might have been a matter of a few\nminutes' work, and afterward they would have been winded.",
      "But to accomplish the same end as a first-year Hogwarts student,\nyou had to be efficient.",
      "Luckily - well, not luckily, luck had nothing to do\nwith it - conscientiously, Harry had practiced\nTransfiguration for an extra hour every day, to the point where he\nwas ahead of even Hermione in that one class; he'd practiced\npartial Transfiguration to the point where his thoughts had begun\ntaking the true universe for granted, so that it required only\nslightly more effort to keep its timeless quantum nature in mind,\neven as he kept a firm mental separation between the concept of\nForm and the concept of substance.",
      "And the problem with that art having become so\nroutine...",
      "...was that Harry could think about other things while he was\ndoing it.",
      "Somehow his thoughts had managed to not go there, to not\nconfront the obvious, until he was faced with the prospect of\nreally actually doing it in just a few minutes.",
      "What Harry was about to do...",
      "...was dangerous.",
      "Really dangerous.",
      "Someone-might-actually-genuinely-get-killed dangerous.",
      "Facing down twelve Dementors without a Patronus Charm had been\nscary, but merely scary. Harry could have cast the\nPatronus Charm, would have cast it as soon as he thought\nhe was in danger of not being able to do so, as soon as he felt his\nresistance beginning to fail. And even if that hadn't worked...\neven so, unless the Dementors had been instructed to Kiss anyone\nthey found, failure shouldn't have been fatal.",
      "This was different.",
      "The Transfigured Muggle device could explode and kill them.",
      "The interface between the technology and the magic could fail in\nany number of ways and kill them.",
      "The Aurors could get in a lucky shot.",
      "It was just, well...",
      "Seriously dangerous.",
      "Harry had caught his mind trying to argue itself into believing\nthat it was safe.",
      "And sure, the whole thing could work, but...",
      "But even leaving out that rationalists weren't ever allowed to\nargue themselves into things, Harry knew he couldn't possibly have\nargued himself into estimating less than a 20% probability of\ndying.",
      "Lose, said Hufflepuff.",
      "Lose, said the voice of Professor Quirrell in his\nmind.",
      "Lose, said his mental model of Hermione and Professor\nMcGonagall and Professor Flitwick and Neville Longbottom and, well,\nbasically everyone Harry knew except for Fred and George, who would\nhave gone for it in a hot second.",
      "He should just go find Dumbledore and turn himself in. He\nshould, he really really should, it was the only sane\nthing to do at this point.",
      "And if it'd been only Harry on the mission, only his own life\nthat'd been at stake, he would have; he surely would have.",
      "The part that was almost causing him to lose his concentration\non the partial Transfiguration he was performing, the part that was\nthreatening to open him to the Dementors...",
      "...was Professor Quirrell, still unconscious, still a snake.",
      "If Professor Quirrell went to Azkaban for his part in the\nescape, he would die. He probably wouldn't last even a week. He was\nthat sensitive.",
      "It was that simple.",
      "If Harry lost here...",
      "He lost Professor Quirrell.",
      "Even though he's probably evil, said the Hufflepuff\npart of him quietly. Even so?",
      "It wasn't a decision that Harry had made in any conscious way.\nHe just couldn't do it. Losing was for House points, not\npeople.",
      "If you think your own life is valuable enough that you're\nnot willing to take on an eighty percent probability of dying in\norder to protect all the prisoners in Azkaban, his Slytherin\nside observed, there's no way you can justify taking a twenty\npercent risk to your life to save Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell.\nThe math doesn't add up, you can't be assigning consistent\nutilities over outcomes here.",
      "The logical side of him noted that Slytherin had just won the\nargument.",
      "Harry kept the Form in his mind, kept on casting the spell. He\ncould always just abort the mission when he was done with\nthe Transfiguration, he didn't want to lose the effort he'd already\ninvested.",
      "And then Harry thought of something else that suddenly made it\nvery hard to keep the magic going, very hard to keep up his\nresistance to the Dementors.",
      "What if the portkey doesn't take us where Professor Quirrell\nsaid it did?",
      "It was obvious in retrospect the moment he thought about it.",
      "Even if the planned escape went completely right, even if the\nMuggle device worked and didn't explode and\ndidn't interact badly with the mated magic item, even if\nthe Aurors didn't get in a lucky shot, even if Harry made it far\nenough away from Azkaban to use the portkey...",
      "...there might not be a psychiatric healer at the end of it.",
      "That was something Harry had believed when he'd trusted\nProfessor Quirrell, and he'd forgotten to re-evaluate it after\nProfessor Quirrell was no longer to be trusted.",
      "You can't do this, said Hufflepuff. At this point\nwe're talking mere stupidity.",
      "Cold seemed to spread through the room, but Harry kept the\nTransfiguration going, even as his resistance against the Dementors\nfaltered.",
      "I can't lose Professor Quirrell.",
      "He tried to kill a police officer, said Hufflepuff.\nYou already lost him, in that moment. Bellatrix is probably\njust what everyone thinks she is. Just take your Cloak back, go\nfind Dumbledore and tell him you were tricked.",
      "No, thought Harry desperately, not without talking\nto Professor Quirrell, there might be an explanation, I don't know,\nmaybe he was standing far enough away from my Patronus that the\nDementors got to him... I don't understand, it doesn't make sense\non any hypothesis, why he would do that... I can't\njust...",
      "Harry turned his mind away from that chain of thought before it\ncompletely broke his resistance to the fear, because he couldn't\nthink of feeding Professor Quirrell to Dementors while staying\nresolved against Death, it was a cognitive impossibility.",
      "Your reasoning is artificially impaired, observed the\nlogical part of him calmly, find a way to unimpair it.",
      "All right, let's just generate alternatives, Harry\nthought. Not choose, not weigh, certainly not commit... just\nthink about what else I might be able to do besides the original\nplan.",
      "And Harry went on cutting the hole in the wall. He was using\npartial Transfiguration on a thin cylindrical shell of metal, two\nmeters in diameter and half a millimeter thick, running all the way\nthrough the wall. He was Transfiguring that half-millimeter\nthickness of metal into motor oil. Motor oil was a liquid and you\nweren't to Transfigure liquids because they might evaporate, but he\nand Bellatrix and the snake all had Bubble-Head Charms. And Harry\nwould cast Finite on the oil immediately after, dispelling his own\nTransfiguration...",
      "...as soon as the separated and lubricated hunk of metal slid\nout of the wall and onto the floor of their cell, he'd slanted it\nso gravity would pull it in, once the Transfiguration was done.",
      "If Harry and Bellatrix didn't exit on his broomstick\nthrough the resulting hole in the wall...",
      "Harry's brain suggested that he could try to Transfigure a\nsurface cover over the hole in the wall, leaving a space for\nBellatrix and Professor Quirrell to hide in, wearing the Cloak,\nwhile Harry turned himself in. And Professor Quirrell would\neventually wake up, and he and Bellatrix could try to figure out\nhow to exit Azkaban on their own.",
      "It was, first of all, a dumb idea, and second, there would still\nbe a huge hunk of metal on the floor of the cell, which would give\nit away.",
      "And then Harry's brain saw the obvious.",
      "Let Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell use the escape route\nyou invented. You stay behind, and turn yourself in.",
      "Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell were the ones whose lives were\nat stake.",
      "They were gaining, not losing, from taking the risk.",
      "And there was no reason, no sane reason at all, for Harry to go\nwith them.",
      "A calm came over Harry as he thought it, the cold and darkness\nthat had been wavering around the fringes of his mind retreated.\nYes, that was it, that was the creative outside-the-box route, that\nwas the hidden third alternative. The falseness of the dilemma was\nobvious in retrospect. If Harry turned himself in, he\ndidn't have to turn in Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell.\nIf Bellatrix and Professor Quirrell took a dangerous escape route,\nHarry didn't need to go with them.",
      "Harry didn't even need to face the embarrassment of admitting\nhe'd been tricked, if he ordered Bellatrix to remove the memory.\nEveryone would just assume he'd been kidnapped, including Harry\nhimself. Admittedly, there was no plausible reason why the Dark\nLord would ever ask Bellatrix to do that; but Harry could simply\nsmile and tell Bellatrix she wasn't allowed to know, and that would\nbe that...",
      "Her Auror team had gotten around three-quarters of the way down\nAzkaban, as had the other two teams on the other two spirals.\nAmelia was feeling tenser already, though she was betting on the\ncriminals hiding on the second-to-lowest floor, part of her wished\nDumbledore had thought to check that specific floor more carefully\nand part of her was glad he hadn't.",
      "And then there was a distant sound, like a tiny 'tink' noise\ncoming from far away. Like a very loud sound coming from the\nsecond-to-lowest floor, say.",
      "Amelia looked at Dumbledore before she realized, before she\nmanaged to stop herself.",
      "The old wizard shrugged, gave her a small smile, said, \"Since\nyou asked it, Amelia,\" and went off yet again.",
      "\"Finite Incantatem,\" Harry said to the oil coating the\ngiant chunk of metal on the floor. He hardly heard himself speak,\nhis ears were still ringing from the gigantic thud of the solid\nmetal sliding out of the wall and falling. (He should have put up a\nQuieting Charm, in retrospect, though that wouldn't have stopped\nthe noise from spreading through the solid metal floor.) And then\nHarry said it again, \"Finite Incantatem\" to the oil\ncoating the two-meter hole in the wall, spreading the effect wide;\nit was his own magic Harry was canceling, which made the spell\nalmost effortless. Harry was feeling a bit tired now, but that was\nthe last use of magic he would need. He hadn't even needed\nto do it, really, but Harry didn't want to leave Transfigured\nliquid lying around, and he didn't want to betray the secret of\npartial Transfiguration either.",
      "It seemed very... inviting, that two-meter hole leading\nto freedom.",
      "The light from outside coming in... wasn't exactly the Sun\nshining on his face, but it was brighter than anything of Azkaban's\ninterior.",
      "Harry was tempted to just go with, just hop on the\nbroomstick with Bellatrix and the snake. Chances were that they\nwould get out safely. And if they did get out\nsafely, and Harry came with, then he and Professor Quirrell could\ngo back in time and look perfectly innocent, everything could go\nback to normal.",
      "If Harry stayed behind and turned himself in... then even if\neveryone assumed Harry had been a hostage, assumed Harry had lied\nto Professor McGonagall's Patronus at wandpoint... even if Harry\nhimself got off lightly, well...",
      "It wasn't likely that the Defense Professor would go on teaching\nat Hogwarts.",
      "Professor Quirrell would have reached the predestined end of his\ncareer, in February of the school year.",
      "And yes, Professor McGonagall would kill Harry, and yes, it\nwould be slow and painful.",
      "But staying behind was the sensible, safe, sane thing\nto do, and Harry was feeling more relaxed than regretful.",
      "Harry turned to Bellatrix; he opened his mouth to instruct her a\nfinal time -",
      "And there was a hiss, a weak hiss, a hiss that sounded slow and\nconfused, and the hiss said,",
      "\"What wass... that noisse?\u202f\"",
      "Through the corridor the old wizard strode. He came to a metal\ndoor and opened it, already knowing from memory that the cells\nwithin were empty.",
      "Seven mighty and discerning incantations the wizard spoke then,\nbefore he moved on; it would be little enough exertion in total,\nwith so few cells left to check.",
      "\"Teacher,\" Harry hissed. So many emotions bubbling up\nin him, all at once. He knew, though he could not see, that the\ngreen snake around Bellatrix's shoulders, was slowly lifting its\nhead to look around. \"Are you... all right, teacher?\u202f\"",
      "\"Teacher?\u202f\" came the weak, confused hiss. \"Where\niss thiss?",
      "\"Prisson,\" Harry hissed, \"the prisson with\nlife-eaterss, we were to resscue a woman, you and I. You tried to\nsslay the protector man, I blocked your killing cursse, there was a\nressonance between uss... you fell unconssciouss, I had to defeat\nthe protector man mysself... my guardian Charm wass disspelled, the\nlife-eaterss could tell the protectorss that the woman had\nesscaped. There iss ssomeone here who can ssensse my guardian\nCharm, probably the sschoolmasster... so had to disspell my\nguardian Charm, find different way to hide you and the woman from\nlife-eaterss without guardian Charm, learn to protect mysself\nwithout guardian Charm, sscare off life-eaterss without guardian\nCharm, then devisse new esscape plan for you and the woman, and\nfinally, cut hole in thick metal wall of prisson even though I am\nonly firsst-year sstudent. No time to explain, you musst go now. If\nwe never meet again, teacher, then I was glad to know you for a\ntime, even though you are probably evil. It iss good to have the\nchance to ssay thiss much: Goodbye.\"",
      "And Harry took the broomstick and presented it to Bellatrix,\nsaying simply, \"Get on.\"",
      "He had decided to keep the memories. For one thing, they were\nimportant. For another, he and the Defense Professor had started\nplanning this a week ago, and Harry wasn't about to obliterate the\nwhole last week, or explain to Bellatrix exactly what\nneeded to be Obliviated. Harry could probably fool Veritaserum, and\nif Dumbledore insisted that Harry drop his Occlumency shields for a\ndeeper examination... well, Harry had acted heroically\nthroughout.",
      "\"Sstop!\u202f\" said the snake. Its voice was stronger now.\n\"Sstop, sstop, sstop! What do you mean, goodbye?\u202f\"",
      "\"Esscape plan iss rissky,\" said Harry. \"My life iss\nnot at sstake, only yourss and herss. Sso I am sstaying, turning\nmysself in -\"",
      "\"No!\u202f\" said the snake. The hiss was forceful.\n\"Musst not! Not permitted!\u202f\"",
      "Bellatrix mounted the broomstick; Harry could sense (but never\nsee) her head turning to look at him, she said no word. Awaiting\nhim, perhaps, or merely awaiting his orders.",
      "\"No longer trusst you,\" Harry said simply. \"Not\nssince you tried to sslay the protector man.\"",
      "And the snake hissed, \"I did not sseek to sslay the\nprotector man! Are you fool, boy? Sslaying him would not make\nssensse, evil or no!\u202f\"",
      "The Earth ceased to turn on its axis, paused in its orbit around\nthe Sun.",
      "The snake's hiss was now more furious than anything Harry had\never heard from the human Professor Quirrell. \"Sslay him? Had I\nssought to sslay him he would have been dead within ssecondss, fool\nboy, he wass no match for me! I ssought to ssubdue, to dominate,\nforce him to drop sshieldss upon hiss mind, needed to read him, to\nknow who awaited hiss reply, learn detailss for memory sspell\n-\"",
      "\"You casst killing cursse!\u202f\"",
      "\"Knew he would dodge!\u202f\"",
      "\"Wass hiss life worth sso little? What if he did not\ndodge?\u202f\"",
      "\"Would have pusshed him out of the way with own magic, fool\nboy!\u202f\"",
      "Again the pause in the planet's spin. Harry hadn't thought of\nthat.",
      "\"Witlesss dunce of a plotter,\" hissed the snake, so\nangrily that the hisses seemed to overlap and slither over each\nother's tails, \"clever imbecile, cunning idiot, fool of an\nuntrained Sslytherin, your missplaced misstrust hass ruined\n-\"",
      "\"Thiss iss not a fair time to argue,\" Harry observed\nmildly. The surge of relief trying to flood through him was\ncanceled by the increased tension. \"Ssince I cannot get angry\nat you properly, without opening mysself to life-eaterss. Musst\nrussh, ssomeone may have heard noisse -\"",
      "\"Explain esscape plan,\" the snake said imperiously.\n\"Sswiftly!\u202f\"",
      "Harry explained. Parseltongue didn't have words for the Muggle\ntechnology, but Harry described the function and Professor Quirrell\nseemed to understand.",
      "There were a few short hisses, the snakish equivalent of a bark\nof surprised laughter, and then, snapped commands. \"Tell woman\nto look away, casst sspell of ssilence, sset guardian Charm outside\ndoor. Will transsform mysself, make few sswift improvementss to\nyour invention, give woman emergency potion sso sshe can sshield\nuss, transsform back before you disspell Charm.

      "\"And am I to believe,\" Harry hissed, \"that healer\nfor woman truly awaitss uss?\u202f\"",

      "Harry stared at the invisible snake.",
      "On the one hand, saying it like that made Harry feel rather\ndumb.",
      "And on the other hand, it wasn't exactly reassuring.",
      "\"Sso,\" Harry hissed, \"what iss your plan for me,\nprecissely?\u202f\"",

      "The old wizard reached out toward another metal door, from\nbehind which came a endless dead mutter, \"I'm not serious, I'm not\nserious, I'm not serious...\" The red-golden phoenix on his shoulder\nwas already screaming urgently, and the old wizard was already\nwincing, when -",
      "Another cry pierced the corridor, phoenix-like but not the true\nphoenix's call.",
      "The wizard's head turned, looked at the blazing silver creature\non his other shoulder, even as ephemeral and substanceless talons\nlaunched the spell-entity into the air.",
      "The false phoenix flew down the corridor.",
      "The old wizard raced off after, legs churning like a spry young\nman of sixty.",
      "The true phoenix screamed once, twice, and a third time,\nhovering before the metal door; and then, when it became clear that\nits master would not return for all its calling, flew reluctantly\nafter.",
      "Professor Quirrell had assumed his true form, this time -\nPolyjuice only lasted for an hour without redosing - and though the\nDefense Professor was pale, leaning against the metal bars of the\nnearest cell, his magic was strong enough to seize his wand without\na word, even as Bellatrix doffed the Cloak and placed it obediently\nin Harry's waiting hand. The sense of doom was building once more,\nthough not in full force, as the Defense Professor's power\nreturned, the fringes of its vast force clashing with Harry's\nslight childish aura.",
      "Harry said aloud the description of his Muggle device, naming it\nto the observing wizard, and then a Finite from Harry turned all\nhis hard work back into an ice cube. Professor Quirrell could not\ncast spells on something Harry had Transfigured, for that would be\nan interaction, however slight, between their magics, but -",
      "Three seconds after, Professor Quirrell was holding his own\nTransfigured version of the Muggle device. A single barked word and\na sweep of his wand, and the residue of glue was gone from the\nmagical item; three more incantations later, the magical and\ntechnological were fused together as though into a single thing,\nand Charms of Unbreakability and flawless function had been cast\nupon the Muggle device.",
      "(Harry felt a lot better about doing this under adult\nsupervision.)",
      "A potion was thrown to Bellatrix, and Professor Quirrell and\nHarry both commanded, \"Drink,\" as though speaking in the same\nvoice. The emaciated woman had already been lifting it to her lips,\nwithout waiting; for it was evident to anyone that this snake\nAnimagus was a servant of the Dark Lord, and a powerful and trusted\none.",
      "Harry finished pulling the hood of the Cloak of Invisibility\nover his head.",
      "A brief and terrible magic lashed out from the Defense\nProfessor's wand, scouring the hole in the wall, scarring the huge\nchunk of metal that lay in the room's midst; as Harry had\nrequested, saying that the method he'd used might identify him.",
      "\"Left-hand glove,\" Harry said to his pouch, and drew it forth,\nand put it on.",
      "A gesture from the Defense Professor made a harness appear upon\nBellatrix's shoulders, and another, smaller cloth device upon her\nhand, and something like handcuffs on her wrists, even as the woman\nfinished drinking the potion.",
      "A strange, unhealthy color seemed to come over Bellatrix's pale\nface, she straightened, her sunken eyes seemed brighter and far\nmore dangerous...",
      "...small wisps of steam were coming out of her ears...",
      "(Harry decided not to think about that part.)",
      "...and Bellatrix Black laughed, then, sudden mad laughter that\nrang much too loudly amid the small prison cells of Azkaban.",
      "(Very soon, the Defense Professor had said, Bellatrix would fall\nunconscious and stay that way for quite awhile, the price of the\npotion she had taken; but for just a few moments she would regain\nperhaps a twentieth part of the power she had once wielded.)",
      "The Defense Professor threw his wand toward Bellatrix, and an\ninstant later blurred into a green snake.",
      "An instant after that the Dementors' fear returned to\nthe room.",
      "Bellatrix flinched only slightly, caught the wand, and gestured\nwithout a word; the snake flew up and was inserted into the harness\non her back.",
      "Harry said \"Up!\" to the broomstick.",
      "Bellatrix attached the wand to the holster on her hand.",
      "Harry leaped onto the two-person broomstick in the lead\nposition.",
      "Bellatrix followed behind him, she took the cufflike devices on\nher wrists and chained her hands to the grips of the broomstick,\neven as Harry's right hand shoved his wand into his pouch.",
      "And the three shot forward through the hole in the wall -",
      "- emerging into the open air, directly above the Dementors' pit,\nin the interior of the vast triangular prism that was Azkaban, the\nblue sky now clearly visible above them, shining down its\ndaylight.",
      "Harry angled the broomstick and began accelerating, upward and\ntoward the center of the triangular space. His left hand, gloved to\nprevent direct contact between his skin and something which\nProfessor Quirrell had Transfigured, held the switch of the control\non the Muggle device.",
      "Far above them, distant shouts rang out.",
      "All right, you primitive screwheads!",
      "Aurors on fast racing broomsticks angled out of the sky, diving\nstraight down toward them, faint sparks of light already blazing\ndownward as the first shots were fired.",
      "Listen up!",
      "\"Protego Maximus!\" shouted Bellatrix in a mighty, cracked voice,\nfollowed by a cackling laugh as a shimmering blue field surrounded\nthem.",
      "You see this?",
      "From the decaying pit in the center of Azkaban, over a hundred\nDementors rose into the air, appearing to some as a great mass of\ncorpses, a flying graveyard; appearing to another as a conglomerate\nof absences that seemed to form one vast rip in the world as they\nslid upward.",
      "This...",
      "The voice of an ancient and powerful wizard bellowed a terrible\nincantation, and a great blast of white-golden fire shot out of the\nhole in Azkaban's wall, shapeless for only a moment before it began\nto form wings.",
      "Is...",
      "And the Aurors activated the Anti-Anti-Gravity Jinx that had\nbeen built into the wards of Azkaban, disabling all flying spells\nwhose enchantment had not been cast with the recently changed\npassphrase.",
      "The lift on Harry's broom switched off.",
      "Gravity, on the other hand, stayed on.",
      "Their broom's upward rise slowed, started to decelerate, began\nthe process of turning into a fall.",
      "My...",
      "But the enchantments that kept the broom pointed in a direction\nand allowed steering, the enchantments that kept the riders\nattached and somewhat protected them from acceleration,\nthose enchantments were still functioning.",
      "BROOMSTICK!",
      "Harry hit the ignition switch on the General Technics made,\nmodel Berserker PFRC, N-class, ammonium perchlorate\ncomposite propellant, solid-fuel rocket that had been mated to his\nNimbus X200 two-person broomstick.",
      "And there was noise."

      "Broomsticks had been invented during what a Muggle would have\ncalled the Dark Ages, supposedly by a legendary witch named\nCelestria Relevo, allegedly the great-great-granddaughter of\nMerlin.",
      "Celestria Relevo, or whichever person or group had really\ninvented those enchantments, hadn't known a darned thing about\nNewtonian mechanics.",
      "Broomsticks, therefore, worked by Aristotelian physics.",
      "They went where you pointed them.",
      "If you wanted to move straight forward, you pointed them\nstraight forward; you didn't worry about keeping some of the thrust\ngoing downward to cancel out the effect of gravity.",
      "If you turned a broomstick, all of its new velocity was in the\nnew direction of pointing, it didn't go sideways based on its old\nmomentum.",
      "Broomsticks had maximum speeds, not maximum accelerations. Not\nbecause of anything to do with air resistance, but because a\nbroomstick had some maximum Aristotelian impetus its enchantments\ncould exert.",
      "Harry had never explicitly noticed that before, despite\nbeing dextrous enough to get the best grades in flying class.\nBroomsticks worked so much like the human mind instinctively\nexpected them to work that his brain had managed to\nentirely overlook their physical absurdity. Harry, on his\nfirst Thursday of broomstick lessons, had been distracted by more\ninteresting-seeming phenomena, words written on paper and a glowing\nred ball. So his brain had simply suspended its disbelief, marked\nthe reality of broomsticks as accepted, and proceeded to have its\nfun, without ever once thinking of the question whose\nanswer would have been obvious. For it is a sad fact that we only\never think about a tiny fraction of all the phenomena we\nencounter...",
      "That is the story of how Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres was\nalmost killed by his own lack of curiosity.",
      "Because rockets did not work by Aristotelian\nphysics.",
      "Rockets did not work like a human mind instinctively\nthought a flying thing should work.",
      "A rocket-assisted broomstick, therefore, did not move\nlike the magical broomsticks upon which Harry was such a very good\nflyer.",
      "None of this actually went through Harry's mind at the time.",
      "For one thing, the loudest noise he'd ever heard in his life was\npreventing him from hearing himself think.",
      "For another thing, accelerating upward at four gravities meant\nthat he had around two and a half seconds, total, to go from the\nbottom to the top of Azkaban.",
      "And even if they were two and a half of the longest\nseconds in the history of Time, that wasn't enough room to do much\nthinking.",
      "There was time only to see the lights of the Aurors' curses\narrowing down at him, slightly angle the broomstick to avoid them,\nrealize that the broomstick was simply continuing on with mostly\nthe same momentum instead of going in the direction he pointed it,\nand activate the wordless concepts",
      "*crap*",
      "and",
      "*Newton*",
      "whereupon Harry angled the broomstick much harder and then they\nstarted to very quickly approach the wall so he angled it back the\nother way and there were more lights coming down and the Dementors\nwere sliding smoothly up toward them along with some kind of giant\nwinged creature of white-golden flame so Harry wrenched the\nbroomstick back toward the sky but now he was still sliding toward\nanother wall so he tilted the broom slightly and he stopped\napproaching but he was too close so he tilted it again and then the\ndistant Aurors on their broomsticks weren't very distant at all and\nhe was going to crash into that woman so he spun his broomstick\nstraight away from her and then in another instant he realized his\nrocket was an extremely powerful flamethrower and in a fraction of\na second it would be pointing directly at the Auror so he spun the\nbroomstick sideways as he kept going up and he couldn't remember if\nit was pointing at any Aurors now but at least it wasn't pointing\nat her",
      "Harry missed another Auror by about a meter, zipping past him on\na sideways-pointed flamethrower moving upward at, Harry would later\nguess, around 300 kilometers per hour.",
      "If there were any screams of roasted Aurors he didn't hear them,\nbut this was not evidence one way or another, because all that\nHarry was hearing at the moment was an extremely loud noise.",
      "A couple of calmer if not quieter seconds later, there\ndidn't seem to be any Aurors around, or any Dementors, or any giant\nwinged flame creatures, and the vast and terrible edifice of\nAzkaban looked surprisingly tiny from this height.",
      "Harry got the broomstick pointed toward the Sun, faintly visible\nthrough the clouds, it wasn't high in the sky at this time of day\nand month of winter, and the broomstick accelerated for another two\nseconds in that direction and picked up an amazing amount of speed\nvery quickly before the solid-fuel rocket burned itself out.",
      "After that, once Harry could hear himself think again, when\nthere was only the howling wind from their ridiculous speed, and\nHarry's enchantment-assisted fingers gripping the broomstick were\nmerely resisting the decelerating drag of moving way faster than\nterminal velocity, that was when Harry actually thought\nall that stuff about Newtonian mechanics and Aristotelian physics\nand broomsticks and rocketry and the importance of curiosity and\nhow he was never going to do anything this Gryffindor ever again or\nat least not until after he learned the Dark Lord's secret of\nimmortality and why had he listened to Professor Quirinus\n\"I asssure you, boy, I would not attempt thisss if I did not\nanticipate my own ssurvival\u202f\" Quirrell instead of Professor\nMichael \"Son, if you try anything to do with rockets on your own, I\nmean anything whatsoever without a trained professonal\nwatching, you will die and that will make Mum sad\"\nVerres-Evans.",
      "\"WHAT?\u202f\" shrieked Amelia at the mirror.",
      "The wind had died down to a bearable level as the air resistance\nslowed them, giving Harry plenty of opportunity to listen to the\nbuzzing, ringing sound that seemed to fill his whole brain.",
      "Professor Quirrell had been supposed to cast a Quieting Charm on\nthe rocket exhaust... apparently there were limits to what Quieting\nCharms could do... in retrospect, Harry should have Transfigured a\npair of earplugs, not just trusted to the Quieting Charm, though\nthat probably wouldn't have been enough either...",
      "Well, magical healing probably had something to treat permanent\nhearing damage.",
      "No, really, magical healing probably had something to treat\nthat. He'd seen students go to Madam Pomfrey with injuries that\nsounded a lot worse...",
      "Is there some way of transplanting an imaginary personality\nto someone else's head? asked Hufflepuff. I don't want to\nlive in yours anymore.",
      "Harry shoved it all into the back of his mind, there really\nwasn't anything he could do about it right now. Was there anything\nhe should be worrying about -",
      "Then Harry glanced behind him, remembering for the first time to\ncheck whether Bellatrix or Professor Quirrell had been blown off\nthe broomstick.",
      "But the green snake was still in its harness, and the emaciated\nwoman was still clinging to the broomstick, her face still charged\nwith unhealthy color and her eyes still bright and dangerous. Her\nshoulders were shaking like she was laughing hysterically, and her\nlips were moving as though to shout, but no sound was coming out\n-",
      "Oh, right.",
      "Harry took off the hood of his cloak, tapped his ears to let her\nknow he couldn't hear.",
      "Whereupon Bellatrix grasped her wand, pointed it at Harry, and\nsuddenly the ringing in his ears diminished, he could hear her.",
      "A moment later he regretted it; the imprecations she was\nscreaming at Azkaban, Dementors, Aurors, Dumbledore, Lucius,\nBartemy Couch, something called the Order of the Phoenix, and all\nwho stood in the way of her Dark Lord, et cetera, were not suitable\nfor younger and more sensitive listeners; and her laughter was\nhurting his newly healed ears.",
      "\"Enough, Bella,\" Harry finally said, and her voice stopped on\nthe instant.",
      "There was a pause. Harry pulled the Cloak back over his head,\njust on general principles; and realized in the same instant that\nthey might have telescopes down there or something, in retrospect\npulling down his hood for even a moment had been an incredibly dumb\nmove, he hoped the whole mission didn't end up failing because of\nthat one error...",
      "We're not really cut out for this, are we? observed\nSlytherin.",
      "Hey, Hufflepuff objected in sheer reflex, we can't\nexpect to do anything perfectly the first time, we probably just\nneed more practice FORGET I SAID THAT.",
      "Harry looked back again, saw Bellatrix looking around with a\npuzzled, wondering look on her face. Her head kept turning,\nturning.",
      "And finally Bellatrix said, her voice now lower, \"My Lord, where\nare we?\"",
      "What do you mean? was what Harry wanted to say, but the\nDark Lord would never admit to not understanding anything, so Harry\nreplied, dryly, \"We are on a broomstick.\"",
      "Does she think she's dead, that this is Heaven?",
      "Bellatrix's hands were still chained to the broomstick, so it\nwas only a finger that came up and pointed when she said, \"What is\nthat?\u202f\"",
      "Harry followed the direction of her finger and saw... nothing in\nparticular, actually...",
      "Then Harry realized. After they'd gone up high enough, there\nhadn't been any clouds to obscure it any more.",
      "\"That is the Sun, dear Bella.\"",
      "It came out remarkably controlled, the Dark Lord sounding\nperfectly calm and maybe a little impatient with her, even as the\ntears started down Harry's cheeks.",
      "In the endless cold, in the pitch blackness, the Sun would\nsurely have been...",
      "A happy memory...",
      "Bellatrix's head kept turning.",
      "\"And the fluffy things?\" she said.",
      "\"Clouds.\"",
      "There was a pause, and then Bellatrix said, \"But what\nare they?\"",
      "Harry didn't answer her, there was no way his voice could have\nbeen steady, would have been steady, it was all he could do to keep\nhis breathing perfectly regular while he cried.",
      "After a while, Bellatrix breathed, so softly Harry almost didn't\nhear, \"Pretty...\"",
      "Her face slowly relaxed, the color leaving its paleness almost\nas quickly as it had arrived.",
      "Her skeletal body slumped down against the broomstick.",
      "The borrowed wand dangled lifelessly from the strap attached to\nher unmoving hand.",
      "YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING -",
      "Harry's mind remembered then, the Pepper-Up potion came at a\ncost; Bellatrix would ssleep for a conssiderable time,\nProfessor Quirrell had said.",
      "And in the same instant another part of Harry became utterly\nconvinced, looking back at the chalk-white emaciated woman, seeming\ndeader in the bright sunlight than anything Harry had ever seen\nalive, that she was dead, that she had just uttered her\nlast word, that Professor Quirrell had misjudged the dosage -",
      "- or deliberately sacrificed Bellatrix to guard their own escape\n-",
      "Is she breathing?",
      "Harry couldn't see if she was breathing.",
      "There was no way, on the broomstick, to reach back and take her\npulse.",
      "Harry looked ahead to make sure they weren't about to run into\nany flying rocks, kept on steering the broomstick toward the Sun,\nthe invisible boy and the possibly dead woman riding off into the\nafternoon, while his fingers gripped the wood so hard they turned\nwhite.",
      "He couldn't reach back and perform artificial respiration.",
      "He couldn't use anything from his healer's kit.",
      "Trust Professor Quirrell to have not endangered\nher?",
      "Strange, it was strange, that even genuinely believing that\nProfessor Quirrell hadn't meant to kill the Auror (for it\nwould have been stupid), thinking of the Defense\nProfessor's reassurances no longer felt reassuring.",
      "Then it occurred to Harry that he had yet to check -",
      "Harry looked back, and hissed, \"Teacher?\u202f\"",
      "The snake did not stir within its harness, and said no word.",
      "...maybe the snake, not being an actual rider, hadn't been\nprotected from the acceleration. Or maybe coming that close to the\nDementors without a shield, even for a moment in Animagus form, had\nknocked out the Defense Professor.",
      "That wasn't good.",
      "It was to have been Professor Quirrell who told Harry when it\nwas safe to use the portkey.",
      "Harry steered the broomstick with whitened fingers, and thought,\nhe thought very hard for a small unmeasured length of time, during\nwhich Bellatrix might or might not have been breathing, during\nwhich Professor Quirrell himself might have already been\nnot-breathing for a while.",
      "And Harry decided that while it was possible to recover from the\nerror of wasting the portkey in his possession, it was not possible\nto recover from the error of letting a brain go too long without\noxygen.",
      "So Harry took the next portkey in the sequence from his pouch,\nas he slowed his broomstick to a halt in the bright blue air (Harry\ndidn't know, when he thought about it, whether a portkey's ability\nto adjust for the Earth's rotation also included the ability to\nmatch velocity in general with its new surroundings), touched the\nportkey to the broomstick, and...",
      "Harry paused, still holding the twig, the mate of the twig he\nhad snapped what seemed like two weeks ago. He was feeling a sudden\nreluctance; his brain seemed to have learned the rule, by some\npurely neural process of operant conditioning, that Snapping Twigs\nIs A Bad Idea.",
      "But that wasn't actually logical, so Harry snapped the twig\nanyway.",
      "There was a thunderous boom from behind the nearby metal door,\ncausing Amelia to drop the mirror she was holding and spin around\nwith her wand in hand, and then that door burst open to reveal\nAlbus Dumbledore, standing there in front of a great smoking hole\nin the prison wall.",
      "\"Amelia,\" said the old wizard. There was no trace of any of his\ncustomary levity, his eyes were hard as sapphires beneath his\nhalf-moon glasses. \"I must leave Azkaban and I must do so\nnow. Is there any faster way than a broomstick to get\nbeyond the wards?\"",
      "\"No -\"",
      "\"Then I require your fastest broomstick, at once!\"",
      "The place where Amelia wanted to be was with the Auror\nwho had been injured by that Fiendfyre or whatever it had been.",
      "What she needed to do was find out what Dumbledore\nknew.",
      "\"You!\" the old witch barked at the team around her. \"Keep\nclearing the corridors until you're at bottom, they may not all\nhave escaped yet!\" And then, to the old wizard, \"Two broomsticks.\nYou can brief me once we're in the air.\"",
      "There was a match of stares, but not a long one.",
      "A sickeningly hard yank caught at Harry's abdomen, considerably\nharder than the yank that had transported him to Azkaban, and this\ntime the distance traversed was great enough that he could hear an\ninstant of silence, watch the unseeable space between spaces, in\nthe crack between one place and another.",
      "The Sun, which had shone on the two only briefly, was swiftly\noccluded by a raincloud as they shot away from Azkaban, in the\ndirection of the wind and faster than the wind.",
      "\"Who's behind it?\" shouted Amelia to the broomstick flying a\npace away from her.",
      "\"One of two people,\" Dumbledore said back, \"I know not, at this\ninstant, who. If the first, then we are in trouble. If the second,\nwe are all in far greater trouble.\"",
      "Amelia didn't spare any breath for sighs. \"When will you\nknow?\"",
      "The old wizard's voice was grim, quiet and yet somehow rising\nabove the wind. \"Three things they need for perfection, if it is\nthat one: The flesh of the Dark Lord's most faithful servant, the\nblood of the Dark Lord's greatest foe, and access to a certain\ngrave. I had thought Harry Potter safe, with their attempt on\nAzkaban all but failed - though I still set guards upon him - but\nnow I am fearful indeed. They have access to Time, someone with a\nTime-Turner is sending messages for them; and I suspect the kidnap\nattempt on Harry Potter has already taken place some hours ago.\nWhich is why we have not heard about it, being in Azkaban\nwhere Time cannot knot itself. That past came after our own future,\nyou see.\"",
      "\"And if it is the other?\" shouted Amelia. What she had heard\nalready was worrying enough; that sounded like the darkest of Dark\nrituals, and centering on the dead Dark Lord himself.",
      "The old wizard, his face now even grimmer, said nothing, only\nshook his head.",
      "When the portkey's yank had subsided, the Sun was only just\npeeking over the horizon, looking more like dawn than sunset, as\ntheir broom hovered low above a brief expanse of dark-orange rock\nand sand, arranged into lumpy hills like someone had kneaded the\nland's dough a few times and then forgotten to roll it flat. In the\nnear distance, waves rolled past in an endless vista of water,\nthough the ground over which the broomstick hovered was above sea\nlevel by meters at the least.",
      "Harry blinked at the dawn colors, and then realized the portkey\nhad been international.",
      "\"Oy!\" came a brisk, female shout from behind him, and Harry spun\nthe broomstick to look. A middle-aged lady was holding up one hand\nto her mouth in a deliberate calling gesture, and bustling forward.\nHer kindly features, narrow eyes, and umber skin marked a race\nunfamiliar to Harry; she was clad in brilliant purple robes of a\nstyle Harry had never seen before; and when her lips opened again\nshe spoke with an accent that Harry couldn't place, for he was not\nwidely traveled. \"Where were you? You're two hours late! I almost\ngave up on the lot of you... hello?\"",
      "There was a brief pause. Harry's thoughts seemed to be moving\noddly, too slow, everything felt distant, like there was a thick\npane of glass between himself and the world, and another thick pane\nof glass between himself and his feelings, so that he could see,\nbut not touch. It had come over him upon seeing the dawn's light\nand the kindly witch, and thinking that it all seemed like a proper\nend to the adventure.",
      "Then the witch was rushing forward and drawing her wand; a\nmuttered word severed the cuffs that bound the emaciated woman to\nthe broomstick, and Bellatrix was being floated down onto the sandy\nrock with her skeletal arms and pale legs dangling like lifeless\nthings. \"Oh, Merlin,\" whispered the witch, \"Merlin, Merlin,\nMerlin...\"",
      "She appears concerned, thought an abstract, distant\nthing between two panes of glass. Is that what a real healer\nwould say, or is it what someone told to put on a performance would\nsay?",
      "As though it wasn't Harry who spoke, but some other part of\nhimself behind yet another pane of glass, a whisper came from his\nlips. \"The green snake on her back is an Animagus.\" Not high the\nwhisper, not cold, only quiet. \"He is unconscious.\"",
      "The witch's head twitched up, to look at where that voice had\nseemed to speak out of empty air, and then looked back down at\nBellatrix. \"You're not Mister Jaffe.\"",
      "\"That would be the Animagus,\" whispered Harry's lips.\nOh, thought the Harry behind glass, listening to the sound\nof his own lips, that makes sense; Professor Quirrell must have\nused a different name.",
      "\"Since when is he a - bah, forget it.\" The witch laid\nher wand on the snake's nose for a moment, then shook her head\nsharply. \"Nothing wrong with him that a day's rest won't cure.\nHer...\"",
      "\"Can you wake him up now?\" whispered Harry's lips. Is that a\ngood idea? thought Harry, but his lips definitely seemed to\nthink so.",
      "Again the sharp headshake. \"If an Innervate didn't work on him\n-\" began the witch.",
      "\"I did not attempt one,\" whispered Harry's lips.",
      "\"What? Why - oh, never mind. Innervate.\"",
      "There was a pause, and then a snake slowly crawled out of its\nharness. Slowly the green head came up, looked around.",
      "A blur later, Professor Quirrell was standing, and a moment\nlater had sagged to his knees.",
      "\"Lie down,\" said the witch without looking up from Bellatrix.\n\"That you in there, Jeremy?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" said the Defense Professor rather hoarsely, as he\ncarefully laid himself down on a relatively flat patch of sandy\norange rock. He was not so pale as Bellatrix, but his face was\nbloodless in the dim dawn light. \"Salutations, Miss\nCamblebunker.\"",
      "\"I told you,\" said the witch, sharpness in her voice and a\nslight smile on her face, \"call me Crystal, this isn't Britain and\nwe'll have none of your formality here. And it's Doctor\nnow, not Miss.\"",
      "\"My apologies, Doctor Camblebunker.\" This was followed by a dry\nchuckle.",
      "The witch's smile grew a little wider, her voice that much\nsharper. \"Who's your friend?\"",
      "\"You don't need to know.\" The Defense Professor's eyes were\nclosed, where he lay on the ground.",
      "\"How wrong did it go?\"",
      "Very dryly indeed: \"You can read about it tomorrow in any\nnewspaper with an international section.\"",
      "The witch's wand was tapping here, there, poking and prodding\nall over Bellatrix's body. \"I missed you, Jeremy.\"",
      "\"Truly?\" said the Defense Professor, sounding slightly\nsurprised.",
      "\"Not even a tiny little bit. If I didn't owe you -\"",
      "The Defense Professor started to laugh, and then it turned into\nmore of a coughing fit.",
      "What do you think? said Slytherin to the Inner Critic,\nwhile Harry listened from behind the glass walls. Performance,\nor reality?",
      "Can't tell, said Harry's Inner Critic. I'm not in\ntop critical form right now.",
      "Can anyone think of a good probe to gather more\ninformation? said Ravenclaw.",
      "Again that whisper from the empty air above the broomstick:\n\"What is the chance of undoing all that was done to her?\"",
      "\"Oh, let's see. Legilimency and unknown Dark rituals, ten years\nfor that to set in place, followed by ten years of Dementor\nexposure? Undo that? You're out of your skull, Mister\nWhoever-You-Are. The question is whether there's anything\nleft, and I'd call that maybe one chance in three -\" The\nwitch suddenly cut herself off. Her voice, when it spoke again, was\nquieter. \"If you were her friend, before... then no, you're never\ngetting her back. Best understand that now.\"",
      "I'm voting that this is a performance, said the Inner\nCritic. She wouldn't just blurt all that out in response to one\nquestion unless she was looking for an opportunity.",
      "Noted, but I'm putting a low weight of confidence on\nthat, said Ravenclaw. It's very hard not to let your\nsuspicions control your perceptions when you're trying to weigh\nevidence that subtle.",
      "\"What potion did you give her?\" the witch said after opening\nBellatrix's mouth and peering inside, her wand flashing multiple\ncolors of illumination.",
      "The man lying on the ground calmly said, \"Pepper-Up -\"",
      "\"Were you out of your mind?\u202f\"",
      "Again the coughing laugh.",
      "\"She'll sleep for a week if she's lucky,\" the witch said, and\nclucked her tongue. \"I'll owl you when she opens her eyes, I\nsuppose, so you can come back and talk her into that Unbreakable\nVow. Have you got anything to stop her from killing me on the spot,\nif she manages to even move for another month?\"",
      "The Defense Professor, eyes still closed, took a sheet of paper\nfrom his robes; a moment later, words began to appear on it,\naccompanied by tiny wisps of smoke. When the smoke had stopped\nrising, the paper floated over toward the woman.",
      "The woman looked over the paper with raised eyebrows, gave a\nsardonic snort. \"This had better work, Jeremy, or my last will and\ntestament says that my whole estate goes into putting a bounty on\nyour head. Speaking of which -\"",
      "The Defense Professor reached again into his robes and tossed\nthe witch a bag that made a clinking sound. The witch caught it,\nweighed it, made a pleased sound.",
      "Then she stood up, and the pale skeletal woman floated off the\nground beside her. \"I'm heading back,\" said the witch. \"I can't\nstart my work here.\"",
      "\"Wait,\" said the Defense Professor, and with a gesture retrieved\nhis wand from Bellatrix's hand and harness. Then his hand pointed\nthe wand at Bellatrix, and moved in a small circular gesture,\naccompanied by a quiet, \"Obliviate.\"",
      "\"That's it,\" snapped the witch, \"I'm taking her out of\nhere before anyone does her any more damage -\" One arm came around\nto hug the bony form of Bellatrix Black to her side, and they both\ndisappeared with the loud POP! of Apparition.",
      "And there was silence in that lumpy place, but for the gentle\nrush of the passing waves, and a little breath of wind.",
      "I think the performance is finished, said the Inner\nCritic. I give it two and a half out of five stars. She's\nprobably not a very experienced actor.",
      "I wonder if a real healer would seem more fake than an actor\ntold to play one? mused Ravenclaw.",
      "Like watching a television show, that was how it felt, like\nwatching a television show whose characters you didn't particularly\nempathize with, that was all that could be seen and felt from\nbehind the glass walls.",
      "Somehow, Harry managed to move his lips himself, send his own\nvoice out into the still dawn air, and then was surprised to hear\nhis own question. \"How many different people are you, anyway?\"",
      "The pale man lying on the ground didn't laugh, but from the\nbroomstick Harry's eyes saw the sides of Professor Quirrell's lips\ncurling up, the edge of that familiar sardonic smile. \"I cannot say\nthat I bothered keeping count. How many are you?\"",
      "It shouldn't have shaken the inner Harry so much, hearing that\nresponse, and yet he felt - he felt - unstable, like his own center\nhad been subtracted -",
      "Oh.",
      "\"Excuse me,\" said Harry's voice. It now sounded as distant and\ndetached as the fading Harry felt. \"I'm going to faint in a few\nseconds, I think.\"",
      "\"Use the fourth portkey I gave you, the one I said was our\nfallback refuge,\" said the man lying on the ground, calmly but\nswiftly. \"It will be safer there. And continue wearing your\ncloak.\"",
      "Harry's free hand retrieved another twig from his pouch and\nsnapped it.",
      "There was another portkey yank, internationally long, and then\nhe was somewhere black.",
      "\"Lumos,\" said Harry's lips, some part of him looking\nout for the safety of the whole.",
      "He was inside what looked like a Muggle warehouse, a deserted\none.",
      "Harry's legs climbed off the broomstick, lay on the floor. His\neyes closed, and some tidy fraction of self willed his light to\nfail, before the darkness took him.",
      "\"Where will you go?\" yelled Amelia. They were almost at the edge\nof the wards.",
      "\"Backward in time to protect Harry Potter,\" said the old wizard,\nand before Amelia could even open her lips to ask if he wanted\nhelp, she felt the boundary of the wards as they crossed them.",
      "There was a pop of Apparition, and the wizard and the phoenix\nvanished, leaving behind the borrowed broomstick."

      "\"Wake.\"",
      "Harry's eyes flew open as he came awake with a choking gasp, a\njerking start of his prone body. He couldn't remember any dreams,\nmaybe his brain had been too exhausted to dream, it seemed like\nhe'd only closed his eyes and then heard that word spoken a moment\nafter.",
      "\"You must awaken,\" said the voice of Quirinus Quirrell. \"I gave\nyou as much time as I could, but it would be wise to reserve at\nleast one use of your Time-Turner. Soon we must go backward four\nhours to Mary's Place, appearing in every way as though we have\ndone nothing interesting this day. I wished to speak to you before\nthen.\"",
      "Harry slowly sat up in the midst of darkness. His body ached,\nand not only in the places where it had laid on the hard concrete.\nImages tumbled over each other in his memory, everything his\nunconscious brain had been too tired to discharge into a proper\nnightmare.",
      "Twelve terrible voids floating down a metal corridor, tarnishing\nthe metal around them, light dimmed and temperature falling as the\nemptiness tried to suck all life out of the world -",
      "Chalk-white skin, stretched just above the bone that had\nremained after fat and muscle faded -",
      "A metal door -",
      "A woman's voice -",
      "No, I didn't mean it, please don't die -",
      "I can't remember my children's names any more -",
      "Don't go, don't take it away, don't don't don't -",
      "\"What was that place?\" Harry said hoarsely, in a voice pushed\nout of his throat like water forced through a too-thin pipe, in the\ndarkness it sounded almost as shattered as Bellatrix Black's voice\nhad been. \"What was that place? That wasn't a prison, that was\nHELL!\u202f\"",
      "\"Hell?\" said the calm voice of the Defense Professor. \"You mean\nthe Christian punishment fantasy? I suppose there is a\nsimilarity.\"",
      "\"How -\" Harry's voice was blocking, there was something huge\nlodged in his throat. \"How - how could they -\" People had\nbuilt that place, someone had made Azkaban, they'd made it\non purpose, they'd done it deliberately, that\nwoman, she'd had children, children she wouldn't remember, some\njudge had decided for that to happen to her, someone had\nneeded to drag her into that cell and lock its door while\nshe screamed, someone fed her every day and walked away without\nletting her out -",
      "\"HOW COULD PEOPLE DO THAT?\u202f\"",
      "\"Why shouldn't they?\" said the Defense Professor. A pale blue\nlight lit the warehouse, then, showing a high, cavernous concrete\nceiling, and a dusty concrete floor; and Professor Quirrell sitting\nsome distance away from Harry, leaning his back against a painted\nwall; the pale blue light turned the walls to glacier surfaces, the\ndust on the floor to speckled snow, and the man himself had become\nan ice sculpture, shrouded in darkness where his black robes lay\nover him. \"What use are the prisoners of Azkaban to them?\"",
      "Harry's mouth opened in a croak. No words exited.",
      "A faint smile twitched on the Defense Professor's lips. \"You\nknow, Mr. Potter, if He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named had come to rule over\nmagical Britain, and built such a place as Azkaban, he would have\nbuilt it because he enjoyed seeing his enemies suffer. And if\ninstead he began to find their suffering distasteful, why, he would\norder Azkaban torn down the next day. As for those who did make\nAzkaban, and those who do not tear it down, while preaching lofty\nsermons and imagining themselves not to be villains...\nwell, Mr. Potter, I think if I had my choice of taking tea with\nthem, or taking tea with You-Know-Who, I should find my\nsensibilities less offended by the Dark Lord.\"",
      "\"I don't understand,\" Harry said, his voice was shaking, he'd\nread about the classic experiment on the psychology of prisons, the\nordinary college students who had turned sadistic as soon as they\nwere assigned the role of prison guards; only now he realized that\nthe experiment hadn't examined the right question, the one most\nimportant question, they hadn't looked at the key people, not the\nprison guards but everyone else, \"I really don't\nunderstand, Professor Quirrell, how can people just stand by and\nlet this happen, why is the country of magical Britain\ndoing this -\" Harry's voice stopped.",
      "The Defense Professor's eyes appeared to be the same color as\nalways, in the pale blue light, for that light was the same color\nas Quirinus Quirrell's irises, those never-thawing chips of ice.\n\"Welcome, Mr. Potter, to your first encounter with the realities of\npolitics. What do the wretched creatures in Azkaban have to offer\nany faction? Who would benefit from aiding them? A politician who\nopenly sided with them would associate themselves with criminals,\nwith weakness, with distasteful things that people would rather not\nthink about. Alternatively, the politician could demonstrate their\nmight and cruelty by calling for longer sentences; to make a\ndisplay of strength requires a victim to crush beneath you, after\nall. And the populace applauds, for it is their instinct to back\nthe winner.\" A coldly amused laugh. \"You see, Mr. Potter, no one\never quite believes that they will go to Azkaban, so they\nsee no harm in it for themselves. As for what they inflict on\nothers... I suppose you were once told that people care about that\nsort of thing? It is a lie, Mr. Potter, people don't care in the\nslightest, and if you had not led a vastly sheltered childhood you\nwould have noticed that long ago. Console yourself with this: those\nnow prisoner in Azkaban voted for the same Ministers of Magic who\npledged to move their cells closer to the Dementors. I admit, Mr.\nPotter, that I see little hope for democracy as an effective form\nof government, but I admire the poetry of how it makes its victims\ncomplicit in their own destruction.\"",
      "Harry's recently cohered self was threatening to shatter into\nfragments again, the words falling like hammerstrikes on his\nconsciousness, driving him back, step by step, over the precipice\nwhere lurked some vast abyss; and he was trying to find something\nto save himself, some clever retort that would refute the words,\nbut it did not come.",
      "The Defense Professor watched Harry, the gaze reflecting more\ncuriosity than command. \"It is very simple, Mr. Potter, to\nunderstand how Azkaban was built, and how it continues to be. Men\ncare for what they, themselves, expect to suffer or gain; and so\nlong as they do not expect it to redound upon themselves, their\ncruelty and carelessness is without limit. All the other wizards of\nthis country are no different within than he who sought to rule\nover them, You-Know-Who; they only lack his power and his...\nfrankness.\"",
      "The boy's hands were clenched into fists so tightly that the\nnails cut into his palm, if his fingers were white or his face was\npale you couldn't have seen that, for the dim blue light cast all\ninto ice or shadow. \"You once offered to support me if my ambition\nwere to be the next Dark Lord. Is that why, Professor?\"",
      "The Defense Professor inclined his head, a thin smile on his\nlips. \"Learn all that I have to teach you, Mr. Potter, and you will\nrule this country in time. Then you may tear down the prison that\ndemocracy made, if you find that Azkaban still offends your\nsensibilities. Like it or not, Mr. Potter, you have seen this day\nthat your own will conflicts with the will of this country's\npopulace, and that you do not bow your head and submit to their\ndecision when that occurs. So to them, whether or not they know it,\nand whether or not you acknowledge it, you are their next Dark\nLord.\"",
      "In the monochromatic light, unwavering, the boy and the Defense\nProfessor both seemed like motionless ice sculptures, the irises of\ntheir eyes reduced to similar colors, looking very much the same in\nthat light.",
      "Harry stared directly into those pale eyes. All the\nlong-suppressed questions, the ones he'd told himself he was\nputting on hold until the Ides of May. That had been a lie, Harry\nnow knew, a self-deception, he had kept silent for fear of what he\nmight hear. And now everything was coming forth from his lips, all\nat once. \"On our first day of class, you tried to convince my\nclassmates I was a killer.\"",
      "\"You are.\" Amusedly. \"But if your question is why I\ntold them that, Mr. Potter, the answer is that you will\nfind ambiguity a great ally on your road to power. Give a sign of\nSlytherin on one day, and contradict it with a sign of Gryffindor\nthe next; and the Slytherins will be enabled to believe what they\nwish, while the Gryffindors argue themselves into supporting you as\nwell. So long as there is uncertainty, people can believe whatever\nseems to be to their own advantage. And so long as you appear\nstrong, so long as you appear to be winning, their instincts will\ntell them that their advantage lies with you. Walk always in the\nshadow, and light and darkness both will follow.\"",
      "\"And,\" said the boy, his voice level, \"just what do you\nwant out of all this?\"",
      "Professor Quirrell had leaned further back against the wall from\nwhere he sat, casting his face into shadow, his eyes changing from\npale ice into dark pits like those of his snake form. \"I wish for\nBritain to grow strong under a strong leader; that is my\ndesire. As for my reasons why,\" Professor Quirrell smiled without\nmirth, \"I think they shall stay my own.\"",
      "\"The sense of doom that I feel around you.\" The words were\nbecoming harder and harder to say, as the subject danced closer and\ncloser to something terrible and forbidden. \"You always knew what\nit meant.\"",
      "\"I had several guesses,\" said Professor Quirrell, his expression\nunreadable. \"And I will not yet say all I guessed. But this much I\nwill tell you: it is your doom which flares when we come\nnear, not mine.\"",
      "For once Harry's brain managed to mark this as a questionable\nassertion and possible lie, instead of believing everything it\nheard. \"Why do you sometimes turn into a zombie?\"",
      "\"Personal reasons,\" said Professor Quirrell with no humor at all\nin his voice.",
      "\"What was your ulterior motive for rescuing Bellatrix?\"",
      "There was a brief silence, during which Harry tried hard to\ncontrol his breathing, keep it steady.",
      "Finally the Defense Professor shrugged, as though it were of no\naccount. \"I all but spelled it out for you, Mr. Potter. I told you\neverything you needed to deduce the answer, if you had been mature\nenough to consider that first obvious question. Bellatrix Black was\nthe Dark Lord's most powerful servant, her loyalty the most\nassured; she was the single person most likely to be entrusted with\nsome part of the lost lore of Slytherin that should have been\nyours.\"",
      "Slowly the anger crept over Harry, slowly the wrath, something\nterrible beginning to boil his blood, in just a few moments he\nwould say something that he really shouldn't say while the two of\nthem were alone in a deserted warehouse -",
      "\"But she was innocent,\" said the Defense Professor. He\nwas not smiling. \"And the degree to which all her choices were\ntaken away from her, so that she never had a chance to suffer for\nher own mistakes... it struck me as excessive,\nMr. Potter. If she tells you nothing of use -\" The Defense\nProfessor gave another small shrug. \"I shall not consider this\nday's work a waste.\"",
      "\"How altruistic of you,\" Harry said coldly. \"So if all wizards\nare like You-Know-Who inside, are you an exception to that,\nthen?\"",
      "The Defense Professor's eyes were still in shadow, dark pits\nthat could not be met. \"Call it a whim, Mr. Potter. It has\nsometimes amused me to play the part of a hero. Who knows but that\nYou-Know-Who would say the same.\"",
      "Harry opened his mouth a final time -",
      "And found that he couldn't say it, he couldn't ask the last\nquestion, the last and most important question, he couldn't make\nthe words come out. Even though a refusal like that was forbidden\nto a rationalist, for all that he'd ever recited the Litany of\nTarski or the Litany of Gendlin or sworn that whatever could be\ndestroyed by the truth should be, in that one moment, he could not\nbring himself to say his last question out loud. Even though he\nknew he was thinking wrongly, even though he knew he was supposed\nto be better than this, he still couldn't say it.",
      "\"Now it is my turn to inquire of you.\" Professor Quirrell's back\nstraightened from where it had leaned back against the glacier wall\nof painted concrete. \"I was wondering, Mr. Potter, if you had\nanything to say about nearly killing me and ruining our mutual\nendeavor. I am given to understand that an apology, in such cases,\nis considered a sign of respect. But you have not offered me one.\nIs it just that you have not yet gotten around to it, Mr.\nPotter?\"",
      "The tone was calm, the quiet edge so fine and sharp that it\nwould slice all the way through you before you realized you were\nbeing murdered.",
      "And Harry just looked at the Defense Professor with cool eyes\nthat would never flinch from anything; not even death, now. He was\nno longer in Azkaban, no longer fearful of the part of himself that\nwas fearless; and the solid gemstone that was Harry had rotated to\nmeet the stress, turning smoothly from one facet to another, from\nlight to darkness, warm to cold.",
      "A calculated ploy on his part, to make me feel guilty, put\nme in a position where I must submit?",
      "Genuine emotion on his part?",
      "\"I see,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"I suppose that answers -\"",
      "\"No,\" said the boy in a cool, collected voice, \"you do not get\nto frame the conversation that easily, Professor. I went to\nconsiderable lengths to protect you and get you out of Azkaban\nsafely, after I thought you had tried to kill a police\nofficer. That included facing down twelve Dementors without a\nPatronus Charm. I wonder, if I had apologized when you demanded it,\nwould you have said thank-you in turn? Or am I correct in thinking\nthat it was my submission you demanded there, and not only my\nrespect?\"",
      "There was a pause, and then Professor Quirrell's voice came in\nreply, openly icy with danger no longer veiled. \"It seems you still\ncannot bring yourself to lose, Mr. Potter.\"",
      "Darkness stared out of Harry's eyes without flinching, the\nDefense Professor himself reduced to a mortal thing within them.\n\"Oh, and are you pondering now, whether you\nshould pretend to lose to me, and pretend to humble yourself before\nmy own anger, in order to preserve your own plans? Did the thought\nof a calculated false apology even cross your mind? Me\nneither, Professor Quirrell.\"",
      "The Defense Professor laughed, low and humorless, emptier than\nthe void between the stars, dangerous as any vacuum filled with\nhard radiation. \"No, Mr. Potter, you have not learned your lesson,\nnot at all.\"",
      "\"I thought of losing many times, in Azkaban,\" said the boy, his\nvoice level. \"That I ought to simply give up, and turn myself over\nto the Aurors. Losing would have been the sensible thing to do. I\nheard your voice saying it to me, in my mind; and I would have\ndone it, if I had been there by myself. But I could not\nbring myself to lose you.\"",
      "There was silence, then, for a time; as though even the Defense\nProfessor could not quite think of what to say to that.",
      "\"I am curious,\" said Professor Quirrell at last. \"What do you\nthink that I should apologize for, precisely? I gave you explicit\ninstructions in the event of a fight. You were to stay down, stay\nout of the way, cast no magic. You violated those instructions and\nbrought down the mission.\"",
      "\"I made no decision,\" the boy said evenly, \"there was no choice\nin it, only a wish that the Auror should not die, and my Patronus\nwas there. For that wish to have never occurred, you should have\nwarned me that you might bluff using a Killing Curse. By default, I\nassume that if you point your wand at someone and say Avada\nKedavra, it is because you want them dead. Shouldn't that be the\nfirst rule of Unforgivable Curse Safety?\"",
      "\"Rules are for duels,\" said the Defense Professor. Some of the\ncoldness had returned to his voice. \"And dueling is a sport, not a\nbranch of Battle Magic. In a real fight, a curse which cannot be\nblocked and must be dodged is an indispensable tactic. I\nwould have thought this obvious to you, but it seems I misjudged\nyour intellect.\"",
      "\"It also seems to me imprudent,\" said the boy, continuing as\nthough the other had not spoken, \"to not tell me that my\ncasting any spell on you might kill us both. What if you had\nsuffered some mishap, and I had tried an Innervate, or a Hover\nCharm? That ignorance, which you permitted for purposes I cannot\nguess, played also some part in this catastrophe.\"",
      "There was another silence. The Defense Professor's eyes had\nnarrowed, and there was a faintly puzzled look on his face, as\nthough he had encountered some completely unfamiliar situation; and\nstill the man spoke no word.",
      "\"Well,\" said the boy. His eyes had not wavered from the Defense\nProfessor's. \"I certainly regret hurting you, Professor. But I do\nnot think the situation calls for me to submit to you. I never\nreally did understand the concept of apology, still less as it\napplies to a situation like this; if you have my regrets, but not\nmy submission, does that count as saying sorry?\"",
      "Again that cold, cold laugh, darker than the void between the\nstars.",
      "\"I wouldn't know,\" said the Defense Professor, \"I, too, never\nunderstood the concept of apology. That ploy would be futile\nbetween us, it seems, with both of us knowing it for a lie. Let us\nspeak no more of it, then. Debts will be settled between us in\ntime.\"",
      "There was silence for a time.",
      "\"By the way,\" said the boy. \"Hermione Granger would never have\nbuilt Azkaban, no matter who was going to be put in it. And she'd\ndie before she hurt an innocent. Just mentioning that, since you\nsaid before that all wizards are like You-Know-Who inside, and\nthat's just false as a point of simple fact. Would've realized it\nearlier if I hadn't been,\" the boy gave a brief grim smile,\n\"stressed out.\"",
      "The Defense Professor's eyes were half-lidded, his expression\ndistant. \"People's insides are not always like their outsides, Mr.\nPotter. Perhaps she simply wishes others to think of her as a good\ngirl. She cannot use the Patronus Charm -\"",
      "\"Hah,\" said the boy; his smile seemed realer now, warmer. \"She's\nhaving trouble for exactly the same reason I did. There's enough\nlight in her to destroy Dementors, I'm sure. She wouldn't be able\nto stop herself from destroying Dementors, even at the\ncost of her own life...\" The boy trailed off, and then his voice\nresumed. \"I might not be such a good person, maybe; but\nthey do exist, and she's one of them.\"",
      "Dryly. \"She is young, and to make a show of kindness costs her\nlittle.\"",
      "There was a pause at this. Then the boy said, \"Professor, I have\nto ask, when you see something all dark and gloomy, doesn't it ever\noccur to you to try and improve it somehow? Like, yes,\nsomething goes terribly wrong in people's heads that makes them\nthink it's great to torture criminals, but that doesn't mean\nthey're truly evil inside; and maybe if you taught them the right\nthings, showed them what they were doing wrong, you could change\n-\"",
      "Professor Quirrell laughed, then, and not with the emptiness of\nbefore. \"Ah, Mr. Potter, sometimes I do forget how very young you\nare. Sooner you could change the color of the sky.\" Another\nchuckle, this one colder. \"And the reason it is easy for you to\nforgive such fools and think well of them, Mr. Potter, is that you\nyourself have not been sorely hurt. You will think less fondly of\ncommonplace idiots after the first time their folly costs you\nsomething dear. Such as a hundred Galleons from your own pocket,\nperhaps, rather than the agonizing deaths of a hundred strangers.\"\nThe Defense Professor was smiling thinly. He took a pocket-watch\nout of his robes, looked at it. \"Let us depart now, if there is\nnothing more to say between us.\"",
      "\"You don't have any questions about the impossible things I did\nto get us out of Azkaban?\"",
      "\"No,\" said the Defense Professor. \"I believe I have solved most\nof them already. As for the rest, it is too rare that I find a\nperson whom I cannot see through immediately, be they friend or\nfoe. I shall unravel the puzzles about you for myself, in due\ntime.\"",
      "The Defense Professor shoved himself up, pushing back on the\nwall with both hands and rising to his feet, smoothly if too\nslowly. The boy, less gracefully, did the same.",
      "And the boy blurted out the last most terrible question which he\nhad earlier been unable to ask; as though to say it aloud would\nmake it real, and as though it were not, already, vastly\nobvious.",
      "\"Why am I not like the other children my own age?\"",
      "In a deserted side-road of Diagon Alley, where scraps of\nun-Vanished trash could be seen lodged into the edges of the brick\nstreet and the blank brick building-sides that surrounded it, along\nwith scattered dirt and other signs of neglect, an ancient wizard\nand his phoenix Apparated into existence.",
      "The wizard was already reaching within his robes for his\nhourglass when, in habit, his eyes jumped to a random spot between\nthe road and the wall, to memorize it -",
      "And the old wizard blinked in surprise; there was a scrap of\nparchment in that spot.",
      "A frown crossed Albus Dumbledore's face as he took a step\nforward and took the crumpled scrap, unfolding it.",
      "On it was the single word \"NO\", and nothing more.",
      "Slowly the wizard let it flutter from his fingers. Absently he\nreached down to the pavement, and picked up the nearest scrap of\nparchment, which looked remarkably similar to the one he had just\ntaken; he touched it with his wand, and a moment later it was\ninscribed with the same word \"NO\", in the same handwriting, which\nwas his own.",
      "The old wizard had planned to go back three hours to when Harry\nPotter first arrived in Diagon Alley. He had already watched, upon\nhis instruments, the boy leaving Hogwarts, and that could not be\nundone (his one attempt to fool his own instruments, and so control\nTime without altering its appearance to himself, had ended in\nsufficient disaster to convince him to never again try such\ntrickery). He had hoped to retrieve the boy at the first possible\nmoment after his arrival, and take him to another safe location, if\nnot Hogwarts (for his instruments had not shown the boy's return).\nBut now -",
      "\"A paradox if I retrieve him immediately after he arrives in\nDiagon Alley?\" murmured the old wizard to himself. \"Perhaps they\ndid not set in motion their plan to rob Azkaban, until after they\nhad confirmed his arrival here... or else... perhaps...\"",
      "Painted concrete, hard floor and distant ceilings, two figures\nfacing off across from each other. One entity who wore the shape of\na man in his late thirties and already balding, and another mind\nthat wore the form of an eleven-year-old boy with a scar upon his\nforehead. Ice and shadow, pale blue light.",
      "\"I don't know,\" said the man.",
      "The boy just looked at him. And then said, \"Oh, really?\"",
      "\"Truly,\" said the man. \"I know nothing, and of my guesses I will\nnot speak. Yet I will say this much -\""

      "Through green flame they whirled, through the Floo network they\nspun, Minerva's heart racing with a pounding horror that she hadn't\nfelt in ten years and three months, the corridors between space\ncoughed and spit them out into the lobby of Gringotts (the safest\nFloo receiver in Diagon Alley, the connection most difficult to\nintercept, the fastest way out of Hogwarts without a phoenix). A\ngoblin attendant turned toward them, his eyes widened, he began a\nslightly respectful bow -",
      "Determination, Destination, Deliberation!",
      "And the two of them were in the alley just in back of Mary's\nPlace, wands already out and raised, spinning around back-to-back\nand the words of an Anti-Disillusionment Charm already rising to\nSeverus's lips.",
      "The alley was empty.",
      "When she turned back to look at Severus, his wand was already\ncracking down on his own head with a sound like smashing an egg, as\nhis lips chanted words of invisibility; he took on the colors of\nhis surroundings, became a blur of his surroundings, the blur moved\nand matched what was behind him and then there was nothing\nthere.",
      "She lowered her wand and stepped forward to receive her own\nDisillusionment -",
      "From behind her, the unmistakable sound of a burst of flame.",
      "She spun and saw Albus there, his long wand already drawn and\nraised in his right hand. His eyes were grim beneath the\nhalf-circles of his glasses, and Fawkes upon his shoulder had\nspread his fire-colored wings in readiness for flight and\nfight.",
      "\"Albus!\" she said. \"I thought -\" She'd just seen him depart for\nAzkaban, and she'd thought not even phoenixes could return from\nthere so easily.",
      "Then she realized.",
      "\"She escaped,\" said Albus. \"Did your Patronus reach him?\"",
      "The pounding in her heart grew stronger, the horror in her veins\nsolidified. \"He said he was here, in the washroom -\"",
      "\"Let us hope he spoke true,\" said Albus, the wand tapped her\nhead with a sensation like water trickling over her, and a moment\nlater the four of them (even Fawkes had been rendered invisible,\nthough sometimes you saw a flicker of something like fire in his\nair) were racing to the front of the restaurant. They paused before\nthe door while Albus whispered something, and a moment later one of\nthe customers visible through the windows stood up with a vague\nlook on his face and opened the door as though taking a quick look\noutside for some friend; and the three of them were through, racing\npast the unwitting customers (Severus was marking their faces,\nMinerva knew, and Albus would see any Disillusioned) toward the\nsign that pointed to the washroom -",
      "An old wooden door marked with the sign of a toilet burst open\nwith a slam, and four invisible rescuers stormed through it.",
      "The small but clean wooden room was empty, fresh droplets of\nwater showed in the sink but there was no sign of Harry, only a\nsheet of paper left on the closed lid of the toilet.",
      "She couldn't breathe.",
      "The sheet of paper rose up into the air as Albus took it, and a\nmoment later was thrust in her own direction.",
      "M: What did the hat tell me to tell you?",
      "- H",
      "\"Ah,\" Minerva said aloud in surprise, her mind taking a moment\nto place the question, it wasn't the sort of thing you'd forget but\nshe hadn't been thinking in that mode, really - \"I'm an\nimpudent youngster and I should get off its lawn.\"",
      "\"Eh?\u202f\" said the air in Albus's voice, as if even he\ncould be shocked.",
      "And then Harry Potter's head appeared, suspended next to the air\nbeside the toilet, his face was cold and alert, the too-adult Harry\nshe'd seen sometimes, eyes darting back and forth and around.",
      "\"What's going on -\" the boy began.",
      "Albus, now visible once more along with her and Fawkes, was\nmoving forward in an instant, his left hand reached forward and\nplucked a hair from Harry's head (producing a startled yelp from\nthe boy), Minerva accepted the hair in her own hand, and a moment\nlater Albus swept up the mostly-invisible boy in his arms and there\nwas a flash of red-golden fire.",
      "And Harry Potter was safe.",
      "Minerva took a few steps forward, leaned against the wall where\nAlbus and Harry had been, trying to recover her poise.",
      "She'd... lost some habits, in the ten years since the Order of\nthe Phoenix had disbanded.",
      "Beside her, Severus shimmered into visibility. His right hand\nwas already drawing forth the flask from his robes, his left hand\nalready stretching forth in demand. She gave him Harry's hair, and\na moment later, it dropped into the flask of unfinished Polyjuice,\nwhich at once began fizzing and bubbling as it settled into the\npotency that would enable Severus to act his part as bait.",
      "\"That was unexpected,\" the Potions Master said slowly. \"Why did\nour Headmaster not retrieve Mr. Potter earlier, I wonder,\nif he was going so far as to twist Time? There should have been\nnothing preventing him from doing so... indeed, your Patronus\nshould have found Mr. Potter already safe...\"",
      "She hadn't thought of that, a different realization having\njumped to the forefront of her mind. It wasn't nearly as horrifying\nas Bellatrix Black having escaped from Azkaban, but still -",
      "\"Harry has an invisibility cloak?\u202f\" she said.",
      "The Potions Master did not answer; he was shrinking.",
      "Tick-snick, drip-blip, ding-ring-ting-",
      "It still annoyed her, though it faded past attention after a\nwhile; and when and if she became Headmistress, she intended to\nSilence the whole lot. Which Head of Hogwarts, she wondered, had\nfirst been so inconsiderate as to create a device that made\nnoise, to pass on to their successors?",
      "She was sitting in the Headmaster's office with a quickly\nTransfigured desk of her own, doing some of the hundred little\npieces of necessary paperwork that kept Hogwarts from grinding to a\nhalt; she could lose herself in it easily, and it prevented her\nfrom thinking about other things. Albus had once remarked, sounding\nrather wry, that Hogwarts seemed to run even more smoothly when\nthere was an outside crisis for her to avoid thinking about...",
      "...ten years ago, that was the last time Albus had said\nthat.",
      "There was the chime that indicated an approaching visitor.",
      "Minerva kept reading her current parchment.",
      "The door slammed open, revealing Severus Snape, who took three\nsteps inward and demanded without the slightest pause, \"Any word\nfrom Mad-Eye?\"",
      "Albus was already rising from his chair, even as she tucked away\nher parchments and dispelled the desk. \"Moody's Patronus is\nreporting to the me in Azkaban,\" Albus said. \"His Eye saw nothing;\nand if the Eye of Vance does not see a thing, then that thing does\nnot exist. Yourself?\"",
      "\"No one has tried to forcibly take my blood,\" Severus said. He\ngave a quick grimace of a smile. \"Except the Defense\nProfessor.\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" said Minerva.",
      "\"He saw me for an impostor before I could even open my lips, and\nquite reasonably attacked me on the spot, demanding to know the\nwhereabouts of Mr. Potter.\" Another grimace of a smile. \"Shouting\nthat I was Severus Snape did not seem to reassure him, for some\nreason. I do believe that man would kill me for a Sickle and give\nback five Knuts change. I had to stun our good Professor Quirrell,\nwhich was not easy, and then he reacted poorly to the hex. 'Harry\nPotter', naturally alarmed, ran out and told the owner, and the\nDefense Professor was taken to St. Mungos -\"",
      "\"St. Mungos?\u202f\"",
      "\"- which said he had probably been overworking himself for weeks\nbefore he collapsed, such was his state of exhaustion. Your\nprecious Defense Professor is fine, Minerva, the stunner may have\nhelped him by forcing him to take a few days off. Afterward I\ndeclined the offer of a Floo to Hogwarts, and went back to Diagon\nAlley and wandered; but no one seems to have wanted Mr. Potter's\nblood today.\"",
      "\"Our Defense Professor is in the best of hands, I am sure,\" said\nAlbus. \"Greater matters command our attention, Minerva.\"",
      "It took considerable effort for her to wrench her attention\nback, but she sat back down, and Severus gestured up a chair for\nhimself as well, and the three of them drew together to begin their\ncouncil.",
      "She felt like a Polyjuiced impostor, sitting with those two. War\nwas not her art, nor plotting. She had to strain to keep one step\nahead of the Weasley twins, and sometimes she failed at that. She\nwas sitting here, ultimately, only because she had heard the\nprophecy...",
      "\"We are faced,\" the Headmaster spoke first, \"with a rather\nalarming mystery. I can think of only two wizards who might have\nengineered this escape.\"",
      "Minerva drew in her breath sharply. \"There is a chance it is\nnot You-Know-Who?\"",
      "\"I'm afraid so,\" said the Headmaster.",
      "She glanced to her side and saw that Severus looked as puzzled\nas herself. Afraid the Dark Lord was not rising again? She\nwould have given almost anything for that to be true.",
      "\"So,\" Albus said heavily. \"Our first suspect is Voldemort, risen\nagain and seeking to resurrect himself. I have studied many books I\nwish I had not read, seeking his every possible avenue of return,\nand I have found only three. His strongest road to life is the\nPhilosopher's Stone, which Flamel assures me that not even\nVoldemort could create on his own; by that road he would rise\ngreater and more terrible than ever before. I would not have\nthought Voldemort able to resist the temptation of the Stone, still\nless because such an obvious trap is a challenge to his wit. But\nhis second avenue is nearly as strong: The flesh of his servant,\nwillingly given; the blood of his foe, forcibly taken; and the bone\nof his ancestor, unknowingly bequeathed. Voldemort is a\nperfectionist -\" Albus glanced at Severus, who nodded agreement, \"-\nand he would certainly seek the most powerful combination: the\nflesh of Bellatrix Black, the blood of Harry Potter, and the bone\nof his father. Voldemort's final avenue is to seduce a victim and\ndrain the life from them over a long period; in which case\nVoldemort would be weak compared to his former power. His motive to\nspirit away Bellatrix is clear. And if he is keeping her in\nreserve, to use only in case he cannot attain the Stone, that would\nexplain why no kidnap attempt was made on Harry this day.\"",
      "Minerva glanced again at Severus, saw him listening attentively\nbut without surprise.",
      "\"What is not clear,\" the Headmaster continued, \"is\nhow Voldemort could have engineered this escape. A death\ndoll was left in Bellatrix's place, her escape was meant to be\nundetected; and even though that went wrong, the Dementors could\nnot find her after their first warning. Azkaban has stood\nimpenetrable for centuries, and I cannot imagine any means by which\nVoldemort could have accomplished this.\"",
      "\"That may mean little,\" Severus said, expressionless. \"For the\nDark Lord to do what we cannot imagine requires only that he has a\nbetter imagination.\"",
      "Albus nodded grimly. \"Unfortunately there is now another wizard\nwho laughs at impossibilities. A wizard who, not long ago,\ndeveloped a new and powerful Charm which could have blinded the\nDementors to Bellatrix Black's escape. And he is implicated for\nother reasons, as well.\"",
      "Minerva's heart was skipping beats, she didn't know\nhow, or why, but a terrible apprehension was\ndawning on her as to who -",
      "\"Who would that be?\" said Severus, sounding\npuzzled.",
      "Albus leaned back and said the fatal words, even as she had\nfeared them: \"Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres.\"",
      "\"Potter?\u202f\" demanded the Potions Master, as much shock\nin that usually-silken voice as she had ever heard from him.\n\"Headmaster, is this one of your jokes? He is in his first year at\nHogwarts! A temper tantrum and a few childish pranks with an\ninvisibility cloak does not make him -\"",
      "\"It is no joke,\" said Minerva, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\"Harry is already making original discoveries in Transfiguration,\nSeverus. Though I did not know he was researching Charms as\nwell.\"",
      "\"Harry is no ordinary first-year,\" the Headmaster said solemnly.\n\"He is marked as the Dark Lord's equal, and he has power the Dark\nLord knows not.\"",
      "Severus was looking at her, and you would have needed to know\nhim well to recognize that his glance was pleading. \"Am I to take\nthis seriously?\"",
      "Minerva simply nodded.",
      "\"Does anyone else know of this... new and powerful\nCharm?\" Severus demanded.",
      "The Headmaster glanced at her apologetically -",
      "Somehow she knew, she knew before he even said it, and she\nwanted to scream at the top of her lungs.",
      "- and said, \"Quirinus Quirrell.\"",
      "\"Why,\" she said, in a voice that should have melted\nhalf the devices in the office, \"did Mr. Potter even TELL our\nDefense Professor about his brilliant new Charm for breaking out of\nprisons -\"",
      "The Headmaster passed a weary wrinkled hand across his equally\nwrinkled forehead. \"Quirinus just happened to be there, Minerva.\nEven I saw no harm in it at the time.\" The Headmaster hesitated.\n\"And Harry said his Charm was too dangerous to be explained to\neither of us; and when I asked him again, this day, he insisted he\nhad still not explained it to Quirinus, nor had he ever dropped his\nOcclumency barriers in the Defense Professor's presence -\"",
      "\"Mr. Potter is an Occlumens? You gave him an\ninvisibility cloak and he is immune to Veritaserum and he is\nfriends with the Weasley twins? Albus, do you have any idea\nwhat you have unleashed upon this school?\" Her voice was nearly\nshrieking, now. \"By his seventh year there won't be anything left\nof Hogwarts but a smoking hole in the ground!\"",
      "Albus leaned back in his great cushioned chair, and said,\nsmiling, \"Don't forget the Time-Turner.\"",
      "She did scream then, but quietly.",
      "Severus drawled, \"Should I teach him to brew Polyjuice,\nHeadmaster? I ask only for the sake of completeness, in case you\nare not satisfied with the magnitude of your pet disaster.\"",
      "\"Perhaps next year,\" said Albus. \"My dearest friends, the\nquestion before us is whether Harry Potter has spirited Bellatrix\nBlack out of Azkaban, which is more than youthful high spirits even\nby my tolerant standards.\"",
      "\"Excuse me, Headmaster,\" Severus said with one of the dryer\nsmiles she had ever seen him deliver to Albus, \"but I will register\nmy opinion that the answer is no. This is the Dark Lord's work,\npure and simple.\"",
      "\"Then why,\" Albus said, and now there was no humor at all in his\nvoice, \"when I planned to retrieve Harry immediately after his\narrival in Diagon Alley, did I find that this would result in\nparadox?\"",
      "Minerva sank further back into her chair, dropped her left elbow\nonto the hard uncushioned armrest, leaned her head into her hand,\nand shut her eyes in despair.",
      "There was a narrowly circulated proverb to the effect that only\none Auror in thirty was qualified to investigate cases involving\nTime-Turners; and that of those few, the half who weren't\nalready insane, soon would be.",
      "\"So you suspect,\" Severus's voice was saying, \"that Potter went\nfrom Diagon Alley to Azkaban, then looped back to Diagon Alley\nafterward to be picked up by us -\"",
      "\"Precisely,\" said Albus's voice. \"Though it is also possible\nthat Voldemort or his servants watched to make sure Harry did\narrive in Diagon Alley, before they began their attempt on Azkaban.\nAnd that they had someone with a Time-Turner who would send back\nthe message of their success, to trigger the abduction. Indeed, it\nwas my suspicion of this possibility that caused me to dispatch you\nand Minerva on your own mission, before I myself went to Azkaban. I\nthought then that their breakout would fail, but if retrieving\nHarry Potter meant observing the fact of their eventual failure,\nthen I myself could not have gone to Azkaban after I had interacted\nwith him, for Azkaban's future cannot touch its past. When, in\nAzkaban, I received no report from you or Minerva, nor from\nFlitwick whom I told to try contacting you, I knew that your\ninteraction with Harry Potter had been an interaction with\nAzkaban's future, meaning that someone was sending messages through\nTime -\"",
      "Then Albus's voice stopped.",
      "\"But Headmaster,\" said Severus, \"you came back from\nAzkaban's future and interacted with us...\"",
      "The Potions Master's voice trailed off.",
      "\"But Severus, if I had received reports from you and\nMinerva of Harry's safety, I would not, in the first place, have\ngone backward in time to -\"",
      "\"Headmaster, I think we must draw diagrams for this.\"",
      "\"I agree, Severus.\"",
      "There was the sound of parchment being spread on a table, and\nthen quills scratching, and more arguing.",
      "Minerva sat in her chair, head resting in her hand, eyes\nshut.",
      "There was a story she'd once heard about a criminal who had\npossessed a Time-Turner which the Department of Mysteries had\nsealed to him, in a case of extremely bad judgment as to who needed\none; and there had been an Auror assigned to track down this\nunknown time-criminal, who had also been given a Time-Turner; and\nthe story ended with both of them in St. Mungo's ward for Total\nUnrecoverable Nutcases.",
      "Minerva sat there with her eyes shut, trying not to listen,\ntrying not to think about it, and trying not to go insane.",
      "After awhile, when the argument seemed to have wound down, she\nsaid aloud, \"Mr. Potter's Time-Turner is restricted to the hours of\nnine PM through midnight. Was the shell tampered with, Albus?\"",
      "\"Not to my most discerning Charms,\" said Albus. \"But the shells\nare new things; and to defeat the Unspeakables' precautions and\nleave no trace of the defeat... might not be\nimpossible.\"",
      "She opened her eyes, and saw Severus and the Headmaster staring\nintently at a parchment covered with tangled squiggles that would\nhave no doubt driven her mad to comprehend.",
      "\"Have you come to any conclusions?\u202f\" Minerva said. \"And\nplease don't tell me how you arrived at them.\"",
      "Severus and the Headmaster looked at each other, then turned to\nlook at her.",
      "\"We have concluded,\" the Headmaster said gravely, \"that either\nHarry was involved or he was not; that either Voldemort has access\nto a Time-Turner or he does not; and that regardless of what could\nhave happened within Azkaban, nobody would have visited the Little\nHangleton graveyard during the period Moody has already watched\nover it within my own past.\"",
      "\"In short,\" Severus drawled, \"we know nothing, dear Minerva;\nthough it seems at least likely that another Time-Turner\nwas involved, somehow. My own suspicion is that Potter has been\nbribed, tricked, or threatened into conveying messages backward in\ntime, perhaps even regarding this very prison break. I shall not\nmake the obvious suggestion as to who is pulling his strings. But I\nsuggest that at nine o' clock tonight, we test whether Potter is\nable to travel the full six hours backward to three o' clock, to\nsee if he has yet used his Time-Turner.\"",
      "\"That seems wise to do in any case,\" said Dumbledore. \"See that\ndone, Minerva, and tell Harry to stop in my office at his\nconvenience, afterward.\"",
      "\"But you still suspect Harry of direct involvement in the prison\nbreak itself?\" Minerva said.",
      "\"Possible but unlikely,\" said Severus, at the same time Albus\nsaid, \"Yes.\"",
      "Minerva pinched the bridge of her nose, took a deep breath, let\nit out. \"Albus, Severus, what possible reason has Mr.\nPotter to do such a thing!\"",
      "\"None that I can think of,\" said Albus, \"but it remains that\nHarry's magics alone, of all the means known to me, might have\n-\"",
      "\"Hold,\" said Severus. All expression vanished from his face. \"A\nthought occurs to me, I must check -\" The Potions Master seized a\npinch of Floo powder, strode across the room toward the fireplace -\nAlbus hastily waved his wand to light it - and then in a flare of\ngreen flame, and the words \"Slytherin Head of House office\",\nSeverus was gone.",
      "She and Albus looked at each other and both shrugged; and then\nAlbus turned back to studying the parchment.",
      "It was only a few minutes later that Severus spun back out of\nthe Floo, brushing traces of ash from himself.",
      "\"Well,\" said the Potions Master. Again the expressionless face.\n\"I am afraid that Mr. Potter does have a motive.\"",
      "\"Speak!\" said Albus.",
      "\"I found Lesath Lestrange in the Slytherin common room,\nstudying,\" Severus said. \"He was not reluctant to meet my eyes. And\nit seems that Mr. Lestrange did not like to think of his parents in\nAzkaban, in the cold and the darkness, with the Dementors sucking\naway their life, hurting every second of every day, and he told Mr.\nPotter so in as many words, and begged him to get them out. Since,\nyou see, Mr. Lestrange had heard that the Boy-Who-Lived could do\nanything.\"",
      "She and Albus exchanged glances.",
      "\"Severus,\" Minerva said, \"surely... even\nHarry... has more common sense than that...\"",
      "Her voice trailed off.",
      "\"Mr. Potter thinks he is God,\" Severus said without expression,\n\"and Lesath Lestrange fell to his knees before him in a heartfelt\ncry of prayer.\"",
      "Minerva stared at Severus, feeling sick to her stomach. She had\nstudied Muggle religion - it was the most common reason for needing\nto Memory-Charm the parents of Muggleborns - and she knew enough to\nunderstand what Severus had just said.",
      "\"In any case,\" said the Potions Master. \"I looked within Mr.\nLestrange to see if he knew anything of his mother's escape. He has\nheard nothing. But the instant he learns, he will conclude that the\nperson responsible was Harry Potter.\"",
      "\"I see...\" Albus said slowly. \"Thank you, Severus. That is good\nnews.\"",
      "\"Good news?\u202f\" Minerva burst out.",
      "Albus looked at her, his face as expressionless as Severus's,\nnow; and she remembered, with a shock, that Albus's own - \"It is\nthe best reason I can possibly imagine for removing Bellatrix from\nAzkaban,\" Albus said quietly. \"And if it is not Harry, let\nus recall, then it is certainly Voldemort himself making his first\nmoves. But let us not be hasty in judgment while there is much we\ndo not yet know, but soon will.\"",
      "Albus once more stood up from behind his desk, strode to the\nfireplace still alight, cast in another pinch of green powder, and\nstuck his head into the flames. \"Department of Magical Law\nEnforcement,\" he said, \"Director's office.\"",
      "After a moment, the voice of Madam Bones came through clear and\nsharp, \"What is it, Albus? I am somewhat busy.\"",
      "\"Amelia,\" said Albus, \"I beg of you to share any discoveries you\nhave made concerning this matter.\"",
      "There was a pause. \"Oh,\" said the cold voice of Madam Bones from\nthe blazing fire, \"and is that a two-way road then, Albus?\"",
      "\"It may be,\" the old wizard said calmly.",
      "\"If any Auror dies of your reticence, old meddler, I will hold\nyou responsible in full measure.\"",
      "\"I understand, Amelia,\" Albus said, \"but I have no wish to spark\nneedless alarm and incredulity -\"",
      "\"Bellatrix Black has escaped from Azkaban!\nWhat alarm or incredulity do you think I will call\nneedless, in the face of that?\"",
      "\"I may call on you to remember those words,\" said the old wizard\ninto the green flames. \"For if I learn that my fears are not\nneedless, I will tell you. Now, Amelia, I beg you, if you\nhave learned anything whatsoever upon this matter, please share\nit.\"",
      "There was another pause, and then Madam Bones's voice said, \"I\nhave information which I learned four hours into the future, Albus.\nDo you still want it?\"",
      "Albus paused -",
      "(weighing, Minerva knew, the possibility that he might want to\ngo back more than two hours from this instant; for you couldn't\nsend information further back in time than six hours, not through\nany chain of Time-Turners)",
      "- and finally said, \"Yes, please.\"",
      "\"We had a lucky break,\" said Madam Bones's voice, \"one of the\nAurors who witnessed the escape was a Muggleborn, and she told us\nthat the Flying-Fire spell, as we were calling it, might be no\nspell at all, but a Muggle artifact.\"",
      "Like a punch in the stomach, that was how it felt, and the\nsickness in Minerva's belly redoubled. Anyone who'd watched a Chaos\nLegion battle knew whose hand that showed...",
      "Madam Bones's voice continued. \"We brought in Arthur Weasley\nfrom Misuse of Muggle Artifacts - he knows more about Muggle\nartifacts than any wizard alive - and gave him the descriptions\nfrom the Aurors on the scene, and he cracked it. It was a Muggle\nartifact called a rocker, and they call it that because you'd have\nto be off your rocker to ride one. Just six years ago one of their\nrockers blew up, killed hundreds of Muggles in a flash and almost\nset fire to the Moon. Weasley says that rockers use a special kind\nof science called opposite reaction, so the plan is to develop a\njinx which will prevent that science from working around\nAzkaban.\"",
      "\"Thank you, Amelia,\" Albus said gravely. \"Is that\neverything?\"",
      "\"I'll check if we have anything from six hours forward,\" said\nthe voice of Madam Bones, \"if so they wouldn't have told me, but\nI'll have them tell you. Do you have anything you want to\ntell me, Albus? Which of those two possibilities is it looking\nlike?\"",
      "\"Not yet, Amelia,\" Albus said, \"but I may have word for you\nsoon.\"",
      "He straightened up from the fire, then, which faded back to\nordinary yellow flames. Every minute of the old wizard's years,\nevery natural second since his birth and every second which\nTime-Turning had added, all of that plus a few extra decades for\nstress, was visible on his lined face.",
      "\"Severus?\" the old wizard said. \"What was it actually?\"",
      "\"A rocket,\" said the half-blood Potions Master, who had grown up\nin the Muggle town of Spinner's End. \"One of the most impressive\nMuggle technologies.\"",
      "\"How likely is Harry to know such arts?\" said\nMinerva.",
      "Severus drawled, \"Oh, a boy like Mr. Potter knows all\nabout rockets; that, dear Minerva, is a certainty. You must\nremember that things are done differently in the Muggle world.\"\nSeverus frowned. \"But rockets are dangerous, and\nexpensive...\"",
      "\"Harry has stolen and hidden an unknown amount of money from his\nGringotts vault, perhaps thousands of Galleons,\" said the\nHeadmaster, and then, to their twin stares, \"That was not\nin my plan, but I made the mistake of sending the Defense Professor\nto supervise Harry's withdrawal of five Galleons for Christmas\npresents...\" The Headmaster shrugged. \"Yes, I agree, sheer folly in\nretrospect, let us continue.\"",
      "Minerva quietly thudded her head a few times against the\nheadrest of her chair.",
      "\"Nonetheless, Headmaster,\" Severus said. \"Just because the Death\nEaters never used Muggle artifacts in the first war, that does not\nmean he is ignorant. Rockets fell on Britain as weapons,\nin the Muggle side of Grindelwald's war. If he spent the summers of\nthose years in a Muggle orphanage, as you told us, Headmaster...\nthen he, too, has heard of rockets. And if he has been listening to\nreports of Mr. Potter and his mock battles using Muggle artifacts,\nhe would certainly learn his enemy's strengths and try to redouble\nthem himself. That is just how he thinks; any power he\nsees he will try to take for his own.\"",
      "The old wizard was standing stock still, utterly motionless,\neven the hairs of his beard frozen in place like solid wires; and\nthe thought came to Minerva, as frightening as any thought she'd\never had, that Albus Dumbledore was rooted to the spot in\nhorror.",
      "\"Severus,\" Albus Dumbledore said, and his voice almost cracked,\n\"do you realize what you are saying? If Harry Potter and Voldemort\nfight their war with Muggle weapons there will be nothing left of\nthe world but fire!\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" said Minerva. She had heard of guns, of\ncourse, but they weren't that dangerous to an experienced\nwitch -",
      "Severus spoke as though she weren't in the room. \"Then perhaps,\nHeadmaster, he is sending a deliberate warning to Harry Potter of\nexactly that; saying that any attack with Muggle weapons will be\nmet with retaliation in kind. Command Mr. Potter to cease his use\nof Muggle technology in his battles; that will show him the message\nis received... and not give him any more ideas.\" Severus frowned.\n\"Though, come to think of it, Mr. Malfoy - and of course Miss\nGranger - well, on second thought a blanket prohibition on\ntechnology seems wiser -\"",
      "The old wizard pressed both his hands to his forehead, and from\nhis lips came an unsteady voice, \"I begin to hope that it\nis Harry behind this escape... oh, Merlin defend us all, what have\nI done, what have I done, what will become of the world?\"",
      "Severus shrugged. \"From the rumors I have heard, Headmaster,\nMuggle weapons are only slightly worse than the more...\nrecondite aspects of wizardry -\"",
      "\"Worse?\u202f\" gasped Minerva, and then shut her mouth as\nthough by force.",
      "\"Worse than any peril left in these fading years,\" said Albus.\n\"Not worse than that which erased Atlantis from Time.\"",
      "Minerva stared at him, feeling the sweat break out all along her\nspine.",
      "Severus continued, still addressing Albus. \"All the Death Eaters\nsave Bellatrix would have betrayed him, all his supporters turned\nagainst him, all the powers of the world converged to destroy him,\nif he had been reckless with any truly dangerous potency. Is this\nso different, then?\"",
      "Some motion, some color, had returned to the old wizard's face.\n\"Perhaps not...\"",
      "\"And in any case,\" Severus said with a slightly condescending\nsmile, \"Muggle weapons are not so easy to obtain, not for a\nthousand Galleons or a thousand thousand.\"",
      "Doesn't Harry just Transfigure the devices he uses in his\nbattles? thought Minerva, but before she could open her mouth\nto ask -",
      "The fireplace erupted in green flames, then, and the face of\nPius Thicknesse, Madam Bones's assistant, appeared therein. \"Chief\nWarlock?\" said Thicknesse. \"I have a report for you, transmitted\nfrom -\" Thicknesse's eyes flickered over Minerva and Severus, \"six\nminutes ago.\"",
      "\"Six hours ahead, you mean,\" said Albus. \"These two are meant to\nhear it; deliver your report.\"",
      "\"We know how it was done,\" said Thicknesse. \"In Bellatrix\nBlack's cell, hidden in one corner, was a potions vial; and testing\nthe traces of remaining fluid shows that it was an Animagus\npotion.\"",
      "There was a long pause.",
      "\"I see...\" Albus said heavily.",
      "\"Pardon me?\" said Minerva. She didn't.",
      "Thicknesse's head turned toward her. \"Animagi, Madam McGonagall,\nin their Animagus forms, are of less interest to Dementors. All\nprisoners are tested before their arrival at Azkaban; and if they\nare Animagi, their Animagus form is destroyed. But we had not\nconsidered that someone protected by a Patronus Charm while taking\nthe potion and performing the meditation, might be able to become\nan Animagus after they went to Azkaban -\"",
      "\"I understood,\" Severus said, having by now put on his customary\nsneer, \"that the Animagus meditation required considerable\ntime.\"",
      "\"Well, Mr. Snape,\" Thicknesse barked, \"records show that\nBellatrix Black was an Animagus before she was sentenced\nto Azkaban and her form destroyed; so maybe her second\nmeditation didn't take as much time as her first!\"",
      "\"I would not have thought it possible for any prisoner of\nAzkaban to do such a thing...\" Albus said. \"But Bellatrix Black was\na most powerful sorceress before her incarceration, and she might\nhave done it if any witch could. Can Azkaban be secured against\nthis method?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" said the confident head of Pius Thicknesse. \"Our expert\nsays that it is nigh-unimaginable that an Animagus meditation could\nbe performed in less than three hours, regardless of experience.\nAll visits to prisoners allowed to receive them will be limited to\ntwo hours henceforth, and the Dementors will inform us if any\nPatronus Charm is maintained in the prison areas for longer than\nthat.\"",
      "Albus looked unhappy at that, but nodded. \"I see. There will be\nno further attempts of that sort, of course, but do not relax your\nvigilance. And when Amelia has been told all this, tell her that I\nhave information for her.\"",
      "The head of Pius Thicknesse vanished without another word.",
      "\"No further attempts...?\" said Minerva.",
      "\"Because, dear Minerva,\" Severus drawled, having not quite taken\noff his habitual sneer, \"if the Dark Lord had planned to free any\nof his other servants from Azkaban, he would not have left behind\nthe vial of potion to tell us how it was done.\" Severus frowned. \"I\nconfess... even so I do not see why that vial was left there.\"",
      "\"It is some kind of message...\" Albus said slowly. \"And I cannot\nsee what it means, not at all...\" He drummed his fingers on his\ndesk.",
      "For a long minute or three, the old wizard stared off into\nnothingness, frowning; while Severus also sat in silence.",
      "Then Albus shook his head in dismay, and said, \"Severus, do\nyou comprehend this?\"",
      "\"No,\" said the Potions Master, and with a sardonic smile, \"which\nis probably all the better for us; whatever we are\nintended to conclude from it, that part of his plan has\nmisfired.\"",
      "\"You are certain, now, that it is You-Know... that it\nis Voldemort?\" said Minerva. \"It could not be that some other Death\nEater conceived this clever notion?\"",
      "\"And they knew about rockets, too?\" Severus said dryly. \"I don't\nbelieve the other Death Eaters were so fond of Muggle Studies. It\nis he.\"",
      "\"Aye, it is he,\" Albus said. \"Azkaban has endured impenetrable\nfor ages, only to fall to an ordinary Animagus potion. It is too\nclever and too impossible, which was ever Voldemort's signature\nsince the days he was known as Tom Riddle. Anyone who wished to\nforge that signature must needs be as cunning as Voldemort himself\nto do so. And there is no one else in the world who would\naccidentally overestimate my wit, and leave me a message I cannot\nunderstand at all.\"",
      "\"Unless he has gauged you exactly,\" Severus said tonelessly, \"in\nwhich case all that is just what he intended you to think.\"",
      "Albus sighed. \"Indeed. But even if he has tricked me perfectly,\nwe may at least rely on the conclusion that it was not Harry\nPotter.\"",
      "It should have come as a relief, and yet Minerva felt the chill\nspreading through her spine and her veins, her lungs and her\nbones.",
      "She remembered conversations like this.",
      "She remembered conversations like this from ten years ago, from\na time when blood had run through Britain in wide rivers, when\nwizards and witches she had once taught in class had been\nslaughtered by the hundreds, she remembered burning homes and\nscreaming children and flashes of green light -",
      "\"What will you tell Madam Bones?\" she whispered.",
      "Albus stood from his desk and paced to the center of the room,\nhis hand lightly touching the devices, here an instrument of light,\nthere an instrument of sound; he adjusted his glasses with one\nhand, used the other to center the long silver beard against his\nrobes, and then finally that ancient wizard turned back and faced\nthem.",
      "\"I will tell her what little I know of the Dark Art called\nhorcrux, by which a soul is deprived of death,\" said Albus\nDumbledore, in a soft voice that seemed to fill the whole room,\n\"and I will tell her what may be done with the flesh of the\nservant.\"",
      "\"I will tell her that I am reconstituting the Order of the\nPhoenix.\"",
      "\"I will tell her that Voldemort has returned.\"",
      "\"And that the Second Wizarding War is begun.\"",
      "Some hours later...",
      "The antique old clock upon the wall of the Deputy Headmistress's\noffice had golden hands, and silver numerals to make the\nclock-face; it ticked and jerked soundlessly through its motions,\nfor there was a Quieting enchantment on it.",
      "The golden hour hand approached the silver numeral of nine, the\ngolden minute hand did the same, the two linked components of Time\nnearing each other, soon to be in the same place and never to\ncollide.",
      "It was 8:43 PM, and the time approached when Harry's Time-Turner\nwould open, to be tested in the one way that no imaginable spell\ncould fool, unless that spell could bypass the laws of Time itself.\nNo body or soul, no knowledge or substance, could stretch an extra\nseven hours in a single day. She would make up a message on the\nspot, and tell Harry to take that message back six hours to\nProfessor Flitwick at 3PM, and she would ask Professor Flitwick if\nhe had received it in that hour.",
      "And Professor Flitwick would tell her that he had indeed\nreceived it at 3PM.",
      "And she would tell Severus and Albus to have a little\nmore faith in Harry next time.",
      "Professor McGonagall cast the Patronus Charm, and told her\nshining cat, \"Go to Mr. Potter, and tell him this: Mr. Potter,\nplease come to my office as soon as you hear this, without doing\nanything else along the way.\""

      "Minerva gazed up at the clock, the golden hands and silver\nnumerals, the jerking motion. Muggles had invented that, and until\nthey had, wizards had not bothered keeping time. Bells, timed by a\nsanded hourglass, had served Hogwarts for its classes when it was\nbuilt. It was one of the things that blood purists wished not to be\ntrue, and therefore Minerva knew it.",
      "She had received an Outstanding on her Muggle Studies N.E.W.T.,\nwhich now seemed to her a mark of shame, considering how little she\nknew. Her younger self had realized, even then, that the class was\na sham, taught by a pureblood, supposedly because Muggleborns could\nnot appreciate what wizardborns needed to be told, and actually\nbecause the Board of Governors did not approve of Muggles at all.\nBut when she was seventeen the Outstanding grade had been the main\nthing that mattered to her, she was saddened to remember...",
      "If Harry Potter and Voldemort fight their war with Muggle\nweapons there will be nothing left of the world but fire!",
      "She couldn't imagine it, and the reason she couldn't imagine it\nwas that she couldn't imagine Harry fighting You-Know-Who.",
      "She had encountered the Dark Lord four times and survived each\none, three times with Albus to shield her and once with Moody at\nher side. She remembered the damaged, snakelike face, the faint\ngreen scales scattered over the skin, the glowing red eyes, the\nvoice that laughed in a high-pitched hiss and promised nothing but\ncruelty and torment: the monster pure and complete.",
      "And Harry Potter was easy to picture in her mind, the bright\nexpression on the face of a young boy who wavered between taking\nthe ludicrous seriously and taking the serious ludicrously.",
      "And to think of the two of them facing off at wandpoint was too\npainful to be imagined.",
      "They had no right, no right at all to set this on an\neleven-year-old boy. She knew what the Headmaster had decided for\nhim this day, for she had been told to make the arrangements; and\nif it had been her at the same age she would have raged and\nscreamed and cried and been inconsolable for weeks, and...",
      "He is no ordinary first-year, Albus had said. He is\nmarked as the Dark Lord's equal, and he has power the Dark Lord\nknows not.",
      "The terrible hollow voice booming from Sybill Trelawney's\nthroat, the true and original prophecy, echoed once more through\nher mind. She had a feeling it didn't mean what the Headmaster\nthought it did, but there was no way to put the difference into\nwords.",
      "And even so it still seemed true, that if there were any\neleven-year-old within the Earth entire who could bear this burden,\nthat boy approached her office now. And if she said anything at all\nlike 'poor Harry' to his face... well, he wouldn't like it.",
      "So now I've got to find some way to kill an immortal Dark\nWizard, Harry had said on the day he had first learned. I\nreally wish you had told me that before I started\nshopping...",
      "She'd been Head of House Gryffindor for long enough, she'd\nwatched enough friends die, to know that there were some people you\ncouldn't save from becoming heroes.",
      "There came a knock at the door, and Professor McGonagall said,\n\"Enter.\"",
      "When Harry entered, his face had the same cold, alert look she'd\nseen in Mary's Place; and she wondered for an instant if he'd been\nwearing that same mask, that same self, this whole day.",
      "The young boy seated himself on the chair before her desk, and\nsaid, \"So is it time for me to be told what's going on?\" Neutral\nthe words, not the sharpness that should have gone with the\nexpression.",
      "Professor McGonagall's eyes rose in surprise before she could\nstop them, and she said, \"The Headmaster told you nothing, Mr.\nPotter?\"",
      "The boy shook his head. \"Only that he'd received a warning that\nI might be in danger, but I was safe now.\"",
      "Minerva was having trouble meeting his gaze. How could they\ndo this to him, how could they lay this upon an\neleven-year-old boy, this war, this destiny, this prophecy... and\nthey didn't even trust him...",
      "She forced herself to look at Harry directly, and saw that his\ngreen eyes were calm as they rested on her.",
      "\"Professor McGonagall?\" the boy said quietly.",
      "\"Mr. Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall, \"I'm afraid it is not\nmy place to explain, but if after this the Headmaster\nstill does not tell you anything, you may come back to me\nand I will go yell at him for you.\"",
      "The boy's eyes widened, something of the real Harry showing\nthrough the crack before the cool mask was set back in place.",
      "\"In any case,\" Professor McGonagall said briskly. \"I'm sorry for\nthe inconvenience, Mr. Potter, but I need to ask you to use your\nTime-Turner to go back six hours to three o'clock, and give the\nfollowing message to Professor Flitwick: Silver on the tree. Ask\nthe Professor to note down the time at which you gave him that\nmessage. Afterward the Headmaster wishes to meet with you at your\nconvenience.\"",
      "There was a pause.",
      "Then the boy said, \"I am suspected of misusing my Time-Turner,\nthen?\"",
      "\"Not by me!\u202f\" Professor McGonagall said hastily. \"I\nam sorry for the inconvenience, Mr. Potter.\"",
      "There was another pause, and then the young boy shrugged. \"It'll\nplay hob with my sleep schedule but I suppose it can't be helped.\nPlease let the house elves know that if I ask for an early\nbreakfast at, say, three A.M. tomorrow morning, I'm to receive\nit.\"",
      "\"Of course, Mr. Potter,\" she said. \"Thank you for\nunderstanding.\"",
      "The boy rose up from his chair and gave her a formal nod, then\nslipped out the door with his hand already going under his shirt to\nwhere his Time-Turner waited; and she almost called out\nHarry! only she wouldn't have known what to say after.",
      "Instead she waited, her eyes on the clock.",
      "How long did she need to wait for Harry Potter to go back in\ntime?",
      "She didn't need to wait at all, actually; if he had done it,\nthen it had already happened...",
      "Minerva knew, then, that she was delaying because she was\nnervous, and the realization saddened her. Mischief, yes,\nunspeakable unthinkable mischief with all the prudence and\nforesight of a falling rock - she didn't know how the boy had\ntricked the Hat into not Sorting him to Gryffindor where he\nobviously belonged - but nothing dark or harmful, not ever. Beneath\nthat mischief his goodness ran as deep and as true as the Weasley\ntwins', though not even the Cruciatus Curse could have gotten her\nto say that out loud.",
      "\"Expecto Patronum,\" she said, and then, \"Go to\nProfessor Flitwick, and bear back his reply after you ask him this:\n'Did Mr. Potter give you a message from me, what was that message,\nand when did you receive it?'\"",
      "One hour earlier, having used the last remaining spin of his\nTime-Turner after putting on the Cloak of Invisibility, Harry\ntucked the hourglass back into his shirt.",
      "And he set out toward the Slytherin dungeons, striding as\nquickly as his invisible legs could manage, though not running.\nThankfully the Deputy Headmistress's office was already on a lower\nfloor of Hogwarts...",
      "A few staircases later, taken two steps but not three steps at\nonce, Harry stopped at a corridor around whose final bend lay the\nentrance to the Slytherin dorms.",
      "Harry took a piece of parchment (not paper) out of his parch,\ntook a Quotes Quill (not pen) out of his pouch, and told the quill,\n\"Write these letters exactly as I say them: Z-P-G-B-S-Y, space,\nF-V-Y-I-R-E-B-A-G-U-R-G-E-R-R.\"",
      "There were two kinds of codes in cryptography, codes that\nstopped your little brother from reading your message and codes\nthat stopped major governments from reading your message, and this\nwas the first kind of code, but it was better than nothing. In\ntheory, no one should read it anyway; but even if they did, they\nwouldn't remember anything interesting unless they did cryptography\nfirst.",
      "Harry then put that parchment in a parchment envelope, and with\nhis wand melted a little green wax to seal it.",
      "In principle, of course, Harry could've done all that hours\nearlier, but somehow waiting until after he heard the\nmessage from Professor McGonagall's own lips seemed less like\nMessing With Time.",
      "Harry then put that envelope inside another envelope, which\nalready contained another sheet of paper with other instructions,\nand five silver Sickles.",
      "He closed that envelope (which already had a name written on the\noutside), sealed it with more green wax, and pressed a final Sickle\ninto that seal.",
      "Then Harry put that envelope into the very last\nenvelope on which was written in large letters the name \"Merry\nTavington\".",
      "And Harry peeked around the bend to where the scowling portrait\nthat served as the door to the Slytherin dorms waited; and as he\ndid not wish the portrait to recall not-seeing anyone invisible,\nHarry used the Hover Charm to float the envelope to the scowling\nman, and tap it against him.",
      "The scowling man looked down at the envelope, peering at it\nthrough a monocle, and sighed, and turned around to face toward the\ninside of the Slytherin dorms, and called, \"Message for Merry\nTavington!\"",
      "The envelope was then allowed to fall to the floor.",
      "A few moments later the portrait door opened, and Merry snatched\nup the envelope from the floor.",
      "She would open it up and find a Sickle and an envelope addressed\nto a fourth-year student named Margaret Bulstrode.",
      "(Slytherins did this sort of thing all the time, and a Sickle\ndefinitely constituted a rush order.)",
      "Margaret would open her envelope, and find five Sickles\nalong with an envelope to be dropped off in an unused\nclassroom...",
      "...after she used her Time-Turner to go back five\nhours...",
      "...whereupon she would find another five Sickles waiting for\nher, if she got there quickly.",
      "And an invisible Harry Potter would be waiting in that classroom\nfrom three PM to three-thirty, just in case someone tried the\nobvious test.",
      "Well, it had been obvious to Professor Quirrell, anyway.",
      "It had also been obvious to Professor Quirrell that (a) Margaret\nBulstrode had a Time-Turner and (b) she wasn't very strict about\nhow she used it, e.g. telling her younger sister really good pieces\nof gossip \"before\" anyone else had heard.",
      "Some of the tension leaked off Harry as he strode away from the\nportrait door, still invisible. Somehow his mind had still managed\nto worry about the plan, even knowing that it had already\nsucceeded. Now there remained only the confrontation with\nDumbledore, and then he was done for the day... he'd go to the\nHeadmaster's gargoyles at 9PM, since doing it at 8PM would seem\nmore suspicious. This way he could claim that he'd just\nmisunderstood what Professor McGonagall had meant by\n\"afterward\"...",
      "The obscure pain clutched at Harry's heart again as he thought\nof Professor McGonagall.",
      "So Harry retreated a little further into his dark side, which\nhad worn the calm expression and kept the fatigue off his face, and\nkept walking.",
      "There would come a reckoning, but sometimes you had to borrow\neverything you could today, and let the payments come due\ntomorrow.",
      "Even Harry's dark side was feeling the exhaustion by the time\nthe spiraling staircase had delivered him to the great oaken door\nthat was the final gate to Dumbledore's office; but since Harry was\nnow legally four hours past his natural bedtime, it was\nsafe to let some of the fatigue show, the physical if not the\nemotional.",
      "The oaken door swung open -",
      "Harry's eyes had already been focused in the direction of the\ngreat desk, the throne behind it; so it took a moment to register\nthat the throne was empty, the desk barren but for a single\nleatherbound volume; and then Harry shifted his gaze to see the\nwizard standing among his fiddly things, the mysterious unknown\ndevices in their scores. Fawkes and the Sorting Hat occupied their\nrespective perches, a bright cheerful blaze crackled in a nook that\nHarry had not before realized was a fireplace, and there were the\ntwo umbrellas and three red slippers for left feet. All things in\ntheir place and in their customary appearance except the old wizard\nhimself, standing tall and dressed in robes of the most formal\nblack. It came as a shock to the eyes, those robes on that person,\nit was as if Harry had seen his father wearing a business suit.",
      "Very ancient was the appearance of Albus Dumbledore, and\nsorrowful.",
      "\"Hello, Harry,\" said the old wizard.",
      "From within an alternate self maintained like an Occlumency\nconstruct, an innocent-Harry who had absolutely no idea what was\nhappening inclined his head coldly, and said, \"Headmaster. I expect\nyou've heard back from Deputy Headmistress McGonagall by now, so if\nit's fine by you, I would really like to know what is\ngoing on.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" said the old wizard, \"it is time, Harry Potter.\" The back\nstraightened, only slightly for the wizard had already been\nstanding straight; but somehow even that small change made the\nwizard seem a foot taller, and stronger if not younger, formidable\nthough not dangerous, his potency gathered about him like a cowl.\nIn a clear voice, then, he spoke: \"This day your war against\nVoldemort has begun.\"",
      "\"What?\" said the outer Harry who knew nothing, while something\nwatching from inside thought much the same only with a lot more\nprofanity attached.",
      "\"Bellatrix Black has been taken from Azkaban, she has escaped\nfrom a prison inescapable,\" the old wizard said. \"It is a feat that\nbears Voldemort's signature if ever I have seen it; and she, his\nmost faithful servant, is one of three requisites he must obtain to\nrise again in a new body. After ten years the enemy you once\ndefeated has returned, as was foretold.\"",
      "Neither part of Harry could think of anything to say to that, at\nleast not for the few seconds before the old wizard continued.",
      "\"It need change little for you, for now,\" said the old wizard.\n\"I have begun reconstituting the Order of the Phoenix that will\nserve you, I have alerted the few souls who can and should\nunderstand: Amelia Bones, Alastor Moody, Bartemius Crouch, certain\nothers. Of the prophecy - yes, there is a prophecy - I have not\ntold them, but they know that Voldemort is returned, and they know\nthat you are to play some vital role. They and I shall fight your\nwar in its lesser beginnings, while you grow stronger, and perhaps\nwiser, here at Hogwarts.\" The old wizard's hand came up, as though\nbeseeching. \"So to you, for now, there is but one change, and I\nimplore you to understand its necessity. Do you recognize the book\non my desk, Harry?\"",
      "The inner part of Harry was screaming and banging its head\nagainst imaginary walls, while the outer Harry turned and stared at\nwhat proved to be -",
      "There was a rather long pause.",
      "Then Harry said, \"It is a copy of The Lord of the Rings\nby J. R. R. Tolkien.\"",
      "\"You recognized a quote from that book,\" said Dumbledore, an\nintent look in his eyes, \"so I assume you remember it well. If I am\nmistaken, let me be corrected.\"",
      "Harry just stared at him.",
      "\"It is important to understand,\" said Dumbledore, \"that this\nbook is not a realistic depiction of a wizarding war. John Tolkien\nnever fought Voldemort. Your war will not be like the books you\nhave read. Real life is not like stories. Do you understand,\nHarry?\"",
      "Harry, rather slowly, nodded yes; and then shook his head\nno.",
      "\"In particular,\" said Dumbledore, \"there is a certain very\nfoolish thing that Gandalf does in the first book. He makes many\nmistakes, does Tolkien's wizard; but this one error is the most\nunforgivable. That mistake is this: When Gandalf first suspected,\neven for a moment, that Frodo held the One Ring, he should have\nmoved Frodo to Rivendell at once. He might have been\nembarrassed, that old wizard, if his suspicions had proven false.\nHe might have found it awkward to so command Frodo, and Frodo would\nhave been greatly inconvenienced, needing to set aside many other\nplans and pastimes. But a little embarrassment, and awkwardness,\nand inconvenience, is as nothing compared to the loss of your whole\nwar, when the nine Nazgul swoop down on the Shire while you are\nreading old scrolls in Minas Tirith, and take the Ring at once. And\nit is not Frodo alone who would have been hurt; all Middle-Earth\nwould have fallen into slavery. If it had not been only a\nstory, Harry, they would have lost their war. Do you understand\nwhat I am saying?\"",
      "\"Er...\" said Harry, \"not exactly...\" There was something about\nDumbledore when he was like this, which made it hard to stay\nproperly cold; his dark side had trouble with weird.",
      "\"Then I will spell it out,\" said the old wizard. His voice was\nstern, his eyes were sad. \"Frodo should have been moved to\nRivendell at once by Gandalf himself - and Frodo should never have\nleft Rivendell without guard. There should have been no night of\nterror in Bree, no Barrow-downs, no Weathertop where Frodo was\nwounded, they could have lost their entire war any of those times,\nfor Gandalf's folly! Do you understand now what I am saying to you,\nson of Michael and Petunia?\"",
      "And the Harry who knew nothing did understand.",
      "And the Harry who knew nothing saw that it was the smart, the\nwise, the intelligent and sane, the right thing to do.",
      "And the Harry who knew nothing said just what an innocent Harry\nwould have said, while the silent watcher screamed in\nconfusion and agony.",
      "\"You're saying,\" Harry said, his voice shaking as the emotions\ninside burned through the outer calm, \"that I'm not going home to\nmy parents for Easter.\"",
      "\"You will see them again,\" the old wizard said swiftly.\n\"I will beg them to come here to be with you, I will extend them\nevery courtesy during their visits. But you are not going home for\nEaster, Harry. You are not going home for the summer. You are no\nlonger taking lunches in Diagon Alley, even with Professor Quirrell\nto watch you. Your blood is the second requisite Voldemort needs to\nrise as strong as before. So you are never again leaving the bounds\nof Hogwarts's wards without a vital reason, and a guard strong\nenough to fend off any attack for long enough to get you to safety.\n\"",
      "Water was beginning at the corners of Harry's eyes. \"Is that a\nrequest?\" said his quavering voice. \"Or an order?\"",
      "\"I'm sorry, Harry,\" the old wizard said softly. \"Your parents\nwill see the necessity, I hope; but if not... I am afraid they have\nno recourse; the law, however wrongly, does not recognize them as\nyour guardians. I am sorry, Harry, and I will understand if you\ndespise me for it, but it must be done.\"",
      "Harry whirled, looked at the door, he couldn't look at\nDumbledore any more, couldn't trust his own face.",
      "This is the cost to yourself, said Hufflepuff within\nhis mind, even as you imposed costs on others. Will that change\nyour whole view of the matter, the way Professor Quirrell thinks it\nwill?",
      "Automatically, the mask of the innocent Harry said exactly what\nit would have said: \"Are my parents in danger? Do they\nneed to be moved here?\"",
      "\"No,\" said the old wizard's voice. \"I do not think so. The Death\nEaters learned, toward the end of the war, not to attack the\nOrder's families. And if Voldemort is now acting without his former\ncompanions, he still knows that it is I who make the decisions for\nnow, and he knows that I would give him nothing for any threat to\nyour family. I have taught him that I do not give in to blackmail,\nand so he will not try.\"",
      "Harry turned back then, and saw a coldness on the old wizard's\nface to match the shift in his voice, Dumbledore's blue eyes grown\nhard as steel behind the glasses, it didn't match the person but it\nmatched the formal black robes.",
      "\"Is that everything, then?\" said Harry's trembling voice. Later\nhe would think about this, later he would think of some cunning\ncountermeasure, later he would ask Professor Quirrell if there was\nany way to convince the Headmaster he was mistaken. Right now,\nmaintaining the mask was taking all of Harry's attention.",
      "\"Voldemort used a Muggle artifact to escape Azkaban,\" the old\nwizard said. \"He is watching you and learning from you, Harry\nPotter. Soon a man named Arthur Weasley at the Ministry will issue\nan edict that all use of Muggle artifacts must cease in the Defense\nProfessor's battles. In the future, when you have a good idea, keep\nit closer about yourself.\"",
      "It didn't seem important by comparison. Harry just nodded, and\nsaid again, \"Is that everything?\"",
      "There was a pause.",
      "\"Please,\" said the old wizard in a whisper. \"I have no right to\nask your forgiveness, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, but please,\nat least say that you understand why.\" There was water in the old\nwizard's eyes.",
      "\"I understand,\" said the voice of the outer Harry who did\nunderstand, \"I mean... I was sort of thinking about it anyway...\nwondering whether I could get you and my parents to let me stay\nover at Hogwarts during the summer like the orphans, so I could\nread the library here, it's just more interesting at Hogwarts\nanyway...\"",
      "A choking sound came from Albus Dumbledore's throat.",
      "Harry turned again toward the door. It wasn't escape unscathed,\nbut it was escape.",
      "He took a step forward.",
      "His hand reached to the door-handle.",
      "A piercing cry split the air -",
      "As though in slow motion, as Harry spun, he saw the phoenix\nalready launched through the air and winging toward him.",
      "From the true Harry, the one who knew his own guilt, came a\nflash of panic, he hadn't thought of that, hadn't anticipated it,\nhe'd prepared to face Dumbledore but he'd forgotten about\nFawkes -",
      "Flap, flap, and flap, three times the phoenix's wings flapped\nlike the flaring up and dying down of a fire, duration seemed to\npass too slowly as Fawkes soared over the mysterious devices toward\nwhere Harry stood.",
      "And the red-golden bird was hovering in front of him with gentle\nwing-sweeps, bobbing in the air like a candle-flame.",
      "\"What is it, Fawkes?\" said the false Harry in puzzlement,\nlooking the phoenix in the eyes, as he would if he were innocent.\nThe real Harry, feeling the same awful sickness inside as when\nProfessor McGonagall had expressed her trust in him, thought,\nDid I turn evil today, Fawkes? I didn't think I was evil... Do\nyou hate me now? If I've become something a phoenix hates, maybe I\nshould just give it up now, give up everything now and confess\n-",
      "Fawkes screamed, the most terrible cry Harry had ever heard, a\nscream that set all the devices vibrating and made all the sleeping\nfigures start within their portraits.",
      "It pierced through all of Harry's defenses like a white-hot\nsword through butter, collapsed all his layers like a punctured\nballoon popping, reshuffled his priorities in an instant as he\nremembered the one most important thing; the tears began pouring\nfreely from Harry's eyes, down his cheeks, his voice choked as the\nwords came out of his throat like coughing up lava -",
      "\"Fawkes says,\" Harry's voice said, \"he wants me, to do,\nsomething, about, the prisoners, in Azkaban -\"",
      "\"Fawkes, no!\u202f\" said the old wizard. Dumbledore strode\nforward, reaching out to the phoenix with a pleading hand. The old\nwizard's voice was almost as desperate as the phoenix's scream had\nbeen. \"You cannot ask that of him, Fawkes, he's only a boy\nstill!\"",
      "\"You went to Azkaban,\" Harry whispered, \"you took Fawkes with\nyou, he saw - you saw - you were there, you saw -\nWHY DIDN'T YOU DO ANYTHING? WHY DIDN'T YOU LET THEM\nOUT?\u202f\"",
      "When the instruments stopped vibrating, Harry realized that\nFawkes had screamed at the same time as his own scream, that the\nphoenix was now flying next to Harry and facing Dumbledore at his\nside, the red-golden head level with his own.",
      "\"Can you,\" whispered the old wizard, \"can you truly hear the\nvoice of the phoenix so clearly?\"",
      "Harry was sobbing almost too hard to speak, for all the metal\ndoors he'd passed, the voices he'd heard, the worst memories, the\ndesperate begging as he walked away, all of it had burst into his\nmind like fire at the phoenix's scream, all the inner bulwarks\nsmashed. Harry didn't know whether he could truly hear the voice of\nthe phoenix so clearly, whether he would have understood Fawkes\nwithout already knowing. All Harry knew was that he had a plausible\nexcuse to say the things Professor Quirrell had told him he must\nnever raise in conversation from this day forth; because\nthis was just what an innocent Harry would have said, would have\ndone, if he had heard so clearly. \"They're hurting - we\nhave to help them -\"",
      "\"I can't!\u202f\" cried Albus Dumbledore. \"Harry, Fawkes, I\ncan't, there's nothing I can do!\"",
      "Another piercing scream.",
      "\"WHY NOT? JUST GO IN AND TAKE THEM OUT!\"",
      "The old wizard wrenched his gaze from the phoenix, his eyes\nmeeting Harry's instead. \"Harry, tell Fawkes for me! Tell him it's\nnot that simple! Phoenixes aren't mere animals but they\nare animals, Harry, they can't understand -\"",
      "\"I don't understand either,\" Harry said, his voice trembling. \"I\ndon't understand why you're feeding people to Dementors!\nAzkaban isn't a prison, it's a torture chamber and you're torturing\nthose people to DEATH!\u202f\"",
      "\"Percival,\" said the old wizard hoarsely, \"Percival Dumbledore,\nmy own father, Harry, my own father died in Azkaban! I know, I know\nit is a horror! But what would you have of me? To break\nAzkaban by force? Would you have me declare open rebellion against\nthe Ministry?\"",
      "CAW!",
      "There was a pause, and Harry's trembling voice said, \"Fawkes\ndoesn't know anything about governments, he just wants you - to\ntake the prisoners out - of their cells - and he'll help you fight,\nif anyone stands in your way - and - and so will I, Headmaster!\nI'll go with you and destroy any Dementor that comes near! We'll\nworry about the political fallout afterward, I bet that you and I\ntogether could get away with it -\"",
      "\"Harry,\" whispered the old wizard, \"phoenixes do not understand\nhow winning a battle can lose a war.\" Tears were streaming down the\nold wizard's cheeks, dripping into his silver beard. \"The battle is\nall they know. They are good, but not wise. That is why they choose\nwizards to be their masters.\"",
      "\"Can you bring out the Dementors to where I can get at them?\"\nHarry's voice was begging, now. \"Bring them out in groups of\nfifteen - I think I could destroy that many at a time without\nhurting myself -\"",
      "The old wizard shook his head. \"It was hard enough to pass off\nthe loss of one - they might give me one more, but never two - they\nare considered national possessions, Harry, weapons in case of war\n-\"",
      "Fury blazed in Harry then, blazed up like fire, it might have\ncome from where a phoenix now rested on his own shoulder, and it\nmight have come from his own dark side, and the two angers mixed\nwithin him, the cold and the hot, and it was a strange voice that\nsaid from his throat, \"Tell me something. What does a government\nhave to do, what do the voters have to do with their democracy,\nwhat do the people of a country have to do,\nbefore I ought to decide that I'm not on their side any more?\"",
      "The old wizard's eyes widened where he stared at the boy with a\nphoenix upon his shoulder. \"Harry... are those your words, or the\nDefense Professor's -\"",
      "\"Because there has to be some point, doesn't there? And\nif it's not Azkaban, where is it, then?\"",
      "\"Harry, listen, please, hear me! Wizards could not live together\nif they each declared rebellion against the whole, every time they\ndiffered! Always there will be something -\"",
      "\"Azkaban is not just something! It's evil!\u202f\"",
      "\"Yes, even evil! Even some evils, Harry, for wizards are not\nperfectly good! And yet it is better that we live in peace, than in\nchaos; and for you and I to break Azkaban by force would be the\nbeginning of chaos, can you not see it?\" The old wizard's\nvoice was pleading. \"And it is possible to oppose the will of your\nfellows openly or in secret, without hating them, without\ndeclaring them evil and enemy! I do not think the people of this\ncountry deserve that of you, Harry! And even if some of them did -\nwhat of the children, what of the students in Hogwarts, what of the\nmany good people mixed in with the bad?\"",
      "Harry looked on his shoulder at where Fawkes had perched, saw\nthe phoenix's eyes gazing back at him, they did not glow and yet\nthey blazed, red flames in a sea of golden fire.",
      "What do you think, Fawkes?",
      "\"Caw?\" said the phoenix.",
      "Fawkes didn't understand the conversation.",
      "The young boy looked at the old wizard, and said in a thick\nvoice, \"Or maybe the phoenixes are wiser than us, smarter than us,\nmaybe they follow us around hoping that someday we'll\nlisten to them, someday we'll get it, someday\nwe'll just take, the prisoners, out, of their\ncells -\"",
      "Harry spun and pulled open the oaken door and stepped onto the\nstaircase and slammed the door behind him.",
      "The stairwell began rotating, Harry began descending, and he put\nhis face in his hands, and began to weep.",
      "It wasn't until he was halfway to the bottom that he noticed the\ndifference, noticed the warmth still spreading through him, and\nrealized that -",
      "\"Fawkes?\" Harry whispered.",
      "- the phoenix was still on his shoulder, perched there as he had\nseen him a few times upon Dumbledore's.",
      "Harry looked again into the eyes, red flames in golden fire.",
      "\"You're not my phoenix now... are you?\"",
      "Caw!",
      "\"Oh,\" Harry said, his voice trembling a little, \"I'm glad to\nhear that, Fawkes, because I don't think - the Headmaster - I don't\nthink he deserves -\"",
      "Harry stopped, took a breath.",
      "\"I don't think he deserves that, Fawkes, he was trying to do the\nright thing...\"",
      "Caw!",
      "\"But you're angry at him and trying to make a point. I\nunderstand.\"",
      "The phoenix nestled his head against Harry's shoulder, and the\nstone gargoyle walked smoothly aside to let Harry pass back into\nthe corridors of Hogwarts."

      "Aftermath, Hermione Granger:",
      "She was just starting to close up her books and put away her\nhomework in preparation for sleep, Padma and Mandy stacking up\ntheir own books across the table from her, when Harry Potter walked\ninto the Ravenclaw common room; and it was only then that she\nrealized, she hadn't seen him at all since breakfast.",
      "That realization was rapidly stomped-on by a much more startling\none.",
      "There was a golden-red winged creature on Harry's shoulder, a\nbright bird of fire.",
      "And Harry looked sad and worn and really tired like the\nphoenix was the only thing keeping him on his feet, but there was\nstill a warmth about him, if you crossed your eyes you might have\nthought you were looking at the Headmaster somehow, that was the\nimpression that went through Hermione's mind even though it didn't\nmake any sense.",
      "Harry Potter trudged across the Ravenclaw common room, past\nsofas full of staring girls, past cardgame-circles of staring boys,\nheading for her.",
      "In theory she wasn't talking to Harry Potter yet, his week\nwasn't up until tomorrow, but whatever was going on was clearly a\nwhole lot more important than that -",
      "\"Fawkes,\" Harry said, just as she was opening her mouth, \"that\ngirl over there is Hermione Granger, she's not talking to me right\nnow because I'm an idiot, but if you want to be on a good person's\nshoulder she's better than me.\"",
      "So much exhaustion and hurt in Harry Potter's voice -",
      "But before she could figure out what to do about it, the phoenix\nhad glided off Harry's shoulder like a fire creeping up a\nmatchstick on fast-forward, flashing toward her; there was a\nphoenix flying in front of her and staring at her with eyes of\nlight and flame.",
      "\"Caw?\u202f\" asked the phoenix.",
      "Hermione stared at it, feeling like she was facing a question on\na test she'd forgotten to study for, the one most important\nquestion and she'd gone her whole life without studying for it, she\ncouldn't find anything to say.",
      "\"I'm -\" she said. \"I'm only twelve, I haven't done\nanything yet -\"",
      "The phoenix just glided gently around, rotating around one\nwingtip like the being of light and air that it was, and soared\nback to Harry Potter's shoulder, where it settled down quite\nfirmly.",
      "\"You silly boy,\" said Padma across from her, looking like she\nwas deciding whether to laugh or grimace, \"phoenixes aren't for\nsmart girls who do their homework, they're for idiots who charge\nstraight at five older Slytherin bullies. There's a reason why the\nGryffindor colors are red and gold, you know.\"",
      "There was a lot of friendly laughter in the Ravenclaw common\nroom.",
      "Hermione wasn't one of the laughing ones.",
      "Neither was Harry.",
      "Harry had put a hand over his face. \"Tell Hermione I'm sorry,\"\nhe said to Padma, his voice almost fallen to a whisper. \"Tell her I\nforgot that phoenixes are animals, they don't understand time and\nplanning, they don't understand people who are going to do\ngood things later - I'm not sure they understand really the notion\nof there being something that a person is, all they see is\nwhat people do. Fawkes doesn't know what twelve means. Tell\nHermione I'm sorry - I shouldn't have - it just all goes wrong,\ndoesn't it?\"",
      "Harry turned to go, the phoenix still on his shoulder, began\nslowly trudging toward the staircase that led up to his dorm.",
      "And Hermione couldn't leave it at that, she just\ncouldn't leave it at that. She didn't know if it was her\ncompetition with Harry or something else. She just couldn't leave\nit with the phoenix turning away from her.",
      "She had to -",
      "Her mind keyed a frantic question to the entirety of her\nexcellent memory, found just one thing -",
      "\"I was going to run in front of the Dementor to try and save\nHarry!\" she shouted a little desperately at the red-golden bird. \"I\nmean, I actually did start running and everything! That was stupid\nand courageous, right?\"",
      "With a warbling cry the phoenix launched itself from Harry's\nshoulder again, back toward her like a spreading blaze, it circled\nher three times like she was the center of an inferno, and for just\na moment its wing brushed against her cheek, before the phoenix\nsoared back to Harry.",
      "There was a hush in the Ravenclaw common room.",
      "\"Told you so,\" Harry said aloud, and then he started climbing\nthe stairs up to his bedroom; he seemed to climb very quickly, like\nhe was very light on his feet for some reason, so that in just a\nmoment he and Fawkes were gone.",
      "Hermione held up a trembling hand to her cheek where Fawkes had\nbrushed her with his wing, a spot of warmth lingering there like\nthat one small patch of skin had been very gently set on fire.",
      "She'd answered the question of the phoenix, she supposed, but it\nfelt to her like she'd just barely squeaked by on the test, like\nshe'd gotten a 62 and she could've gotten 104 if she'd tried\nharder.",
      "If she'd tried at all.",
      "She hadn't really been trying, when she thought about\nit.",
      "Just doing her homework -",
      "Who have you saved?",
      "Aftermath, Fawkes:",
      "Nightmares, the boy had expected, screams and begging and\nhowling hurricanes of emptiness, the discharge of the horrors being\nlaid down into memory, and in that fashion, perhaps, becoming part\nof the past.",
      "And the boy knew that the nightmares would come.",
      "The next night, they would come.",
      "The boy dreamed, and in his dreams the world was on fire,\nHogwarts was on fire, his home was on fire, the streets of Oxford\nwere on fire, all ablaze with golden flames that shone but did not\nconsume, and all the people walking through the blazing streets\nwere shining with white light brighter than the fire, like they\nwere flames themselves, or stars.",
      "The other first-year boys came to bed, and saw it for\nthemselves, the wonder whose rumor they had already heard, that in\nhis bed Harry Potter lay silent and motionless, a gentle smile on\nhis face, while perched on his pillow a red-golden bird watched\nover him, with bright wings swept above him like a blanket pulled\nover his head.",
      "The reckoning had been put off one more night.",
      "Aftermath, Draco Malfoy:",
      "Draco straightened his robes, making sure the green trim was\nstraight. He waved his wand over his own head and said a Charm that\nFather had taught him while other children were still playing in\nmud, a Charm which ensured that not a single speck of lint or dust\nwould dirty his wizard's robes.",
      "Draco picked up the mysterious envelope that Father had owled\nhim, and tucked it into his robes. He had already used\nIncendio and Everto on the mysterious note.",
      "And then he headed off to breakfast, to seat himself on exactly\nthe same tick of the clock where the food appeared, if he could\nmanage it, so that it would seem like all others had been waiting\non his appearance to eat. Because when you were the scion of Malfoy\nyou were first in everything, including breakfast, that was\nwhy.",
      "Vincent and Gregory were waiting for him outside the door of his\nprivate room, up even before he was - though not, of course,\ndressed quite as sharply.",
      "The Slytherin common room was deserted, anyone who got up this\nearly was heading straight to breakfast anyway.",
      "The dungeon halls were silent but for their own footsteps, empty\nand echoing.",
      "The Great Hall was a hubbub of alarm despite the relative few\narrivals, some younger children crying, students running back and\nforth between tables or standing in knots shouting at each other, a\nred-robed prefect was standing in front of two green-trimmed\nstudents and yelling at them and Snape was striding toward the mess\n-",
      "The noise dimmed a little as people caught sight of Draco, as\nsome of the faces turned to stare at him, and fell quiet.",
      "The food appeared on the tables. No one looked at it.",
      "And Snape spun on his heel, abandoning his target, and headed\nstraight toward Draco.",
      "A knot of fear clutched at Draco's heart, had something happened\nto Father - no, surely Father would have told him - whatever was\nhappening, why hadn't Father told him -",
      "There were bags of fatigue beneath Snape's eyes, Draco saw as\ntheir Head of House came close, the Potions Master had never been a\nsharp dresser (that was an understatement) but his robes were even\ndirtier and more disarrayed this morning, spotted with extra\ngrease.",
      "\"You haven't heard?\" hissed their Head of House as he came\nclose. \"For pity's sake, Malfoy, don't you have a newspaper\ndelivered?\"",
      "\"What is it, Profe-\"",
      "\"Bellatrix Black was taken from Azkaban!\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" said Draco in shock, as Gregory behind him\nsaid something he really shouldn't have and Vincent just\ngasped.",
      "Snape was gazing at him with narrowed eyes, then nodded\nabruptly. \"Lucius told you nothing, then. I see.\" Snape gave a\nsnort, turned away -",
      "\"Professor!\" said Draco. The implications were just starting to\ndawn on him, his mind spinning frantically. \"Professor, what should\nI do - Father didn't instruct me -\"",
      "\"Then I suggest,\" Snape said sneeringly, as he strode\naway, \"that you tell them that, Malfoy, as your father\nintended!\"",
      "Draco glanced back at Vincent and Gregory, though he didn't know\nwhy he was bothering, of course they looked even more confused than\nhe did.",
      "And Draco walked forward to the Slytherin table, and sat down at\nthe far end, which was still empty of sitters.",
      "Draco put a sausage omelet on his plate, began eating it with\nautomatic motions.",
      "Bellatrix Black had been taken from Azkaban.",
      "Bellatrix Black had been taken from Azkaban...?",
      "Draco didn't know what to make of that, it was as totally\nunexpected as the Sun going out - well, the Sun would expectedly go\nout in six billion years but this was as unexpected as the Sun\ngoing out tomorrow. Father wouldn't have done it,\nDumbledore wouldn't have done it, no one should have been\nable to do it - what did it mean - what\nuse would Bellatrix be to anyone after ten years in\nAzkaban - even if she got strong again, what use was a powerful\nsorceress who was completely evil and insane and fanatically\ndevoted to a Dark Lord who wasn't around anymore?",
      "\"Hey,\" said Vincent from where he was sitting next to Draco, \"I\ndon't understand, boss, why'd we do that?\"",
      "\"We didn't do it, you dolt!\" snapped Draco. \"Oh, for\nMerlin's sake, if even you think we - didn't your father\never tell you any stories about Bellatrix Black? She tortured\nFather once, she tortured your father, she's tortured\neveryone, the Dark Lord once told her to Crucio\nherself and she did it! She didn't do crazy\nthings to inspire fear and obedience in the populace, she did crazy\nthings because she's crazy! She's a bitch is what she\nis!\"",
      "\"Oh, really?\" said an incensed voice from behind Draco.",
      "Draco didn't look up. Gregory and Vincent would be watching his\nback.",
      "\"I would've thought you'd be happy -\"",
      "\"- to hear that a Death Eater had been freed, Malfoy!\"",
      "Amycus Carrow had always been one of the other problem\npeople; Father had once told Draco to make sure he was never alone\nin the same room with Amycus...",
      "Draco turned around and gave Flora and Hestia Carrow his Number\nThree Sneer, the one that said that he was in a Noble and Most\nAncient House and they weren't and yes, that mattered. Draco said\nin their general direction, certainly not deigning to address\nthem in particular, \"There's Death Eaters and then there's\nDeath Eaters,\" and then turned back to his food.",
      "There were two furious huffs in unison, and then two pairs of\nshoes stormed off toward the other end of the Slytherin table.",
      "It was a few minutes later that Millicent Bulstrode ran up to\nthem, visibly out of breath, and said, \"Mr. Malfoy, did you\nhear?\"",
      "\"About Bellatrix Black?\" said Draco. \"Yeah -\"",
      "\"No, about Potter!\"",
      "\"What?\"",
      "\"Potter was going around with a phoenix on his shoulder\nlast night, looking like he'd been dragged through ten leagues of\nmud, they say that the phoenix took him to Azkaban to try to stop\nBellatrix and he fought a duel with her and they blew up half the\nfortress!\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" said Draco. \"Oh, there is just no way\nthat -\"",
      "Draco stopped.",
      "He'd said that a number of times about Harry Potter and had\nstarted to notice a trend.",

      "That was how Alastor Moody had lost his left foot and acquired\nthe Eye of Vance, and how the oppressed souls of Urulat had been\nliberated for a period of around two weeks before another Dark\nWizard moved in on the power vacuum.",

      "Now Mad-Eye Moody was turning slowly, always turning, surveying\nthe graveyard of Little Hangleton. It should have been a lot\ngloomier, that place, but in the broad daylight it seemed like\nnothing but a grassy place marked by ordinary tombstones,\ndemarcated by the chained twists of fragile, easily climbable metal\nthat Muggles used instead of wards. (Moody could not comprehend\nwhat the Muggles were thinking on that score, if they were\npretending to have wards, or what, and he had decided not\nto ask whether Muggle criminals respected the pretense.)",

Moody had once\nexpressed this thought to Lyall, who had done some ciphering and\nfiguring, and told him that a typical Dark Wizard hunter would die,\non average, eight and a half times along the way to becoming\n'paranoid'. This explained a great deal, assuming Lyall wasn't\nlying.",

      "Moody watched the fluid spiraling out of the vial and vanishing,\nto appear within the bones where marrow had once been. \"But you\nthink it's worth the effort of the trap, instead of just Vanishing\nthe bones.\"",
      "\"He does have other avenues to life, should he perceive\nthis one blocked,\" Snape said dryly, uncapping a fourth bottle.\n\"And before you ask, it must be the original grave, the place of\nfirst burial, the bone removed during the ritual and not before.\nThus he cannot have retrieved it earlier; and also there is no\npoint in substituting the skeleton of a weaker ancestor. He would\nnotice it had lost all potency.\"",
      "\"Who else knows about this trap?\" Moody demanded.",
      "\"You. Me. The Headmaster. No one else.\"",
      "Moody snorted. \"Pfah. Did Albus tell Amelia, Bartemius, and that\nMcGonagall woman about the resurrection ritual?\"",
      "\"Yes -\"",
      "\"If Voldie finds out that Albus knows about the resurrection\nritual and that Albus told them, Voldie'll figure that\nAlbus told me, and Voldie knows I'd think of\nthis.\" Moody shook his head in disgust. \"What're these other ways\nVoldie could come back to life?\"",
      "Snape's hand paused on the fifth bottle (it was all\nDisillusioned, of course, the whole operation was Disillusioned,\nbut that meant less than nothing to Moody, it just marked you in\nhis Eye's sight as trying-to-hide), and the former Death Eater\nsaid, \"You don't need to know.\"",
      "\"You're learning, son,\" said Moody with mild approval. \"What's\nin the bottles?\"",
      "Snape opened the fifth bottle, gestured with his wand to begin\nthe substance flowing toward the grave, and said, \"This one? A\nMuggle narcotic called LSD. A conversation yesterday put me in mind\nof Muggle things, and LSD seemed the most interesting option, so I\nhurried to obtain some. If it is incorporated into the resurrection\npotion, I suspect its effects will be permanent.\"",
      "\"What does it do?\" said Moody.",
      "\"It is said that the effects are impossible to describe to\nanyone who has not used it,\" drawled Snape, \"and I have not used\nit.\"",
      "Moody nodded approval as Snape opened the sixth flask. \"What\nabout that one?\"",
      "\"Love potion.\"",
      "\"Love potion?\u202f\" said Moody.",
      "\"Not of the standard sort. It is meant to trigger a two-way bond\nwith an unbearably sweet Veela woman named Verdandi who the\nHeadmaster hopes might be able to redeem even him, if they truly\nloved each other.\"",

      "\"Second flask.\"",
      "\"Iocane powder.\"",
      "\"Either the fourteenth or fifteenth bottle.\"",
      "\"Bahl's Stupefaction,\" Moody said, naming an extremely addictive\nnarcotic with interesting side effects on people with Slytherin\ntendencies; Moody had once seen an addicted Dark Wizard go to\nridiculous lengths to get a victim to lay hands on a certain exact\nportkey, instead of just having someone toss the target a trapped\nKnut on their next visit to town; and after going to all that work,\nthe addict had gone to the further effort to lay a\nsecond Portus, on the same portkey, which had, on\na second touch, transported the victim back to safety. To this day,\neven taking the drug into account, Moody could not imagine what\ncould have possibly been going through the man's mind at the time\nhe had cast the second Portus.",
      "\"Tenth vial,\" said Snape.",
      "\"Basilisk venom,\" offered Moody.",
      "\"What?\u202f\" spat Snape. \"Snake venom is a positive\ncomponent of the resurrection potion! Not to mention that it would\ndissolve the bone and all the other substances! And where would\nwe even get -\"",
      "\"Calm down, son, I was just checking to see if you could be\ntrusted.\"",
      "Mad-Eye Moody continued his (secretly unnecessary) slow turning,\nsurveying the graveyard, and the Potions Master continued\npouring.",
      "\"Hold on,\" Moody said suddenly. \"How do you know this\nis really where -\"",
      "\"Because it says 'Tom Riddle' on the easily moved headstone,\"\nSnape said dryly. \"And I have just won ten Sickles from the\nHeadmaster, who bet you would think of that before the fifth\nbottle. So much for constant vigilance.\"",
      "There was a pause.",
      "\"How long did it take Albus to reali-\"",
      "\"Three years after we learned of the ritual,\" said Snape, in a\ntone not quite like his usual sardonic drawl. \"In retrospect, we\nshould have consulted you earlier.\"",
      "Snape uncapped the ninth bottle.",
      "\"We poisoned all the other graves as well, with long-lasting\nsubstances,\" remarked the former Death Eater. \"It is\npossible that we are in the correct graveyard. He may not have\nplanned this far ahead back when he was slaughtering his family,\nand he cannot move the grave itself -\"",
      "\"The true location doesn't look like a graveyard any more,\"\nMoody said flatly. \"He moved all the other graves here and\nMemory-Charmed the Muggles. Not even Bellatrix Black would be told\nanything about that until just before the ritual started. No\none knows the true location now except him.\"",
      "They continued their futile work.",
      "Aftermath, Blaise Zabini:",
      "The Slytherin common room could be accurately and precisely\ndescribed as a remilitarized zone; the moment you stepped through\nthe portrait hole you would see that the left half of the room was\nDefinitely Not Talking to the right half and vice versa. It was\nvery clear, it did not need to be explained to anyone, that you did\nnot have the option of not taking sides.",
      "At a table in the exact middle of the room, Blaise Zabini sat by\nhimself, smirking as he did his homework. He had a reputation now,\nand meant to keep it.",
      "Aftermath, Daphne Greengrass and Tracey Davis:",

      "\"Nope,\" said Daphne.",
      "Aftermath, Harry Potter:",

      "If you went high enough in Hogwarts, you didn't see many other\npeople around, which suited Harry.",
      "There were much worse places to be trapped, Harry supposed. In\nfact you probably couldn't think of anywhere better to be\ntrapped than an ancient castle with a fractal ever-changing\nstructure that meant you couldn't ever run out of places to\nexplore, full of interesting people and interesting books and\nincredibly important knowledge unknown to Muggle science.",
      "If Harry hadn't been told that he couldn't leave, he\nprobably would've jumped at the chance to spend more time\nin Hogwarts, he would've plotted and connived to get it. Hogwarts\nwas literally optimal, not in all the realms of\npossibility maybe, but certainly on the real planet Earth, it was\nthe Maximum Fun Location.",
      "How could the castle and its grounds seem so much smaller, so\nmuch more confining, how could the rest of the world become so much\nmore interesting and important, the instant Harry had been told\nthat he wasn't allowed to leave? He'd spent months here\nand hadn't felt claustrophobic then.",
      "You know the research on this, observed some\npart of himself, it's just standard scarcity effects, like that\ntime where as soon as a county outlawed phosphate detergents,\npeople who'd never cared before drove to the next county in order\nto buy huge loads of phosphate detergent, and surveys showed that\nthey rated phosphate detergents as gentler and more effective and\neven easier-pouring... and if you give two-year-olds a choice\nbetween a toy in the open and one protected by a barrier they can\ngo around, they'll ignore the toy in the open and go for the one\nbehind the barrier... salespeople know that they can sell things\njust by telling the customer it might not be available... it was\nall in Cialdini's book Influence, everything you're\nfeeling right now, the grass is always greener on the side that's\nnot allowed.",
      "If Harry hadn't been told that he couldn't leave, he probably\nwould've jumped at the chance to stay at Hogwarts over the\nsummer...",
      "...but not the rest of his life.",
      "That was sort of the problem, really.",
      "Who knew whether there was still a Dark Lord Voldemort\nfor him to defeat?",
      "Who knew whether He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named still existed outside\nof the imagination of a possibly-not-just-pretending-to-be-crazy\nold wizard?",
      "Lord Voldemort's body had been found burned to a crisp, there\ncouldn't really be such things as souls. How could Lord Voldemort\nstill be alive? How did Dumbledore know that he was\nalive?",
      "And if there wasn't a Dark Lord, Harry couldn't defeat him, and\nhe would be trapped in Hogwarts forever.",
      "...maybe he would be legally allowed to escape after he\ngraduated his seventh year, six years and four months and three\nweeks from now. It wasn't that long as lengths of time\nwent, it only seemed like long enough for protons to\ndecay.",
      "Only it wasn't just that.",
      "It wasn't just Harry's freedom that was at stake.",
      "The Headmaster of Hogwarts, the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot,\nthe Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards,\nwas quietly sounding the alarm.",
      "A false alarm.",
      "A false alarm which Harry had triggered.",
      "You know, said the part of him that refined his skills,\ndidn't you sort of ponder, once, how every different profession\nhas a different way to be excellent, how an excellent teacher isn't\nlike an excellent plumber; but they all have in common certain\nmethods of not being stupid; and that one of the most important\nsuch techniques is to face up to your little mistakes before they\nturn into BIG mistakes?",
      "...although this already seemed to qualify as a BIG mistake,\nactually...",
      "The point being, said his inner monitor, it's\ngetting worse literally by the minute. The way spies turn people\nis, they get them to commit a little sin, and then they use the\nlittle sin to blackmail them into a bigger sin, and then they use\nTHAT sin to make them do even bigger things and then the\nblackmailer owns their soul.",
      "Didn't you once think about how the person being\nblackmailed, if they could foresee the whole path, would just\ndecide to take the punch on the first step, take the hit of\nexposing that first sin? Didn't you decide that you would do that,\nif anyone ever tried to blackmail you into doing something major in\norder to conceal something little? Do you see the similarity here,\nHarry James Potter-Evans-Verres?",
      "Only it wasn't little, it already wasn't little, there would be\na lot of very powerful people extremely angry at Harry, not just\nfor the false alarm but for freeing Bellatrix from\nAzkaban, if the Dark Lord did exist and did come\nafter him later, that war might already be lost -",
      "You don't think they'll be impressed by your honesty and\nrationality and foresight in stopping this before it snowballs even\nfurther?",
      "Harry did not, in fact, think this; and after a\nmoment's reflection, whichever part of himself he was talking to,\nhad to agree that this was absurdly optimistic.",
      "His wandering feet took him near an open window, and Harry went\nover, and leaned his arms on the ledge, and stared down at the\ngrounds of Hogwarts from high above.",
      "Brown that was barren trees, yellow that was dead grass,\nice-colored ice that was frozen creeks and frozen streams...\nwhichever school official had dubbed it 'The Forbidden Forest'\nreally hadn't understood marketing, the name just made you want to\ngo there even more. The sun was sinking in the sky, for Harry had\nbeen thinking for some hours now, thinking mostly the same thoughts\nover and over, but with key differences each time, like his\nthoughts were not going in circles, but climbing a spiral, or\ndescending it.",
      "He still couldn't believe that he'd gone through the\nentire thing with Azkaban - he'd switched off his Patronus\nbefore it took all his life, he'd stunned an Auror, he'd figured\nout how to hide Bella from the Dementors, he'd faced down twelve\nDementors and scared them away, he'd invented the rocket-assisted\nbroomstick, and ridden it - he'd gone through the entire\nthing without ever once rallying himself by thinking,\nI have to do this... because... I promised Hermione I'd come\nback from lunch! It felt like an irrevocably missed\nopportunity; like, having done it wrong that time, he\nwould never be able to get it right no matter what sort of\nchallenge he faced next time, or what promise he made. Because then\nhe would just be doing it awkwardly and deliberately to make up for\nhaving missed it the first time around, instead of making\nthe heroic declarations he could've made if he'd remembered his\npromise to Hermione. Like that one wrong turn was irrevocable, you\nonly got one chance, had to do it right on the first try...",
      "He should've remembered that promise to Hermione before\ngoing to Azkaban.",
      "Why had he decided to do that, again?",
      "My working hypothesis is that you're stupid, said\nHufflepuff.",
      "That is not a useful fault analysis, thought Harry.",
      "If you want a little more detail, said Hufflepuff,\nthe Defense Professor of Hogwarts was all like 'Let's get\nBellatrix Black out of Azkaban!' and you were like 'Okay!'",
      "Hold on, THAT'S not fair -",
      "Hey, said Hufflepuff, notice how, once you're all\nthe way up here, and the individual trees sort of blur together,\nyou can actually see the shape of the forest?",
      "Why had he done it...?",
      "Not because of any cost-benefit calculation, that was for sure.\nHe'd been too embarrassed to pull out a sheet of paper and start\ncalculating expected utilities, he'd worried that Professor\nQuirrell would stop respecting him if he said no or even hesitated\ntoo much to help a maiden in distress.",
      "He'd thought, somewhere deep inside him, that if your mysterious\nteacher offered you the first mission, the first chance, the call\nto adventure, and you said no, then your mysterious\nteacher walked away from you in disgust, and you never got another\nchance to be a hero...",
      "...yeah, that had been it. In retrospect, that had been it. He'd\ngone and started thinking his life had a plot and here was a plot\ntwist, as opposed to, oh, say, here was a proposal to break\nBellatrix Black out of Azkaban. That had been the true and\noriginal reason for the decision in the split second where it had\nbeen made, his brain perceptually recognizing the narrative where\nhe said 'no' as dissonant. And when you thought about it, that\nwasn't a rational way to make decisions. Professor Quirrell's\nulterior motive to obtain the last remains of Slytherin's lost\nlore, before Bellatrix died and it was irrevocably forgotten,\nseemed impressively sane by comparison; a benefit commensurate with\nwhat had appeared at the time as a small risk.",
      "It didn't seem fair, it didn't seem fair, that\nthis was what happened if he lost his grip on his\nrationality for just a tiny fraction of a second, the tiny fraction\nof a second required for his brain to decide to be more comfortable\nwith 'yes' arguments than 'no' arguments during the discussion that\nhad followed.",
      "From high above, far enough above that the individual trees\nblurred together, Harry stared out at the forest.",
      "Harry didn't want to confess and ruin his reputation\nforever and get everyone angry at him and maybe end up killed by\nthe Dark Lord later. He'd rather be trapped in Hogwarts for six\nyears than face that. That was how he felt. And so it was in fact\nhelpful, a relief, to be able to cling to a single decisive factor,\nwhich was that if Harry confessed, Professor Quirrell would go to\nAzkaban and die there.",
      "(A catch, a break, a stutter in Harry's breathing.)",
      "If you phrased it that way... why, you could even\npretend to be a hero, instead of a coward.",
      "Harry lifted his eyes from the Forbidden Forest, looked up at\nthe clear blue forbidden sky.",
      "Stared out the glass panes at the big bright burning thing, the\nfluffy things, the mysterious endless blue in which they were\nembedded, that strange new unknown place.",
      "It... actually did help, it helped quite a lot, to think that\nhis own troubles were nothing compared to being in Azkaban. That\nthere were people in the world who were really in trouble\nand Harry Potter was not one of them.",
      "What was he going to do about Azkaban?",
      "What was he going to do about magical Britain?",
      "...which side was he on, now?",
      "In the bright light of day, everything that Albus Dumbledore had\nsaid certainly sounded a lot wiser than Professor\nQuirrell. Better and brighter, more moral, more\nconvenient, wouldn't it be nice if it were true. And the\nthing to remember was that Dumbledore believed things\nbecause they sounded nice, but Professor Quirrell was the\none who was sane.",
      "(Again the catch in his breathing, it happened each time he\nthought of Professor Quirrell.)",
      "But just because something sounded nice, didn't make it\nwrong, either.",
      "And if the Defense Professor did have a flaw in his\nsanity, it was that his outlook on life was too\nnegative.",
      "Really? inquired the part of Harry that had read\neighteen million experimental results about people being too\noptimistic and overconfident. Professor Quirrell is too\npessimistic? So pessimistic that his expectations routinely\nundershoot reality? Stuff him and put him in a museum, he's\nunique. Which one of you two planned the perfect crime, and\nthen put in all the error margin and fallbacks that ended up\nsaving your butt, just in case the perfect crime went\nwrong? Hint hint, his name wasn't Harry Potter.",
      "But \"pessimistic\" wasn't the correct word to describe Professor\nQuirrell's problem - if a problem it truly was, and not the\nsuperior wisdom of experience. But to Harry it looked like\nProfessor Quirrell was constantly interpreting everything in the\nworst possible light. If you handed Professor Quirrell a glass that\nwas 90% full, he'd tell you that the 10% empty part proved that no\none really cared about water.",
      "That was a very good analogy, now that Harry thought about it.\nNot all of magical Britain was like Azkaban, that glass was well\nover half full...",
      "Harry stared up at the bright blue sky.",
      "...although, following the analogy, if Azkaban existed,\nthen maybe it did prove that the 90% good part was there\nfor other reasons, people trying to make a show of\nkindness as Professor Quirrell had put it. For if they were\ntruly kind they would not have made Azkaban, they would storm the\nfortress to tear it down... wouldn't they?",
      "Harry stared up at the bright blue sky. If you wanted to be a\nrationalist you had to read an awful lot of papers on flaws in\nhuman nature, and some of those flaws were innocent logical\nfailures, and some of them looked a lot darker.",
      "Harry stared up at the bright blue sky, and thought of the\nMilgram experiment.",
      "Stanley Milgram had done it to investigate the causes of World\nWar II, to try to understand why the citizens of Germany had obeyed\nHitler.",
      "So he had designed an experiment to investigate\nobedience, to see if Germans were, for some reason, more\nliable to obey harmful orders from authority figures.",
      "First he'd run a pilot version of his experiment on American\nsubjects, as a control.",
      "And afterward he hadn't bothered trying it in Germany.",
      "Experimental apparatus: A series of 30 switches set in a\nhorizontal line, with labels starting at '15 volts' and going up to\n'450 volts', with labels for each group of four switches. The first\ngroup of four labeled 'Slight Shock', the sixth group labeled\n'Extreme Intensity Shock', the seventh group labeled 'Danger:\nSevere Shock', and the two last switches left over labeled just\n'XXX'.",
      "And an actor, a confederate of the experimenter, who had\nappeared to the true subjects to be someone just like them: someone\nwho had answered the same ad for participants in an experiment on\nlearning, and who had lost a (rigged) lottery and been strapped\ninto a chair, along with the electrodes. The true experimental\nsubjects had been given a slight shock from the electrodes, just so\nthat they could see that it worked.",
      "The true subject had been told that the experiment was on the\neffects of punishment on learning and memory, and that part of the\ntest was to see if it made a difference what sort of person\nadministered the punishment; and that the person strapped to the\nchair would try to memorize sets of word pairs, and that each time\nthe 'learner' got one wrong, the 'teacher' was to administer a\nsuccessively stronger shock.",
      "At the 300-volt level, the actor would stop trying to call out\nanswers and begin kicking at the wall, after which the experimenter\nwould instruct the subjects to treat non-answers as wrong answers\nand continue.",
      "At the 315-volt level the pounding on the wall would be\nrepeated.",
      "After that nothing would be heard.",
      "If the subject objected or refused to press a switch, the\nexperimenter, maintaining an impassive demeanor and dressed in a\ngray lab coat, would say 'Please continue', then 'The experiment\nrequires that you continue', then 'It is absolutely essential that\nyou continue', then 'You have no other choice, you must go\non'. If the fourth prod still didn't work, the experiment halted\nthere.",
      "Before running the experiment, Milgram had described the\nexperimental setup, and then asked fourteen psychology seniors what\npercentage of subjects they thought would go all the way\nup to the 450-volt level, what percentage of subjects would press\nthe last of the two switches marked XXX, after the victim had\nstopped responding.",
      "The most pessimistic answer had been 3%.",
      "The actual number had been 26 out of 40.",
      "The subjects had sweated, groaned, stuttered, laughed nervously,\nbitten their lips, dug their fingernails into their flesh. But at\nthe experimenter's prompting, they had, most of them, gone on\nadministering what they believed to be painful, dangerous, possibly\nlethal electrical shocks. All the way to the end.",
      "Harry could hear Professor Quirrell laughing, in his mind; the\nDefense Professor's voice saying something along the lines of:\nWhy, Mr. Potter, even I had not been so cynical; I knew men\nwould betray their most cherished principles for money and power,\nbut I did not realize that a stern look also sufficed.",
      "It was dangerous, to try and guess at evolutionary psychology if\nyou weren't a professional evolutionary psychologist; but when\nHarry had read about the Milgram experiment, the thought had\noccurred to him that situations like this had probably arisen many\ntimes in the ancestral environment, and that most potential\nancestors who'd tried to disobey Authority were dead. Or that they\nhad, at least, done less well for themselves than the obedient.\nPeople thought themselves good and moral, but when push\ncame to shove, some switch flipped in their brain, and it was\nsuddenly a lot harder to heroically defy Authority than they\nthought. Even if you could do it, it wouldn't be easy, it wouldn't\nbe some effortless display of heroism. You would tremble, your\nvoice would break, you would be afraid; would you be able to defy\nAuthority even then?",
      "Harry blinked, then; because his brain had just made the\nconnection between Milgram's experiment and what Hermione had done\non her first day of Defense class, she'd refused to shoot a fellow\nstudent, even when Authority had told her that she must, she had\ntrembled and been afraid but she had still refused. Harry had seen\nthat happen right in front of his own eyes and he still hadn't made\nthe connection until now...",
      "Harry stared down at the reddening horizon, the Sun was sinking\nlower, the sky fading, darkening, even if most of it was still\nblue, soon it would turn to night. The gold and red colors of Sun\nand sunset reminded him of Fawkes; and Harry wondered, for a\nmoment, if it must be a sad thing to be a phoenix, and call and cry\nand scream without being heeded.",
      "But Fawkes would never give up, as many times as he died he\nwould always be reborn, for Fawkes was a being of light and fire,\nand despairing over Azkaban belonged to the darkness just as much\nas did Azkaban itself.",
      "If you were given a glass half-empty and half-full, then that\nwas the way reality was, that was the truth and it was so; but you\nstill had a choice of how to feel about it, whether you\nwould despair over the empty half or rejoice in the water that was\nthere.",
      "Milgram had tried certain other variations on his test.",
      "In the eighteenth experiment, the experimental subject had only\nneeded to call out the test words to the victim strapped into the\nchair, and record the answers, while someone else pressed\nthe switches. It was the same apparent suffering, the same frantic\npounding followed by silence; but it wasn't you pressing\nthe switch. You just watched it happen, and read the\nquestions to the person being tortured.",
      "37 of 40 subjects had continued their participation in that\nexperiment to the end, the 450-volt end marked 'XXX'.",
      "And if you were Professor Quirrell, you might have decided to\nfeel cynical about that.",
      "But 3 out of 40 subjects had refused to participate all\nthe way to the end.",
      "The Hermiones.",
      "They did exist, in the world, the people who wouldn't fire a\nSimple Strike Hex at a fellow student even if the Defense Professor\nordered them to do it. The ones who had sheltered Gypsies and Jews\nand homosexuals in their attics during the Holocaust, and sometimes\nlost their lives for it.",
      "And were those people from some other species than humanity? Did\nthey have some extra gear in their heads, some additional chunk of\nneural circuitry, which lesser mortals did not possess? But that\nwas not likely, given the logic of sexual reproduction which said\nthat the genes for complex machinery would be scrambled beyond\nrepair, if they were not universal.",
      "Whatever parts Hermione was made from, everyone had those same\nparts inside them somewhere...",
      "...well, that was a nice thought but it wasn't strictly\ntrue, there was such a thing as literal brain damage, people could\nlose genes and the complex machine could stop working,\nthere were sociopaths and psychopaths, people who lacked the gear\nto care. Maybe Lord Voldemort had been born like that, or maybe he\nhad known good and yet still chosen evil; at this point it didn't\nmatter in the slightest. But a supermajority of the\npopulation ought to be capable of learning to do what Hermione and\nHolocaust resisters did.",
      "The people who had been run through the Milgram experiment, who\nhad trembled and sweated and nervously laughed as they went all the\nway to pressing the switches marked 'XXX', many of them had written\nto thank Milgram, afterward, for what they had learned about\nthemselves. That, too, was part of the story, the legend of that\nlegendary experiment.",
      "The Sun had almost sunk below the horizon now, a last golden tip\npeeking above the faraway tops of trees.",
      "Harry looked at it, that tip of Sun, his glasses were supposed\nto be proof against UV so he ought to be able to look directly at\nit without damaging his eyes.",
      "Harry stared directly at it, that tiny fraction of the Light\nthat was not obscured and blocked and hidden, even if it was only 3\nparts out of 40, the other 37 parts were there somewhere. The 7.5%\nof the glass that was full, which proved that people really did\ncare about water, even if that force of caring within themselves\nwas too often defeated. If people truly didn't care, the glass\nwould have been truly empty. If everyone had been like You-Know-Who\ninside, secretly cleverly selfish, there would have been no\nresisters to the Holocaust at all.",
      "Harry looked at the sunset, on the second day of the rest of his\nlife, and knew that he had switched sides.",
      "Because he couldn't believe in it any more, he couldn't really,\nnot after going to Azkaban. He couldn't do what 37 out of 40 people\nwould vote for him to do. Everyone might have inside them what it\ntook to be Hermione, and someday they might learn; but\nsomeday wasn't now, not here, not today, not in\nthe real world. If you were on the side of 3 out of 40 people then\nyou weren't a political majority, and Professor Quirrell had been\nright, Harry would not bow his head in submission when that\nhappened.",
      "There was a sort of awful appropriateness to it. You shouldn't\ngo to Azkaban and come back having not changed your mind about\nanything important.",
      "So is Professor Quirrell right, then? asked Slytherin.\nLeaving out whether he's good or evil, is he right?\nAre you, to them, whether they know it or not, their next Lord?\nWe'll just leave out the Dark part, that's him being cynical again.\nBut is it your intention now to rule? I've got to say, that makes\neven me nervous.",
      "Do you think you can be trusted with power? said\nGryffindor. Isn't there some sort of rule that people who want\npower shouldn't have it? Maybe we should make Hermione the ruler\ninstead.",
      "Do you think you're fit to run a society and not have it\ncollapse into total chaos inside of three weeks flat? said\nHufflepuff. Imagine how loudly Mum would scream if she'd heard\nyou'd been elected Prime Minister, now ask yourself, are you sure\nshe's wrong about that?",
      "Actually, said Ravenclaw, I have to point out that\nall this political stuff sounds overwhelmingly boring. How about if\nwe leave all the electioneering to Draco and stick to science? It's\nwhat we're actually good at, and that's been known to improve the\nhuman condition too, y'know.",
      "Slow down, thought Harry at his components, we\ndon't have to decide everything right now. We're allowed to ponder\nthe problem as fully as possible before coming to a\nsolution.",
      "The last part of the Sun sank below the horizon.",
      "It was strange, this feeling of not quite knowing who you were,\nwhich side you were on, of having not already made up your\nmind about something as major as that, there was an unfamiliar\nsensation of freedom in it...",
      "And that reminded him of what Professor Quirrell had said to his\nlast question, which reminded him of Professor Quirrell, which made\nit hard once more to breathe, started that burning sensation in\nHarry's throat, sent his thoughts around that loop of the climbing\nspiral once again.",
      "Why was he so sad, now, whenever he thought of Professor\nQuirrell? Harry was used to knowing himself, and he didn't know why\nhe felt so sad...",
      "It felt like he'd lost Professor Quirrell forever, lost him in\nAzkaban, that was how it felt. As surely as if the Defense\nProfessor had been eaten by Dementors, consumed in the empty\nvoids.",
      "Lost him! Why did I lose him? Because he said Avada Kedavra\nand there was in fact a perfectly good reason even though I didn't\nsee it for a couple of hours? Why can't things go back to the way\nthey were?",
      "But then it hadn't been the Avada Kedavra. That might\nhave played a part in irreversibly collapsing a structure of\nrationalizations and flinches and carefully not thinking about\ncertain things. But it hadn't been the Avada Kedavra, that hadn't\nbeen the disturbing thing that Harry had seen.",
      "What did I see...?",
      "Harry looked at the fading sky.",
      "He'd seen Professor Quirrell turn into a hardened criminal while\nfacing the Auror, and the apparent change of personalities had been\neffortless, and complete.",
      "Another woman had known the Defense Professor as 'Jeremy\nJaffe'.",
      "How many different people are you, anyway?",
      "I cannot say that I bothered keeping count.",
      "You couldn't help but wonder...",
      "...whether 'Professor Quirrell' was just one more name on the\nlist, just one more person that had been turned into, made\nup in the service of some unguessable goal.",
      "Harry would always be wondering now, every time he talked to\nProfessor Quirrell, if it was a mask, and what motive was behind\nthat mask. With every dry smile, Harry would be trying to see what\nwas pulling the levers on the lips.",
      "Is that how other people will start thinking of me, if I get\ntoo Slytherin? If I pull off too many plots, will I never be able\nto smile at anyone again, without them wondering what I really mean\nby it?",
      "Maybe there was some way to restore a trust in surface\nappearances and make a normal human relationship possible again,\nbut Harry couldn't think of what it might be.",
      "That was how Harry had lost Professor Quirrell, not the person,\nbut the... connection...",
      "Why did that hurt so much?",
      "Why did it feel so lonely, now?",
      "Surely there were other people, maybe better people, to trust\nand befriend? Professor McGonagall, Professor Flitwick, Hermione,\nDraco, not to mention Mum and Dad, it wasn't like Harry was\nalone...",
      "Only...",
      "A choking sensation grew in Harry's throat as he understood.",
      "Only Professor McGonagall, Professor Flitwick, Hermione, Draco,\nthey all of them sometimes knew things that Harry didn't,\nbut...",
      "They did not excel above Harry within his own sphere of\npower; such genius as they possessed was not like his genius, and\nhis genius was not like theirs; he might look upon them as peers,\nbut not look up to them as his superiors.",
      "None of them had been, none of them could ever be...",
      "Harry's mentor...",
      "That was who Professor Quirrell had been.",
      "That was who Harry had lost.",
      "And the manner in which he had lost his first mentor might or\nmight not allow Harry to ever get him back. Maybe someday he would\nknow all Professor Quirrell's hidden purposes and the doubts\nbetween them would go away; but even if that seemed possible, it\ndidn't seem very probable.",
      "There was a gust of wind, outside Hogwarts, it bent the empty\ntrees, rippled the lake whose heart was still unfrozen, made a\nwhispering sound as it slid past the window that looked upon the\nhalf-twilit world, and Harry's thoughts wandered outward for a\ntime.",
      "Then returned inward again, to the next step of the spiral.",
      "Why am I different from the other children my age?",
      "If Professor Quirrell's answer to that had been an evasion, then\nit was a very well-calculated one. Deep enough and complex enough,\nsufficiently full of suggestions of hidden meaning, to serve as a\ntrap for a Ravenclaw who couldn't be diverted by less. Or maybe\nProfessor Quirrell had meant his answer honestly. Who knew what\nmotive might have pulled that lever on those lips?",
      "I will say this much, Mr. Potter: You are already an\nOcclumens, and I think you will become a perfect Occlumens before\nlong. Identity does not mean, to such as us, what it means to other\npeople. Anyone we can imagine, we can be; and the true difference\nabout you, Mr. Potter, is that you have an unusually good\nimagination. A playwright must contain his characters, he must be\nlarger than them in order to enact them within his mind. To an\nactor or spy or politician, the limit of his own diameter is the\nlimit of who he can pretend to be, the limit of which face he may\nwear as a mask. But for such as you and I, anyone we can imagine,\nwe can be, in reality and not pretense. While you\nimagined yourself a child, Mr. Potter, you were a child.\nYet there are other existences you could support, larger\nexistences, if you wished. Why are you so free, and so great in\nyour circumference, when other children your age are small and\nconstrained? Why can you imagine and become selves more\nadult than a mere child of a playwright should be able to compose?\nThat I do not know, and I must not say what I guess. But what you\nhave, Mr. Potter, is freedom.",
      "If that was a snow job it was one heck of a distracting one.",
      "And the still more worrisome thought was that Professor Quirrell\nhadn't realized how disturbed Harry would be, how\nwrong that speech would sound to him, how much damage it\nwould do to his trust in Professor Quirrell.",
      "There ought to always be one real person who you truly\nwere, at the center of everything...",
      "Harry stared out at the falling night, the gathering\ndarkness.",
      "...right?",
      "It was almost bedtime when Hermione heard the scattered intakes\nof breath and looked up from her copy of Beauxbatons: A\nHistory to see the missing boy, the boy who had been misplaced\nat lunch that Sunday, whose dinner nonappearance had been\naccompanied by rumors - and she hadn't believed them because they\nwere completely ridiculous, but she'd felt a little\nqueasiness inside - that he'd withdrawn from Hogwarts in order to\nhunt down Bellatrix Black.",
      "\"Harry!\u202f\" she shrieked, she didn't even realize that\nshe was talking directly to him for the first time in a week, or\nnotice how some other students started at the sound of her yelling\nall the way across the Ravenclaw common room.",
      "Harry's eyes had already lifted to her, he was already walking\ntoward her, so she stopped halfway out of her chair -",
      "A few moments later, Harry was seated across from her, and he\nwas putting away his wand after casting a Quieting barrier around\nthem.",
      "(And an awful lot of Ravenclaws were trying not to look like\nthey were watching.)",
      "\"Hey,\" Harry said. His voice wavered. \"I missed you. You're...\ngoing to talk to me again, now?\"",
      "Hermione nodded, she just nodded, she couldn't think of what to\nsay. She'd missed Harry too, but she was realizing, with a guilty\nsort of feeling, that it might've been a lot worse for him. She had\nother friends, Harry... it didn't feel fair, sometimes,\nthat Harry talked to only her like that, so that she had\nto talk to him; but Harry had a look about him like unfair things\nhad been happening to him, too.",
      "\"What's been going on?\u202f\" she said. \"There's all sorts\nof rumors. There were people saying you'd run off to fight\nBellatrix Black, there were people saying you'd run off to\njoin Bellatrix Black -\" and those rumors had said\nthat Hermione had just made up the thing about the phoenix, and\nshe'd yelled that the whole Ravenclaw common room had seen it, so\nthen the next rumor had claimed she'd made up that part\ntoo, which was stupidity of such an inconceivable level that it\nleft her completely flabbergasted.",
      "\"I can't talk about it,\" Harry said in a bare whisper. \"Can't\ntalk about a lot of it. I wish I could tell you everything,\" his\nvoice wavered, \"but I can't... I guess, if it helps or anything,\nI'm not going to lunch with Professor Quirrell any more...\"",
      "Harry put his hands over his face, then, covering his eyes.",
      "Hermione felt the queasy feeling all through her stomach.",
      "\"Are you crying?\" said Hermione.",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Harry, his voice sounding a little breathy. \"I\ndon't want anyone else to see.\"",
      "There was a little silence. Hermione wanted to help but she\ndidn't know what to do about a boy crying, and she didn't know what\nwas happening; she felt like huge things were happening around her\n- no, around Harry - and if she knew what they were she would\nprobably be scared, or alarmed, or something, but she didn't know\nanything.",
      "\"Did Professor Quirrell do something wrong?\" she said at\nlast.",
      "\"That's not why I can't go to lunch with him any more,\" Harry\nsaid, still in that bare whisper with his hands pressed over his\neyes. \"That was the Headmaster's decision. But yeah, Professor\nQuirrell said some things to me that made me trust him less, I\nguess...\" Harry's voice sounded very shaky. \"I'm feeling kind of\nalone right now.\"",
      "Hermione put her hand on her cheek where Fawkes had touched her\nyesterday. She'd kept thinking about that touch, over and over,\nmaybe because she wanted it to be important, to mean\nsomething to her...",
      "\"Is there any way I can help?\" she said.",
      "\"I want to do something normal,\" Harry said from behind his\nhands. \"Something very normal for first-year Hogwarts students.\nSomething eleven-year-olds and twelve-year-olds like us are\nsupposed to do. Like play a game of Exploding Snap or\nsomething... I don't suppose you have the cards or know the rules\nor anything like that?\"",
      "\"Um... I don't know the rules, actually...\" said\nHermione. \"I know they explode.\"",
      "\"I don't suppose Gobstones?\" said Harry.",
      "\"Don't know the rules and they spit at you. Those are\nboy games, Harry!\"",
      "There was a pause. Harry ground his hands against his face to\nwipe it, and then took his hands away; and then he was looking at\nher, looking a little helpless. \"Well,\" Harry said, \"what\ndo wizards and witches our age do, when they play, you\nknow, the kind of pointless silly games we're supposed to\nplay at this age?\"",
      "\"Hopscotch?\" said Hermione. \"Jump-rope? Unicorn attack?\nI don't know, I read books!\"",
      "Harry started laughing, and Hermione started giggling along with\nhim even though she didn't know quite why, but it was\nfunny.",
      "\"I guess that helped a little,\" said Harry. \"Actually I think it\nhelped more than playing Gobstones for an hour could've possibly\nhelped, so thanks for being you. And no matter what, I'm\nnot having anyone Obliviate everything I know about\ncalculus. I'd sooner die.\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" said Hermione. \"Why - why would you\never want to do that?\u202f\"",
      "Harry stood up from the table, and there was a rush of restored\nbackground noise as his rise broke the Quieting Charm. \"I'm a tad\nsleepy so I'm going off to bed,\" Harry said, now his voice was\nordinary and wry, \"I've got some lost time to make up for, but I'll\nsee you at breakfast, and then at Herbology, if that's all right.\nNot to mention it wouldn't be fair to dump all my depression on\nyou. G'night, Hermione.\"",
      "\"Good night, Harry,\" she said, feeling very confused and\nalarmed. \"Pleasant dreams.\"",
      "Harry stumbled a little as she said that, and then he continued\non toward the stairs that led to the first-year-boys' dorms.",
      "Harry turned the Quieting Charm all the way up, on the head of\nhis bedboard, so that he wouldn't wake anyone else up if he\nscreamed.",
      "Set his alarm to wake him up for breakfast (if he wasn't up\nalready by that hour, if indeed he slept at all).",
      "Got into bed, laid down -",
      "- felt the lump beneath his pillow.",
      "Harry stared up at the canopy above his bed.",
      "Hissed under his breath, \"Oh, you've got to be kidding\nme...\"",
      "It took a few seconds before Harry could muster the heart to sit\nup in bed, pull the blanket over himself and his pillow to obscure\nthe deed from the other boys, cast a low-intensity Lumos\nand see what was under his pillow.",
      "There was a parchment, and a deck of playing cards.",
      "The parchment read,",
      "A little bird told me that Dumbledore has shut the door of\nyour cage.",
      "I must admit, on this occasion, that Dumbledore may have a\npoint. Bellatrix Black is loosed upon the world once more, and that\nis not good news for any good person. If I stood in Dumbledore's\nplace, I might well do the same.",
      "But just in case... The Salem Witches' Institute in America\naccepts boys as well, despite the name. They are good people and\nwould protect you even from Dumbledore, if you needed it. Britain\nholds that you need Dumbledore's permission to emigrate to magical\nAmerica, but magical America disagrees. So in the final extremity,\nget outside the wards of Hogwarts and tear in half the King of\nHearts from this deck of cards.",
      "That you should resort to it only in the final extremity\ngoes without saying.",
      "Be well, Harry Potter.",
      "- Santa Claus",
      "Harry stared down at the pack of cards.",
      "It couldn't take him anywhere else, not right now,\nportkeys didn't work here.",
      "But he still felt unnerved about the prospect of picking it up,\neven to hide it inside his trunk...",
      "Well, he'd already picked up the parchment, which could\njust as easily have been enchanted with a trap, if a trap was\ninvolved.",
      "But still.",
      "\"Wingardium Leviosa,\" Harry whispered, and Hovered the packet of\ncards to lie next to where his alarm clock rested in a pocket of\nthe headboard. He'd deal with it tomorrow.",
      "And then Harry lay back in bed, and closed his eyes, to dream\nwithout any phoenix to protect him, and pay his reckoning.",
      "He came awake with a gasp of horror, not a scream, he'd yet to\nscream this night, but his blanket was all tangled around him from\nwhere his sleeping form had jerked as he dreamed of running, trying\nto get away from the gaps in space that were pursuing him through a\ncorridor of metal lit by dim gaslight, an endlessly long corridor\nof metal lit by dim gaslight, and he hadn't known, in the\ndream, that touching those voids meant he would die horribly and\nleave his still-breathing body empty behind him, all he'd known was\nthat he had to run and run and run from the wounds in the world\nsliding after him -",
      "Harry started to cry again, it wasn't for the horror of the\nchase, it was that he'd run away while someone behind him was\nscreaming for help, screaming for him to come back and save her,\nhelp her, she was being eaten, she was going to die, and in the\ndream Harry had run away instead of helping her.",
      "\"DON'T GO!\" The voice came in a scream from behind the metal\ndoor. \"No, no, no, don't go, don't take it away, don't don't don't\n-\"",
      "Why had Fawkes ever rested on his shoulder? He'd walked away.\nFawkes should hate him.",
      "Fawkes should hate Dumbledore. He'd walked away.",
      "Fawkes should hate everyone -",
      "The boy wasn't awake, wasn't dreaming, his thoughts were jumbled\nand confused in the shadowlands that bordered sleep and waking,\nunprotected by the safety rails that his aware mind imposed on\nitself, the careful rules and censors. In that shadowland his brain\nhad woken up enough to think, but something else was too sleepy to\nact; his thoughts ran free and wild, unconstrained by his\nself-concept, his waking self's ideals of what he shouldn't think.\nThat was the freedom of his brain's dreams, as his self-concept\nslept. Free to repeat, over and over, Harry's new worst\nnightmare:",
      "\"No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!\"",
      "\"No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!\"",
      "\"No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!\"",
      "A rage grew in him alongside the self-loathing, a terrible hot\nwrath / icy cold hatred, for the world which had done that to her /\nfor himself, and in his half-awake state Harry fantasized escapes,\nfantasized ways out of the moral dilemma, he imagined himself\nhovering above the vast triangular horror of Azkaban, and\nwhispering an incantation unlike any syllables that had ever been\nheard before on Earth, whispers that echoed all the way across the\nsky and were heard on the other side of the world, and there was a\nblast of silver Patronus fire like a nuclear explosion that tore\napart all the Dementors in an instant and ripped apart the metal\nwalls of Azkaban, shattered the long corridors and all the dim\norange lights, and then a moment later his brain remembered that\nthere were people in there, and rewrote the half-dream fantasy to\nshow all the prisoners laughing as they flew away in flocks from\nthe burning wreck of Azkaban, the silver light restoring the flesh\nto their limbs as they flew, and Harry started crying harder into\nhis pillow, because he couldn't do it, because he wasn't God -",
      "He'd sworn upon his life and magic and his art as a rationalist,\nhe'd sworn by all he held sacred and all his happy memories, he'd\ngiven his oath so now he had to do something, had to do\nsomething, had to DO SOMETHING -",
      "Maybe it was pointless.",
      "Maybe trying to follow rules was pointless.",
      "Maybe you just burned down Azkaban however.",
      "And in fact he'd sworn he'd do it, so now that was what he had\nto do.",
      "He'd just do whatever it took to get rid of Azkaban, that was\nall. If that meant ruling Britain, fine, if that meant finding a\nspell to whisper that would echo all across the sky, whatever, the\nimportant thing was to destroy Azkaban.",
      "That was the side he was on, that was who he was, so there, it\nwas done.",
      "His waking mind would have demanded a lot more details before\naccepting that as an answer, but in his half-dreaming state it felt\nlike enough of a resolution to let his tired mind fall truly asleep\nagain, and dream the next nightmare.",
      "Final Aftermath:",
      "She came awake with a gasp of horror, a disruption of her\nbreathing that left her feeling deprived of air and yet her lungs\ndidn't move, she woke up with an unvoiced scream on her lips and no\nwords, no words came forth, for she could not understand what she\nhad seen, she could not understand what she had seen, it\nwas too large for her to encompass and still taking shape, she\ncould not put words to that formless shape and so she could not\ndischarge it, could not discharge it and become innocent and\nunknowing once more.",
      "\"What time is it?\" she whispered.",
      "Her golden jeweled alarm clock, the beautiful and magical and\nexpensive alarm clock that the Headmaster had given her as a gift\nupon her employment at Hogwarts, whispered back, \"Around two in the\nmorning. Go back to sleep.\"",
      "Her sheets were soaked in sweat, her nightclothes soaked in\nsweat, she took her wand from beside the pillow and cleaned herself\nup before she tried to go back to sleep, she tried to go back to\nsleep and eventually succeeded.",

      "Frodo glanced at all the faces, but they were not turned to him.\nAll the Council sat with downcast eyes, as if in deep thought. A\ngreat dread fell on him, as if he was awaiting the pronouncement of\nsome doom that he had long foreseen and vainly hoped might after\nall never be spoken. An overwhelming longing to rest and remain at\npeace by Bilbo's side in Rivendell filled all his heart. At last\nwith an effort he spoke, and wondered to hear his own words, as if\nsome other will was using his small voice.",
      "\"We cannot,\" said Frodo. \"We must not. Do you not see? It is\nexactly what the Enemy desires. All of this he has foreseen.\"",
      "The faces turned to him, puzzled the Dwarves and grave the\nElves; sternness in the eyes of the Men; and so keen the gazes of\nElrond and of Gandalf that Frodo almost could not withstand it. It\nwas very hard, then, not to grasp the Ring in his hand, and harder\nstill not to put it on, to face them as only Frodo.",
      "\"Do you not question it?\" Frodo said, thin like the wind his\nvoice, and wavering like a breeze. \"You have chosen, of all things,\nto send the Ring into Mordor; should you not wonder? How did it\ncome to this? That we might, of all our choices, do that single\nthing our Enemy most desires? Perhaps the Cracks of Doom are\nalready guarded, strongly enough to hold off Gandalf and Elrond and\nGlorfindel all together; or perhaps the Master of that place has\ncooled the lava there, set it to trap the Ring so that he may\nsimply bring it out after it is thrown in...\" A memory of awful\nclarity came over Frodo then, and a flash of black laughter, and\nthe thought came to him that it was just what the Enemy\nwould do. Only the thought came to him so: thus it would amuse\nme to do, if I meant to rule...",
      "There were doubtful glances exchanged within the council; Gl\u00f3in\nand Gimli and Boromir were now looking at the Elves more\nskeptically than before, like they had awoken out of a dream of\nwords.",
      "\"The Enemy is very wise,\" said Gandalf, \"and weighs all things\nto a nicety in the scales of his malice. But the only measure that\nhe knows is desire, desire for power; and so he judges all hearts.\nInto his heart the thought will not enter that any will refuse it,\nthat having the Ring we may seek to destroy it -\"",
      "\"He will think of it!\" cried Frodo. He struggled for\nwords, trying to convey things that had once seemed perfect in his\ncomprehension, and then faded like melting snow. \"If the Enemy\nthought that all his foes were moved by desire for power alone - he\nwould guess wrongly, over and over, and the Maker of this Ring\nwould see that, he would know that somewhere he\nhad made a mistake!\" Frodo's hands stretched forth pleadingly.",
      "Boromir stirred, and his voice was doubtful. \"You speak fair of\nthe Enemy,\" said Boromir, \"for one of his foes.\"",
      "Frodo's mouth opened and shut in desperate bewilderment; for\nFrodo knew, he knew the Man was mad, but he could think of nothing\nto say.",
      "Then Bilbo spoke, and his withered voice silenced the whole\nroom, even Elrond who had been about to speak. \"Frodo is right, I\nfear,\" whispered the old hobbit. \"I remember, I remember what it\nwas like. To see with the Black Sight. I remember. The Enemy will\nthink that we might not trust one another, that the weaker among us\nwill propose to destroy the Ring so that the stronger may not have\nit. He knows that even one not truly good might still cry to\ndestroy the Ring, to make a show of pretended goodness. And the\nEnemy will not think it impossible that such a decision be\nmade by this council, for you see, he does not trust us to be\nwise.\" A whispering chuckle rose from the ancient hobbit's throat.\n\"And if he did - why, he would still guard the Cracks of\nDoom. It would cost him little.\"",
      "Now foreboding was on the faces even of the Elves, and the Wise;\nElrond had frowned, and the sharp eyebrows of Gandalf furrowed.",
      "Frodo gazed at them all, feeling a wildness come over him, a\ndespair; and as his heart weakened a shadow came over his vision, a\ndarkness and a wavering. From within the shadow Frodo saw Gandalf,\nand the wizard's strength was revealed as weakness, and his wisdom\nfolly. For Frodo knew, as the Ring seemed to drag and weigh on his\nbreast, that Gandalf had not thought at all of history and lore,\nwhen the wizard spoke of how the Enemy would not understand any\ndesire save power; that Gandalf had not remembered how Sauron had\ncast down and corrupted the Men of N\u00famenor in the days of their\nglory. Just as it had not occurred to Gandalf that the Enemy might\nlearn to comprehend foes of goodwill by looking...",
      "Frodo's gaze swung to Elrond, but there was no hope there, no\nanswer and no rescue in the shadowy vision; for Elrond had let\nIsildur go, carrying the Ring from the Cracks of Doom where it\nshould have been destroyed, to the cost of all this war. Not for\nIsildur's own sake, not for friendship had it been done, for the\nRing had killed Isildur in the end, and far worse fates could have\nfollowed him. But the Doom that had stemmed from Isildur's deed\nwould have seemed unsure to Elrond then, unsure and distant in\ntime; and yet the cost to Elrond himself of taking his sword's\npommel to the back of Isildur's head would have been surer, and\nnearer...",
      "As though in desperation, Frodo turned to look at Aragorn, the\nweathered man who had donned his travel-worn clothes for this\ncouncil, the heir of kings who spoke softly to hobbits. But Frodo's\nvision seemed to double, and in the shadowy second image Frodo saw\na Man who had spent too much of his youth among Elves, who had\nlearned to wear humble and stained clothes amid the gold and\njewels, knowing he could not match them wisdom for wisdom, and\nhoping to outplay them in a fashion they would not emulate...",
      "In the sight of the Ring, which was the sight of the Ring's own\nMaker, all noble things faded into stratagems and lies, a world of\ngrey and darkness without any light. They had not made their\nchoices knowingly, Gandalf or Elrond or Aragorn; the impulses had\ncome from the dark hidden parts of themselves, the black secret\ndepths which the Ring had rendered plain in Frodo's vision. Would\nthey outthink the Shadow, when they could not comprehend even their\nown selves, or the forces that moved them?",
      "\"Frodo!\" came the sharp whisper of Bilbo's voice, and Frodo came\nto himself, and halted his hand reaching up toward where the Ring\nlay on his breast, on its chain, dragging like a vast stone around\nhis neck.",
      "Reaching up to grasp the Ring wherein all answers lay.",
      "\"How did you bear this thing?\" Frodo whispered to Bilbo, as if\nthe two of them were the only souls in the room, though all the\nCouncil watched them. \"For years? I cannot imagine it.\"",
      "\"I kept it locked in a room to which only Gandalf had the key,\"\nsaid his uncle, \"and when I began to imagine ways to open it, I\nremembered Gollum.\"",
      "A shudder went through Frodo, remembering the tales. The horror\nof the Misty Mountains, thinking, always thinking in the dark;\nruling the goblins from the shadows and filling the tunnels with\ntraps; but for Bilbo wearing the ring that first time not a single\ndwarf would have lived. And now, Legolas the Elf had told them,\nGollum had given up on sending his agents against the Shire, had at\nlast found the courage to leave his mountains and seek the Ring\nhimself. That was Gollum, the fate which Frodo would share himself,\nif the Ring were not destroyed.",
      "Only they had no way to destroy the Ring.",
      "The Shadow had foreseen every move they could make. Had\nalmost - Frodo still could not imagine how it had been\ndone, how the Shadow had arranged such a thing - had\nalmost maneuvered the Council into sending the Ring\nstraight into Mordor with only a tiny guard set on it, as they\nwould have done if Frodo and Bilbo had not been there.",
      "And having foregone that swiftest of all possible defeats, the\nonly question remaining was how long it would take to lose. Gandalf\nhad delayed too long, delayed far too long to set this march in\nmotion. It could have been so easy, if only Bilbo had set out\neighty years earlier, if only Bilbo had been told what Gandalf had\nalready suspected, if only Gandalf's heart had not silently\nflinched away from the prospect of being embarrassingly\nwrong...",
      "Frodo's hand spasmed on his breast; without thought, his fingers\nbegan to rise again toward the vast weight of the chain on which\nthe Ring hung.",
      "All he had to do was put on the Ring.",

If you once tell a lie, the truth is ever\nafter your enemy; and there's a lot of people out there telling\nlies -\" Harry's voice stopped.",
      "\"What does that have to do with Fawkes?\" she said.",
      "Harry withdrew his spoon from his cereal, and pointed in the\ndirection of the Head Table. \"The Headmaster has a phoenix, right?\nAnd he's Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot? So he's got political\nopponents, like Lucius. Now, d'you think that opposition is going\nto just roll over and surrender, because Dumbledore has a phoenix\nand they don't? Do you think they'll admit that Fawkes is even\nevidence that Dumbledore's a good person? Of course not.\nThey've got to invent something to say that makes\nFawkes... not important. Like, phoenixes only follow\npeople who charge straight at anyone they think is evil, so having\na phoenix just means you're an idiot or a dangerous fanatic. Or,\nphoenixes just follow people who are pure Gryffindor, so Gryffindor\nthey don't have the virtues of other Houses. Or it just shows how\nmuch courage a magical animal thinks you have, nothing else, and it\nwouldn't be fair to judge politicians based on that. They have to\nsay something to deny the phoenix. I bet Lucius didn't\neven have to make up anything new. I bet it had all been said\nbefore, centuries ago, since the first time someone had a phoenix\nriding on his shoulder, and someone else wanted people not to take\nthat into account as evidence. I bet by the time Fawkes came along\nit was already common wisdom, it would have just seemed\nstrange to take into account who a phoenix liked or\ndisliked. It would be like a Muggle newspaper testing political\ncandidates to rate their level of scientific literacy. Every force\nfor Good that exists in this universe, there's someone else who\nbenefits from people discounting it, or fencing it into a narrow\nbox where it can't get to them.\"",
      "\"But -\" Hermione said. \"Okay, I see why Lucius Malfoy doesn't\nwant anyone to think that Fawkes matters, but why does anyone who\nisn't a bad guy believe it?\"",
      "Harry Potter gave a little shrug. His spoon dropped back into\nhis cereal, and went on stirring without a pause. \"Why does any\nkind of cynicism appeal to people? Because it seems like a mark of\nmaturity, of sophistication, like you've seen everything and know\nbetter. Or because putting something down feels like pushing\nyourself up. Or they don't have a phoenix themselves, so their\npolitical instinct tells them there's no advantage to be gained\nfrom saying nice things about phoenixes. Or because being cynical\nfeels like knowing a secret truth that common people don't know...\"\nHarry Potter looked in the direction of the Head Table, and his\nvoice dropped until it was almost a whisper. \"I think maybe that's\nwhat he's getting wrong - that he's cynical about\neverything else, but not about cynicism itself.\"",
      "Without thinking, Hermione looked in the direction of the Head\nTable herself, but the Defense Professor's seat was still empty, as\nit had been on Monday and Tuesday; the Deputy Headmistress had\npronounced, earlier, that Professor Quirrell's classes for today\nwould be canceled.",
      "Afterward, when Harry had eaten a few bites of treacle tart and\nthen left the table, Hermione looked at Anthony and Padma, who had\nbeen coincidentally eating nearby but certainly not eavesdropping\nor anything.",
      "Anthony and Padma looked back at her.",
      "Padma said hesitantly, \"Is it just me, or has Harry Potter\nstarted talking like a more complicated sort of book in\nthe last few days? I mean, I haven't been listening to him very\nlong -\"",
      "\"It's not just you,\" said Anthony.",
      "Hermione didn't say anything, but she was becoming increasingly\nworried. Whatever had happened to Harry Potter on the day of the\nphoenix, it had changed him; there was something new in him now.\nNot cold, but hard. Sometimes she caught him staring out a\nwindow at nothing visible, a look of grim determination on his\nface. In Herbology class on Monday, a Venus Fire Trap had gone out\nof control; and Harry had tackled Terry out of the way of a\nfireball even as Professor Sprout had shouted a Flame-Freezing\nCharm; and when Harry had risen from the floor he'd just gone back\nto his place like nothing interesting had happened. And when for\nonce she'd gotten a better test score than Harry in their\nTransfiguration exam, later that same Monday, Harry had smiled at\nher as though to congratulate her, instead of gritting his teeth;\nand... that had bothered her a lot.",
      "She was getting the sense that Harry...",
      "...was pulling away from her...",
      "\"He seems a lot older all of a sudden,\" said Anthony.\n\"Not like a real grownup, I can't imagine Harry as a\ngrownup, but it's like he suddenly turned into a fourth-year\nversion of... of whatever he is.\"",
      "\"Well,\" Padma said. She daintily dabbed a chocolate-flavored\nscone with some scone-flavored frosting. \"I think Dragon and\nSunshine had better ally during the next battle or Mr. Harry Potter\nis going to smash us. We were allied last time, and even\nthen Chaos almost won -\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Anthony. \"You're right, Miss Patil. Tell the Dragon\nGeneral that we want to meet with you -\"",
      "\"No!\" said Hermione. \"We shouldn't have to gang up on\nGeneral Potter just to stand a chance. That doesn't make sense,\nespecially now that nobody can use Muggle things anymore. It's\nstill twenty-four soldiers in every army.\"",
      "Neither Padma or Anthony said anything to that.",
      "Knock-knock, knock-knock.",
      "\"Come in, Mr. Potter,\" she said.",
      "The door creaked open, and Harry Potter slipped through the\nopening into her office; he pushed the door shut behind him with\none hand, and wordlessly seated himself in the cushioned chair that\nnow stood in front of her desk. She'd Transfigured that chair so\noften that it sometimes changed form to reflect her mood, without\nany wand movement or incantation or even conscious intent. Right\nnow, that chair had become deeply cushioned, so that as Harry sat\ndown he sank into it, as though the chair were hugging him.",
      "Harry didn't seem to notice. There was an air of quiet\ndetermination about the boy; his eyes had locked steadily with\nhers, and not let up for a moment. \"You called me?\" said the\nboy.",
      "\"I did,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"I have two pieces of good\nnews for you, Mr. Potter. First - have you met Mr. Rubeus Hagrid,\nat all? The groundskeeper? He was an old friend of your\nparents.\"",
      "Harry hesitated. Then, \"Mr. Hagrid spoke to me a bit after I got\nhere,\" Harry said. \"I think it was on Tuesday of my first week of\nschool. He didn't say he knew my parents, though. At the time I\nthought he just wanted to introduce himself to the Boy-Who-Lived...\ndid he have some kind of hidden agenda? He didn't seem\nlike the type...\"",
      "\"Ah...\" she said. It took her a moment to pull her thoughts\ntogether. \"It's a long story, Mr. Potter, but Mr. Hagrid was\nfalsely accused of murdering a student, five decades ago. Mr.\nHagrid's wand was snapped, and he was expelled. Later, when\nProfessor Dumbledore became Headmaster, he gave Mr. Hagrid a place\nhere as Keeper of Grounds and Keys.\"",
      "Harry's eyes watched her intently. \"You said that five decades\nago was the last time a student died in Hogwarts, and you were\ncertain that five decades ago was the last time someone heard the\nSorting Hat's secret message.\"",
      "She felt a slight chill - even the Headmaster or Severus might\nnot have made that connection that quickly - and said, \"Yes, Mr.\nPotter. Someone opened the Chamber of Secrets, but this was not\nbelieved, and Mr. Hagrid was blamed for the resulting death.\nHowever, the Headmaster has located the additional enchantment on\nthe Sorting Hat, and he has shown it to a special panel of the\nWizengamot. As a result, Mr. Hagrid's sentence has been revoked -\njust this morning, in fact - and he will be allowed to acquire a\nnew wand.\" She hesitated. \"We... have not yet told Mr. Hagrid of\nthis, Mr. Potter. We were waiting until the deed was done, so as\nnot to give him false hope after so long. Mr. Potter... we were\nwondering if we could tell Mr. Hagrid that it was you who helped\nhim...?\"",
      "She saw the weighing look in his eyes -",
      "\"I remember Mr. Hagrid holding you when you were a baby,\" she\nsaid. \"I think he would be very happy to know.\"",
      "She could see it, though, on Harry's face, the moment when he\ndecided that Rubeus wouldn't be any use to him.",
      "Harry shook his head. \"Bad enough that someone might deduce\nthere was a Parselmouth in this year's crop of students,\" Harry\nsaid. \"I think it'd be more prudent to just keep it all as secret\nas possible.\"",
      "She remembered James and Lily, who'd never hesitated to return\nthe friendship the huge, bluff man had offered them, for all that\nJames was the scion of a wealthy House or Lily a budding Charms\nMistress, and Rubeus a mere half-giant whose wand had been\nsnapped...",
      "\"Because you don't expect him to prove useful, Mr. Potter?\"",
      "There was silence. She hadn't intended to say that out loud.",
      "Sadness crossed Harry's face. \"Probably,\" Harry said quietly.\n\"But I don't think he and I would get along, do you?\"",
      "Something seemed to be stuck in her throat.",
      "\"Speaking of making use of people,\" Harry said. \"It seems I'm\ngoing to be thrown into a war with a Dark Lord sometime soon. So\nwhile I'm in your office, I'd like to ask that my sleep cycle be\nextended to thirty hours per day. Neville Longbottom wants to start\npracticing dueling, there's an older Hufflepuff who offered to\nteach him, and they invited me to join. Plus there's other things I\nwant to learn too - and if you or the Headmaster think I should\nstudy anything in particular, in order to become a powerful wizard\nwhen I grow up, let me know. Please direct Madam Pomfrey to\nadminister the appropriate potion, or whatever it is that she needs\nto do -\"",
      "\"Mr. Potter!\u202f\"",
      "Harry's eyes gazed directly into her own. \"Yes, Minerva? I know\nit wasn't your idea, but I'd like to survive the use the\nHeadmaster's making of me. Please don't be an obstacle to\nthat.\"",
      "It almost broke her. \"Harry,\" she whispered in a bare voice,\n\"children shouldn't have to think like that!\"",
      "\"You're right, they shouldn't,\" Harry said. \"A lot of\nchildren have to grow up too early, though, not just me; and most\nchildren like that would probably trade places with me in five\nseconds. I'm not going to pity myself, Professor McGonagall, not\nwhen there are people out there in real trouble and I'm not one of\nthem.\"",
      "She swallowed, hard, and said, \"Mr. Potter, at thirty hours per\nday, you'll - get older, you'll age faster -\" Like\nAlbus.",
      "\"And in my fifth year I'll be around the same physiological age\nas Hermione,\" said Harry. \"Doesn't seem that terrible.\"\nThere was a wry smile now on Harry's face. \"Honestly, I'd probably\nwant this even if there weren't a Dark Lord. Wizards live\nfor a while, and either wizards or Muggles will probably push that\nout even further over the next century. There's no reason\nnot to pack as many hours into a day as I can. I've got\nthings I plan to do, and 'twere well they were done quickly.\"",
      "There was a long pause.",
      "\"All right,\" Minerva said. It came out as almost a whisper. She\nraised her voice. \"All right, Mr. Potter, I shall ask the\nHeadmaster, and if he agrees, it shall be done.\"",
      "Harry's eyes narrowed for a moment. \"I see. Then please remind\nthe Headmaster that Godric Gryffindor, in his last words, said that\nif it had been the right thing for him to do, then he wouldn't tell\nanyone else to choose wrongly, not even the youngest student in\nHogwarts.\"",
      "And she knew with a hollow feeling that any chance of Albus\nstopping this, stopping any of this, had just Vanished into\nnothingness. That was what Albus had told her when she'd objected\nthat Cameron Edward was too young, and then when she'd objected\nthat Peter Pevensie was too young, and finally she'd given up\nobjecting. \"Who told you that, Mr. Potter?\" Not Albus - surely\nAlbus would never say that to any student -",
      "\"I've been doing a lot of reading lately,\" Harry said. His body\nstarted to rise from the enveloping chair, then halted. \"Dare I ask\nabout the second piece of good news?\"",
      "\"Oh,\" she said. \"Ah - Professor Quirrell has woken up and says\nthat you may -\"",
      "The Hogwarts infirmary was a brilliantly open space, skylit on\nall four sides despite seeming to be located squarely in the middle\nof the castle. White beds in long rows stretched out, only three of\nthem occupied at the moment. One older boy and one older girl on\nopposite sides, both lying motionless with their eyes closed,\nprobably unconscious and spell-bound while some healing Charm or\nPotion reconfigured their bodies in uncomfortable ways; and the\nthird occupant had the curtain drawn around their bed, which was\npresumably a good thing. Madam Pomfrey had pushed him along with a\nhard shove and told him not to gawk, and Harry had needed to remind\nhimself sharply that some people still didn't know who the\nBoy-Who-Lived was - either that, or Madam Pomfrey's identity was\nbound up with her absolute dominance of her own hospital, etcetera,\nwhatever.",
      "Behind the rows of beds were five doors, leading into the\nprivate rooms where they stored the patients who would be staying\nfor days instead of hours, but whose condition didn't warrant a\ntransfer to St. Mungos.",
      "Windowless, skyless, unlit but for a single smokeless torch on\none of the solid stone walls; that was the room behind the middle\ndoor. Harry had wondered whether professors could ask Hogwarts to\nchange itself; or if the infirmary always had a room like that\navailable, for people who didn't enjoy the light.",
      "In the center of the room, between two equal bedstands that\nlooked to have been carved from the same grey marble as the walls,\nrested a white hospital bed, looking vaguely orangish in the\nunsmoking torchlight; and within that bed, a white sheet pulled up\nabout his thighs and wearing a hospital gown, sat Professor\nQuirrell with his back slightly propped up against the headboard of\nthe bed.",
      "There was something frightening about seeing Professor Quirrell\nin one of Madam Pomfrey's beds, even if the Defense Professor\nappeared uninjured. Even knowing that Professor Quirrell had\ndeliberately arranged his own apparent defeat at Severus's hands,\nto give himself an excuse to recover his strength from Azkaban.\nHarry had never actually watched anyone dying in a\nhospital bed, but he'd seen too many movies. It was an intimation\nof mortality, and the Defense Professor was not supposed\nto be mortal.",
      "Madam Pomfrey had told Harry that he was absolutely forbidden to\npester her patient.",
      "Harry had said, \"I understand\", which technically did not say\nanything about obedience.",
      "The stern old healer had then turned, and started to say to\nProfessor Quirrell that he was absolutely not to overexert himself\nor... upset himself...",
      "Madam Pomfrey had trailed off, hurriedly turned around, and fled\nthe room.",
      "\"Not bad,\" Harry observed, after the door had shut behind the\nescaping medical matron. \"I've got to learn how to do that,\nsometime.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell smiled a smile with absolutely no humor\ncontent, and said, his voice sounding a good deal dryer than its\nusual dryness, \"Thank you for your artistic critique, Mr.\nPotter.\"",
      "Harry stared into the pale blue eyes, and thought that Professor\nQuirrell looked...",
      "...older.",
      "It was subtle, it might have just been Harry's imagination, it\nmight have been the poor lighting. But the hair above Quirinus\nQuirrell's forehead might have receded a bit, what remained might\nhave thinned and greyed, an advancing of the baldness that had\nalready been visible on the back of his head. The face might have\ngrown a little sunken.",
      "The pale blue eyes had stayed sharp and intense.",
      "\"I am glad,\" Harry said quietly, \"to see you in what appears to\nbe good health.\"",
      "\"Appearances can be deceiving, of course,\" said Professor\nQuirrell. He gave a flick of his fingers, and when his hand\nfinished the gesture he was holding his wand. \"Would you believe\nthat woman thinks she has confiscated this from me?\"",
      "Six incantations the Defense Professor spoke then; six of the\nthirty that he had used to safeguard their important conversations\nin Mary's Room.",
      "Harry raised his eyebrows, silently quizzical.",
      "\"That is all I can manage for now,\" said the Defense Professor.\n\"I expect it shall prove sufficient. Still, there is a proverb: If\nyou do not wish a thing heard, do not say it. Consider it to apply\nin full measure. I am told that you were trying to see me?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry said. He paused, gathered his thoughts. \"Did the\nHeadmaster, or anyone, tell you that we can't go to lunch any\nmore?\"",
      "\"Something along those lines,\" said the Defense Professor. And\nwithout changing expression, \"Of course I was terribly sorry to\nhear it.\"",
      "\"It's more extreme than that, actually,\" said Harry. \"I'm\nconfined to Hogwarts and its grounds indefinitely. I can't leave\nwithout a guard and a good reason. I'm not going home for summer,\nand maybe not ever again. I was hoping... to speak with you, about\nthat.\"",
      "There was a pause.",
      "The Defense Professor exhaled a breath like a brief sigh, and\nsaid, \"We shall just have to rely on the known fact that the Deputy\nHeadmistress will personally murder anyone who tries to report me.\nMr. Potter, I intend to keep this conversation on track so that we\nmay conclude it quickly, is that understood?\"",
      "Harry nodded, and -",
      "In the light of the single torch, shaded toward the reddish end\nof the optical spectrum, the snake's green scales were not very\nreflective, and the blue-and-white banding hardly more so. Dark\nseemed the snake, in that light. The eyes, which had seemed like\ngray pits before, now reflected the torchlight, and seemed brighter\nthan the rest of the snake.",
      "\"Sso,\" hissed the venomous creature. \"What did you\nwissh to ssay?\u202f\"",
      "And Harry hissed, \"Sschoolmasster thinkss that woman'ss\nformer Lord iss the one who sstole her from prisson.\"",
      "Harry had thought about it this time, and carefully,\nbefore he had decided that he would reveal to Professor Quirrell\nonly that the Headmaster believed that; and not\nsay anything about the prophecy which had set Voldemort on Harry's\nparents, nor that the Headmaster was reconstituting the Order of\nthe Phoenix... it was a risk, a significant risk, but Harry needed\nan ally in this.",
      "\"He believess that one iss alive?\u202f\" the snake finally\nsaid. The divided, two-pronged tongue flickered rapidly from side\nto side, sardonic snakish laughter. \"Ssomehow I am not\nssurprissed.\"",
      "\"Yess,\" Harry hissed dryly, \"very amussing, I am\nssure. Except now am sstuck in Hogwartss for next ssix years, for\nssafety! I have decided that I will, indeed, sseek power; and\nconfinement iss not helpful for that. Musst convince sschoolmasster\nthat Dark Lord iss not yet awakened, that esscape was work of ssome\nother power -\"",
      "Again the rapid flickering of the snake's tongue; the snakish\nlaughter was stronger, dryer, this time. \"Amateur\nfoolisshnesss.\"",
      "\"Pardon?\u202f\" hissed Harry.",
      "\"You ssee misstake, think of undoing, ssetting time back to\nsstart. Yet not even with hourglasss can time be undone. Musst move\nforward insstead. You think of convincing otherss they are\nmisstaken. Far eassier to convince them they are right. Sso\nconssider, boy: what new happensstance would make schoolmasster\ndecide you were ssafe once more, ssimultaneoussly advance your\nother agendass?\"",
      "Harry stared at the snake, puzzled. His mind tried to comprehend\nand unravel the riddle -",
      "\"Iss it not obviouss?\u202f\" hissed the snake. Again the\ntongue flickered sardonic laughter. \"To free yoursself, to gain\npower in Britain, you musst again be sseen to defeat the Dark\nLord.\"",
      "In reddish-orange flickering torchlight, a green snake swayed\nabove a white hospital bed, as the boy stared into the embers of\nits eyes.",
      "\"Sso,\" Harry said finally. \"Let uss be clear on\nwhat iss propossed. You ssuggesst that we sset up imposstor to\nimperssonate Dark Lord.\"",
      "\"Ssomething like that. Woman we resscued will\ncooperate, sshould be mosst convincing when sshe iss sseen at hiss\nsside.\" More sardonic tongue-flickering. \"You are\nkidnapped from Hogwartss to public location, many witnesssess,\nwardss keep out protectorss. Dark Lord announcess that he hass at\nlong lasst regained physical form, after wandering as sspirit for\nyearss; ssayss that he hass gained sstill greater power, not even\nyou can sstop him now. Offerss to let you duel. You casst guardian\nCharm, Dark Lord laughss at you, ssayss he iss not life-eater.\nCasstss Killing Cursse at you, you block, watcherss ssee Dark Lord\nexplode -\"",
      "\"Casst Killing Cursse?\u202f\" Harry hissed in incredulity.\n\"At me? Again? Ssecond time? Nobody will believe Dark Lord\ncould posssibly be that sstupid -\"",
      "\"You and I are only two people in country who would notice\nthat,\" hissed the snake. \"Trusst me on thiss,\nboy.\"",
      "\"What if there iss third, ssomeday?\u202f\"",
      "The snake swayed thoughtfully. \"Could write different\nsscript for play, if you wissh. Whatever sscenario, sshould leave\nopen posssibility Dark Lord might return yet again - nation musst\nthink they are sstill dependent on you to protect them.\"",
      "Harry stared into the red-flickering pits of the snake's\neyes.",
      "\"Well?\u202f\" hissed the swaying form.",
      "The obvious thought was that going along with the Defense\nProfessor's plots and deceptions a second time, spinning\nan even more complicated lie to cover up the first\nmistake, and creating another fatal vulnerability if\nanyone ever discovered the truth, would be exactly the\nsame sort of stupidity as the putative Dark Lord using the Killing\nCurse again. It didn't even take his Hufflepuff side to point that\nout, Harry thought it in his very own mental voice.",
      "But there was also a certain question as to whether the\nappropriate moral to learn from the last experience was to always\nsay no immediately to the Defense Professor, or...",
      "\"Will think about it,\" hissed Harry. \"Will not\nansswer right away, thiss time, will enumerate risskss and\nbenefitss firsst -\"",
      "\"Undersstood,\" hissed the snake. \"But remember\nthiss, boy, other eventss proceed without you. Hessitation iss\nalwayss eassy, rarely usseful.\"",
      "The boy emerged from the private room into the main infirmary,\nrunning nervous fingers through his messy black hair as he walked\npast the white beds, occupied and unoccupied.",
      "Shortly afterward, the boy emerged from the Hogwarts infirmary\nentirely, passing Madam Pomfrey on the way out with a distracted\nnod.",
      "The boy walked out into a hallway, then into a larger corridor,\nand then stopped and leaned against the wall.",
      "The thing was...",
      "...he really didn't want to be stuck in Hogwarts for\nthe next six years; and when you thought about it...",
      "... the Incident with Rescuing Bellatrix From Azkaban wasn't\njust imposing costs on Harry. Other people would be\nworrying, living in fear of the Dark Lord's return, expending\nunknown resources to take unknown precautions. Harry could demand\nthat they write the script in such fashion as to make it seem\nnot plausible that the Dark Lord would return a third\ntime. And then people would relax, it would all be over.",
      "Unless of course there actually was a Dark Lord out\nthere to be feared. There had been a prophecy.",
      "The boy leaning against the wall vented a soft sigh, and started\nwalking again.",
      "Harry had almost forgotten, but he had gotten around to\nshowing Professor Quirrell the deck of cards he'd been given on\nSunday night by 'Santa Claus', within which the King of Hearts was\nallegedly a portkey that would take him to the Salem Witches'\nInstitute in America. Although of course Harry hadn't told\nProfessor Quirrell who'd sent him the card, nor what it\nwas supposed to do, before he'd asked Professor Quirrell\nif it was possible to tell where the portkey would send him.",
      "The Defense Professor had transformed back to human form, and\nexamined the King of Hearts, tapping it a few times with his\nwand.",
      "And according to Professor Quirrell...",
      "...the portkey would send the user somewhere in London, but he\ncouldn't pinpoint it any nearer than that.",
      "Harry had shown Professor Quirrell the note that had accompanied\nthe deck of cards, saying nothing of the earlier notes.",
      "Professor Quirrell had taken it in at a glance, given a dry\nchuckle, and observed that if you read the note carefully,\nit did not explicitly say that the portkey would take him\nto the Salem Witches' Institute.",
      "You needed to learn to pay attention to that kind of subtlety,\nProfessor Quirrell said, if you wanted to be a powerful wizard when\nyou grew up; or, indeed, if you wanted to grow up at all.",
      "The boy sighed again as he trudged off to class.",
      "He was starting to wonder if all the other wizarding schools\nwere also like this, or if it was only Hogwarts that had a\nproblem."

      "So the Defense Professor had told him; and while you could\nquibble about the details of the proverb, Harry understood the\nweaknesses of Ravenclaws well enough to know that you had to try\nanswering your own quibbles. Did some plans call for\nwaiting? Yes, many plans called for delayed action; but\nthat was not the same as hesitating to choose.\nNot delaying because you knew the right moment to do what was\nnecessary, but delaying because you couldn't make up your mind -\nthere was no cunning plan which called for that.",
      "Did you sometimes need more information to choose? Yes, but that\ncould also turn into an excuse for delaying; and it would be\ntempting to delay, when you were faced with a choice\nbetween two painful alternatives, and not choosing would\navoid the mental pain for a time. So you would pick a piece of\ninformation you couldn't easily obtain, and claim that you couldn't\npossibly decide without it; that would be your excuse. Although if\nyou knew what information you needed, knew when\nand how you would obtain that information, and knew what\nyou would do depending on each possible observation, then\nthat was less suspicious as an excuse for hesitating.",
      "If you weren't just hesitating, you ought to be able to\nchoose in advance what you would do, once you had the\nextra information you claimed you needed.",
      "If the Dark Lord were really out there, would it be\nsmart to go along with Professor Quirrell's plan to have someone\nimpersonate the Dark Lord?",
      "No. Definitely no. Absolutely not.",
      "And if Harry knew for a fact that the Dark Lord\nwasn't really out there... in that case...",
      "The Defense Professor's office was a small room, at least today;\nit had changed since the last time Harry had seen it, the stone of\nthe room becoming darker, more polished. Behind the Defense\nProfessor's desk stood the single empty bookcase that always\ndecorated the room, a tall bookcase stretching almost from the\nfloor to the ceiling, with seven empty wooden shelves. Harry had\nonly once seen Professor Quirrell take a book from those empty\nshelves, and never seen him put a book back.",
      "The green snake swayed above the seat of the chair behind the\nDefense Professor's desk, the lidless eyes staring unblinking at\nHarry from close to his own eye level.",
      "They were warded now by twenty-two spells, all that could be\ncast within Hogwarts without attracting the Headmaster's\nattention.",
      "\"No,\" hissed Harry.",
      "The green snake cocked its head, tilting it slightly; no emotion\nwas conveyed by the gesture, not that Harry's Parselmouth talent\nconveyed to him. \"Reasson not?\u202f\" said the green snake.",
      "\"Too rissky,\" Harry said simply. That was true whether\nor not the Dark Lord was out there. Forcing himself to decide in\nadvance had made him realize that he'd just been using the\nunanswered question as an excuse to hesitate; the sane decision was\nthe same, either way.",
      "For a moment the dark pitted eyes seemed to gleam blackly, for a\nmoment the scaled mouth gaped to expose the fangs. \"Think you\nhave learned wrong lessson, boy, from previouss failure. My planss\nare not in habit of failing, and lasst one would have gone\nflawlesssly, but for your own foolisshnesss. Correct lessson iss to\nfollow ssteps laid down for you by older and wisser Sslytherin,\ntame your wild impulssess.\"",
      "\"Lessson I learned is not to try plotss that would make\ngirl-child friend think I am evil or boy-child friend think I am\nsstupid,\" Harry snapped back. He'd been planning a more\ntemporizing response than that, but somehow the words had just\nslipped out.",
      "The sssss-ing sound that came from the snake was not\nheard by Harry as words, only as pure fury. A moment later,\n\"You told them -\"",
      "\"Of coursse not! But know what they would ssay.\"",
      "There was a long pause as the snake-head swayed, staring at\nHarry; again no detectable emotion came through, and Harry wondered\nwhat Professor Quirrell could be thinking that would take Professor\nQuirrell that long to think.",
      "\"You sserioussly care what thosse two think?\u202f\" came the\nsnake's final hiss. \"True younglingss thosse two are, not like\nyou. Could not weigh adult matterss.\"",
      "\"Might have done better than me,\" Harry hissed.\n\"Boy-child friend would have assked after ssecret motivess\nbefore asssenting to resscue woman -\"",
      "\"Glad you undersstand that now,\" the snake hissed\ncoldly. \"Alwayss assk after other'ss advantage. Next learn to\nalwayss assk after your own. If my plan iss not to your tasste,\nwhat iss yours?\u202f\"",
      "\"If necesssary - sstay at sschool ssix yearss and sstudy.\nHogwartss sseemss fine place to dwell. Bookss, friendss, sstrange\nbut tassty food.\" Harry wanted to chuckle, but there wasn't\nany gesture in Parseltongue for the kind of laughter he wanted to\nexpress.",
      "The pits of the snake's eyes seemed almost black. \"Eassy to\nssay that now. Ssuch as you and I, we do not tolerate\nimprissonment. You will losse patience long before sseventh year,\nperhapss before end of thiss one. I sshall plan\naccordingly.\"",
      "And before Harry could hiss another word of Parseltongue, the\nhuman-shape of Professor Quirrell was sitting in his chair once\nmore. \"So, Mr. Potter,\" said the Defense Professor, his voice as\ncalm as if they had been discussing nothing important, as if the\nwhole conversation had not occurred at all, \"I hear that you have\nbegun to practice dueling. Not the worthless sort with\nrules, I hope?\"",
      "Hannah Abbott looked as unnerved as Hermione had ever seen her\n(except on the day of the phoenix, the day Bellatrix Black had\nescaped, which shouldn't ought to count for anyone). The Hufflepuff\ngirl had come over to the Ravenclaw table during dinner, and tapped\nHermione on her shoulder, and very nearly dragged her away -",
      "\"Neville and Harry Potter are learning dueling from Mr.\nDiggory!\" Hannah blurted as soon as they were a few steps away from\nthe table.",
      "\"Who?\" said Hermione.",
      "\"Cedric Diggory!\u202f\" said Hannah. \"He's the Captain of\nour Quidditch Team, and general of an army, and he's taking\nall the electives and getting better grades than anyone,\nand I hear he learns dueling from professional tutors during the\nsummers, and he once beat two seventh-year students, and\neven some teachers call him the Super Hufflepuff, and Professor\nSprout says we should all emu, uh, emudate him or something like\nthat, and -\"",
      "After Hannah finally stopped for air (the list had gone on for a\nwhile), Hermione managed to insert a word in edgewise.",
      "\"Sunshine Soldier Abbott!\" said Hermione. \"Calm down.\nWe're not going to be fighting General Diggory, right? Sure,\nNeville's studying to beat us, but we can study too -\"",
      "\"Don't you see?\u202f\" Hannah shrieked, raising her voice a\nlot louder than it should've been, if they were trying to keep the\nconversation private from all the Ravenclaws looking at them.\n\"Neville isn't studying to beat us! He's practicing so he\ncan fight Bellatrix Black! They're going to go through us\nlike a Bludger through a stack of pancakes!\"",
      "The Sunshine General gave her soldier a look. \"Listen,\" said\nHermione, \"I don't think a few weeks of practice is going to make\nanyone an invincible fighter. Plus we already know how to\nhandle invincible fighters. We'll concentrate fire on them and\nthey'll go down just like Draco.\"",
      "The Hufflepuff girl was looking at her with mixed admiration and\nskepticism. \"Aren't you even, you know, worried?\u202f\"",
      "\"Oh, honestly!\u202f\" said Hermione. Sometimes it was hard\nbeing the only sensible person in your whole school year. \"Haven't\nyou ever heard the saying, the only thing we have to fear is fear\nitself?\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" said Hannah. \"That's crazy, what about\nLethifolds lurking in the darkness, and being put under the\nImperius Curse, and horrible Transfiguration accidents and -\"",
      "\"I mean,\" said Hermione, exasperation leaking out into\nher now-raised voice, she'd been hearing this sort of thing all\nweek now, \"how about if we wait until after the Chaos\nLegion actually crushes us to get so scared of them and\ndid you just mutter 'Gryffindors' under your voice?\u202f\"",
      "A few moments later, Hermione was walking back to her place at\nthe table with a sweet smile plastered onto her young face, it\nwasn't the terrible cold glare of Harry's dark side but it was the\nscariest face she knew how to make.",
      "Harry Potter was going down.",
      "\"This is loony,\" gasped Neville, with what tiny amount of breath\nhe could spare from being completely out of breath.",
      "\"This is brilliant!\u202f\" said Cedric Diggory. The eyes of\nthe Super Hufflepuff gleamed with manic enthusiasm, shining like\nthe sweat on his forehead as he stamped his feet through the dance\nof one of his dueling postures. His usually-light steps had changed\nto heavier stomps, which might have had something to do with the\nTransfigured metal weights they'd all attached to their arms and\nlegs and strapped over their chests. \"Where do you get\nthese ideas, Mr. Potter?\"",
      "\"A strange old shop... in Oxford... and I'm never... shopping\nthere... again.\" Thud."

      "In the high reaches of Hogwarts where rooms and corridors\nchanged on a daily basis, where the territory itself was uncertain\nand not just the map, where the stability of the castle began to\nfray into dreams and chaos without changing its architectural style\nor apparent solidity - in the high reaches of Hogwarts, a battle\nwould soon be fought.",
      "The presence of so many students would stabilize the corridors\nfor a time, by dint of constant observation. The rooms and\ncorridors of Hogwarts sometimes moved even while people\nlooked directly at them, but they wouldn't change. Even\nafter eight centuries, Hogwarts was still a little shy about\nchanging in front of people.",
      "But despite that transient permanence (the Defense Professor had\nsaid) the upper reaches of Hogwarts still had a military realism:\nyou had to learn the ground anew each time, and check every closet\nfor secret corridors all over again.",
      "Sunday it was, Sunday the first of March. Professor Quirrell had\nrecovered enough to supervise battles once more, and they were all\ncatching up on the backlog.",
      "The Dragon General, Draco Malfoy, watched two compasses he held\nin either hand. One compass was the color of the Sun, the other had\na multicolored, iridescent sheen to indicate Chaos. The other two\ngenerals, Draco knew, had been given their own compasses; only\nHermione Granger's hand, and Harry Potter's hand, would hold a\ncompass that was orange-red and flickered in its reflections like\nfire, pointing always to the direction of the largest active\ncontingent of Dragon Army.",
      "Without those compasses they might have searched for days and\nnever found each other, which was a territorial hazard of fighting\nin the upper levels of Hogwarts.",
      "Draco had a bad feeling about what would happen when Dragon Army\nfound the Chaos Legion. Harry Potter had changed since Bellatrix\nBlack had escaped; the Heir of Slytherin had begun to seem truly\nLordly now (and how had Professor Quirrell known that would\nhappen?) Draco would have felt a lot better with Hermione Granger\nstanding alongside him with her twenty-three Sunshine Soldiers in\ntow, but no, the Sunshine General was being stupidly proud and\nrefusing to accept aid against General Potter. She wanted to take\ndown Potter herself, she'd told him.",
      "The Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy had maintained their\ninfluence over Britain for centuries by understanding that you\ncouldn't always be the most powerful. Sometimes another\nLord was just stronger, and you had to settle for merely\nbeing his foremost lieutenant. You could build up quite a\nposition of wealth and power over a dozen generations of being\nsecond in command. You just had to be careful, each time, not to\nlet your House be dragged down with the fall of the Lord you\nserved. That was the Malfoy tradition which centuries of experience\nhad honed...",
      "And so Father had thoroughly explained to Draco that if he ran\ninto someone who was obviously stronger than him, Draco was\nnot to resent this and not to deny it and\nnot to throw a tantrum that could sabotage his potential\nposition, but Draco was to make sure that his place in the\nnext generation's power structure wasn't any lower than second.",
      "Granger, apparently, had never gotten this lecture from her own\nparents, and was still in denial about the obvious fact that Harry\nPotter was becoming stronger than her.",
      "So Draco had secretly met with Captain Goldstein and Captain\nBones and Captain Macmillan and they'd agreed to all do their best\nto make sure that Dragon and Sunshine didn't engage each other\nbefore they engaged the larger threat of Chaos.",
      "It wasn't really violating the agreement against\ntraitors, you weren't soliciting traitors if you honestly meant to\nhelp the other army.",
      "A high ringing tone belled through the corridors to signal the\nstart of the battle, and a moment later Draco shouted\n\"Go!\u202f\" and the Dragons started running. It would tire his\nsoldiers, it would cost them something even after they stopped and\ncaught their breath, but they had to put Chaos directly\nbetween themselves and the Sunshine Regiment.",
      "Harry and Neville walked at a leisurely pace through the\ncorridors, Harry watching the yellow-golden compass that pointed\ntoward the location of the Sunshine Regiment, and Neville keeping a\nlookout just in case they ran into someone else.",
      "Their footsteps sounded a bit thumpy, if you listened\nclosely.",
      "\"So,\" the Chaotic Lieutenant said after a while. \"That's why you\nhad us practice dueling with all that weight strapped on?\"",
      "Harry nodded, keeping his eyes on the compass that led to\nSunshine; if the apparent direction started to change quickly then\nthey were getting close.",
      "\"I didn't want to say anything in front of the others, but a\ncouple of weeks isn't a lot of time to put on extra muscle,\" said\nNeville. \"And the balance is different, and I think this weighs\nmore actually, and doesn't this count as Transfiguring a\nMuggle artifact?\"",
      "\"Nope,\" Harry said. \"I checked that in advance. You can see it\nin Hogwarts statues, so some wizards used to wear it, even\nif they were just being fashionable for the Dark Ages.\" And since\nnobody would ever try this if they weren't fighting\nfirst-year students using weak spells like the Sleep Hex, it didn't\ncount as giving away good ideas, either.",
      "They came to a Y-intersection, an annoying one; neither corridor\nbent in quite the right way to take them on a direct intercept\ncourse toward where Sunshine would go as they followed the Chaos\nLegion following Dragon Army. So Harry chose what seemed like the\nbetter of the two options, and Neville followed.",
      "\"We'd better try a quick Silencing Charm on this stuff when we\nget close,\" Neville said. \"It's kind of noisy, they might figure it\nout.\"",
      "Harry nodded, and then said \"Good idea\" in case Neville hadn't\nbeen looking at him.",
      "They trudged on through the stone-floored corridor of the upper\nreach of Hogwarts, lit by windows of plain glass or stained glass,\nnow and then passing statues of witches and dragons and even the\noccasional wizard-knight in plate armor or chainmail.",
      "The Sunshine Soldiers were striding through a long, wide\ncorridor with their wands out and pointed. They couldn't use the\nPrismatic Shield while they were maneuvering, but Parvati Patil and\nJenny Rustad were currently maintaining Contegos around\nthe officer group, who would be the first targets of any\nambush.",
      "Their tactic for the next battle, she and her officers had\ndecided, would be to mix directly in with the enemy soldiers as\nfast as possible - after having practiced among themselves\nhow to support one another, avoid hitting each other, and get into\npositions where enemy soldiers would hesitate to fire. They'd only\ngotten in four hours practice, but she thought her troops would\nalready be better at that kind of mixed-in fighting than soldiers\nwho hadn't practiced at all. It seemed like the sort of tactic\nChaos would use, but they hadn't actually used it yet.",
      "It was a good strategy, she believed. And yet still, no matter\nhow much she'd lectured her soldiers, they'd persisted in\nwhispering fearful rumors about what Harry and Neville were\nlearning to do. Finally she'd gone off and talked with Captain\nGoldstein, who understood things like Troop Morale, and Anthony had\nsuggested -",
      "\"That's weird,\" Captain Macmillan spoke up suddenly, frowning at\nthe fiery and iridescent compasses he held in either hand. (Ernie\nwas, as Harry would have termed it, \"good at spatial\nvisualization\", and so had been designated to hold both compasses\nand try to figure out what their enemies were doing.) \"I think...\nDragon's not moving fast anymore... I think they got on the other\nside of Chaos from us first... and it looks like Chaos is moving to\nattack them instead of trying to maneuver out from in between?\"",
      "Hermione frowned, trying to understand, and she saw similar\nfrowns on the faces of Anthony and Ron. If Chaos and Dragon\nattacked each other straight out, and spent all their forces\nfighting each other, that was practically conceding the battle to\nSunshine...",
      "\"Potter thinks we're allied so he's attacking Malfoy now, before\nDragon can link up with us,\" said Blaise Zabini from the common\nranks of soldiers. \"Or Potter just thinks he can beat both armies\nin a row, if he attacks them separately.\" The Slytherin boy gave a\ncondescending sigh. \"Are you going to promote me back to officer\nnow? You lot are hopeless without me, you know.\"",
      "They all ignored the talking noises coming from Zabini's\nmouth.",
      "\"We still moving in the right direction?\" said Anthony.",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Ernie.",
      "\"We getting close to them?\" said Ron.",
      "\"Not yet -\"",
      "That was when the huge black-wooden doors at the end of the\ncorridor flew open and crashed into the wall, revealing two figures\nalmost completely enveloped in grey cloaks, grey cloth stretched\nover the faces beneath the grey hoods, one of those figures already\nraising a wand and pointing it directly at her.",
      "And then the face of the game changed drastically, as Harry's\nvoice, high and strained with the effort, screamed the word:",
      "\"Stupefy!\u202f\"",
      "The dueling-grade stunner blasted toward her, she was so shocked\nthat she didn't start to move until almost too late, as the red jet\nof light smashed right through the Contego shield\nto their front and she just barely dodged, there was a tingle on\nher arm as the red light went past her, and she saw out of the\ncorner of her eye Susan getting hit and blown off her feet into Ron\n-",
      "\"Somnium!\u202f\" bellowed Anthony's voice, followed a moment\nlater by a dozen voices crying \"Somnium!\u202f\"",
      "Hermione frantically pushed herself to her feet, and as she\nrose, she saw the two figures in the grey cloaks just standing\nthere.",
      "You couldn't see Sleep Hexes, the spell was too weak\n-",
      "But there was no way they all could've missed.",
      "\"Stupefy!\u202f\" shrieked the voice of Neville Longbottom,\nand another red jet shot at her, she fell in an undignified heap as\nshe desperately twisted out of the way, and when she scrambled up,\npanting, she saw that this time the stunbolt had gotten Ron where\nhe'd been rising from the ground.",
      "\"Hello there, Sunshine,\" said Harry's voice from beneath his\nhood.",
      "\"We're the Grey Knights of Chaos,\" said Neville's voice.",
      "\"We'll be your opponents for this battle,\" said Harry's voice,\n\"while Chaos's other army slaughters the Dragons.\"",
      "\"And by the way,\" said Neville's voice, \"we're invincible.\"",
      "The two boys in their grey cloaks and robes, grey cloth over\ntheir faces, stood facing Sunshine's entire army, seemingly unfazed\nby a dozen Sleep Hexes.",
      "Daphne heard a soft sigh from beside her, and when her head\nturned she saw that Hannah's lips were parted, and the Hufflepuff\ngirl's eyes were huge, and she was staring at -",
      "It would have been hard to describe the jumble of thoughts that\nflashed through Daphne's mind as she realized that Hannah was\nstaring at Neville rather than Harry, which in turn seemed to\ntrigger some part of her into noticing that in point of fact\nNeville had been getting pretty interesting lately as boys\nwent, in fact right now the Last Scion of Longbottom was seeming\ndownright cool, and something woke up inside her and her\nown lips parted and everything the Lady her Mother had ever\ninstructed her about demure demeanors and flattery and scented\nshampoo blew straight out of her mind so hard it should have\nfluffed her hair about her ears, because she'd watched Hermione and\nHarry and she knew how she wanted her own courtship to go\n-",
      "Her Lady Mother had also recently instructed her on a few spells\nit might be embarrassing not to know if you belonged to the Noble\nand Most Ancient House of Greengrass.",
      "Daphne's wand swung to point to her left, and she shouted\n\"Tonare!\u202f\"",
      "The wand went over her head, and she spoke the incantation\n\"Ravum Calvaria!\u202f\"",
      "And finally she grasped her wand in both hands and shrieked,\n\"Lucis Gladius!\u202f\"",
      "The huge magical drain almost sent her to her knees, but she\nbore it, and when the blazing shape had fully formed and stabilized\nthe drain was a little less.",
      "Still, she had a feeling she'd better not try to fight with this\nfor long.",
      "That everyone was staring at her went quite without\nsaying, and she should have leaped forward to confront\nNeville with her hair billowing around her, but it was all she\ncould do to walk forward steadily to level her Most Ancient Blade\nat Neville Longbottom. That everyone moved aside and made way for\nher also went without saying.",
      "\"I hight Daphne, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of\nGreengrass!\u202f\" she cried. \"Greengrass of Sunshine!\u202f\"\nThe dueling forms had gone completely out of her mind, she'd seen\nenough plays to remember death challenges and blood challenges but\nshe couldn't remember at all what was appropriate for this, so she\njust pointed the incandescent sword toward the object of her crush\nand yelled, \"Let's see what you got, Nevvy!\u202f\"",
      "Once again Harry's voice shrieked \"Stupefy!\u202f\", and\nlater on, when she was remembering this, she could never quite\nbelieve she'd managed to do it, but she slashed out with her blade\nof light like it was a Beater's bat, and hit the stunbolt back\nat Harry who just barely managed to twist out of the way.",
      "\"Tonare!\u202f\" shouted Neville, of the Noble and Most\nAncient House of Longbottom. \"Ravum Calvaria, Lucis\nGladius!\u202f\"",
      "For a few seconds, no one did anything but stare at Neville and\nDaphne as they started whacking at each other. They were both\nmoving slowly, and Hermione guessed that the spell was taking a lot\nof strength out of them. It wasn't very impressive by comparison,\nif you were a Muggleborn and you'd watched certain movies.",
      "But you still had to give them extra credit for using\nlightsabers at all.",
      "\"Point of order,\" said Harry's voice. \"I know the Defense\nProfessor is watching, but I still have to ask, does anyone know\nwhether they'll slice each other in half if they actually hit\n-\"",
      "\"No,\" Hermione said absently. This had been in one of her\nhistory books, though she'd had no idea the magical dueling sword\nlooked like that. \"They cast it so it'll only stun if it\ntouches.\"",
      "\"You know that spell?\"",
      "\"Oh, no, it's the Charm of the Most Ancient Blade, it's only\nlegal for Noble and Most Ancient Houses to use -\"",
      "Hermione stopped talking and looked at Harry, or Harry's grey\nhood rather.",
      "\"Well,\" said Harry's voice, \"I guess I could take down the rest\nof the Sunshine Regiment by myself, then.\" She couldn't see his\nface, but his voice sounded like he was smiling.",
      "\"You dodged when Daphne hit your own spell back at you,\"\nHermione said. \"So whatever you did, you're not\ninvincible. A Stupefy can still get you.\"",
      "\"Interesting theory,\" said Harry's voice from beneath the hood.\n\"Got anyone in your army who can test it?\"",
      "\"I read about the Stunning Hex once,\" said Hermione. \"A few\nmonths ago. I wonder if I can remember the instructions right?\" Her\nwand came up to point at Harry.",
      "There was a slight pause, as nearby a boy and a girl breathing\nin audible gasps slowly whacked at each other with lightsabers.",
      "\"Of course,\" Harry said, leveling his own wand on her,\n\"I can just use Somnium on you. That'll take a lot less\neffort.\"",
      "New Contego shields sprung into existence in front of\nher, cast by Jenny and Parvati, even as Harry spoke.",
      "The tip of Hermione's own wand began making small motions in the\nair, a diamond within a circle, a diamond within a circle,\nrehearsing the gesture to match exactly what she remembered seeing\nin the book. It would be a difficult feat even for her, but she\nhad to cast the spell right on the first try, she couldn't\nafford any failed castings that would sap her energy.",
      "\"You know,\" said Hermione Granger, \"I understand that it's not\nreally your fault, but I'm getting tired of hearing people talk\nabout the Boy-Who-Lived like you're - like you're some kind of\ngod or something.\"",
      "\"Same here, I must say,\" said Harry Potter. \"It's sad how people\nkeep underestimating me.\"",
      "Her wand kept rehearsing the diamond within the circle, over and\nover. Harry would be recharging his own strength, she knew, even as\nshe practiced as much as she could before her attack. \"I'm starting\nto think you need taking down a peg, General Chaos.\"",
      "\"You could be right,\" Harry said equably. His feet began to\nshuffle through what she recognized as a duelist's dance.\n\"Unfortunately there's nothing left that can defeat me now except\nanother Harry Potter.\"",
      "\"Let me be specific, Mr. Potter. I'm taking you down a\npeg.\"",
      "\"You and what other army?\"",
      "\"You think you're pretty cool, don't you,\" said Hermione.",
      "\"Why, yes,\" said Harry. \"Yes, I do. Some might call that\narrogant, but am I supposed to be the last person in Hogwarts to\nnotice how awesome I am?\"",
      "Hermione raised her left hand into the air, and made a fist.",
      "It was a signal. Eight designated soldiers in her army would be\npointing their wands at her, and quietly casting Wingardium\nLeviosa.",
      "They'd practiced this, too, once Hermione had given up\non lecturing her soldiers, and at Anthony's suggestion, tried\ngiving them a Sunshine General who looked like she could\ndefeat invincible enemies.",
      "\"You pretend you're Superman,\" said Hermione. She raised her\nleft fist higher in the air, and the eight soldiers supporting her\nHovered her off the ground. \"Well here's Super Hermione!\u202f\"\nHer hand pushed forward, and as she shot rapidly through the air\ntoward Harry, regretting only that she couldn't see the look on his\nface, her wand made a diamond within a circle and she summoned up\nall the magic she could, it felt like she imagined touching a live\nwire would feel as the too-powerful spell poured through her when\nher voice screamed \"Stupefy!\u202f\"",
      "The red bolt burst from her wand, perfectly formed.",
      "Harry dodged it.",
      "And then, because they hadn't practiced doing this part inside\nof hallways, she crashed into a wall.",
      "\"Somnium!\u202f\" shrieked Draco, and then after only a few\nseconds to recharge, \"SOMNIUM, CURSE YOU!\u202f\"",
      "He knew he was hitting Theodore, the other boy wasn't\neven trying to dodge, but the scion of Nott only grinned as evilly\nas his father and leveled his wand -",
      "Draco managed to leap aside just as Theodore said\n\"Somnium!\u202f\" but Draco was getting winded, he couldn't keep\nthis up, Theodore wasn't bothering to dodge at all while Draco had\nto keep moving, this was crazy.",
      "He had enough strength now to fire again, but -",
      "Stupidity is doing the same thing and expecting a different\nresult, Harry had said, this was Harry's work\nsomehow, it couldn't be a Muggle artifact anymore but Draco\ncouldn't figure out what it could be, and he should be\nthinking of hypotheses and ways to test them but he was too busy\nfrantically dodging as Theodore laughed and shot another Sleep Hex\nat him, Draco felt a little numbness in his side that time as he\ntwisted, that had been a very very near miss and finally Draco\ncouldn't take it anymore, he didn't bother working out what theory\nhe was testing or why as he just -",
      "\"Luminos!\u202f\" shouted Draco, and Theodore was haloed in\nred light, \"Dulak!\u202f\" and it went out again (so Theodore\nwas still being affected by magic),\n\"Expelliarmus!\u202f\" and Theodore's wand went flying (that had\nbeen a good spell to cast anyway now that Draco realized it) but\nTheodore was rushing toward Draco with his arms outstretched to\ngrapple so Draco yelled \"Flipendo!\u202f\" and the other boy's\nfeet were abruptly yanked up -",
      "- and Theodore's back hit the ground with a surprisingly loud\nand metallic-sounding crash.",
      "Draco's vision was swimming now from casting four spells in such\nfast succession, and Theodore was already scrambling to his feet,\nso there wasn't even time to think in words, but Draco still\nmanaged to say \"Somnium!\u202f\" and this time he aimed\nfor Theodore's face instead of the chest.",
      "Theodore dodged (he dodged!) and the boy shouted\n\"Code seven on Malfoy!\u202f\"",
      "\"Prismatis!\u202f\" cried Padma's voice and there was\nsuddenly a shimmering rainbow wall in front of Draco, just as four\nChaotic voices cried \"Somnium!\u202f\"",
      "And there was a pause, as everyone looked at the huge Prismatic\nSphere protecting the remnants of Dragon Army.",
      "Casting that fifth spell had sent Draco to his hands and knees,\nbut he looked up and managed to say, as clearly as he could, \"If\nthe Sleep Hex - doesn't work - aim for the face - I think the\nLieutenants are wearing metal shirts.\"",
      "\"You've already lost too many soldiers,\" Finnigan said loudly\nfrom across the barrier, \"we'll beat you anyway,\" and then the\nGryffindor boy laughed evilly. He did the evil laughter almost as\nwell as Harry Potter by now, and the other Chaotic Legionnaires\nstarted laughing with him soon afterward.",
      "Draco could see from the corner of his eye where Gregory and\nVincent lay unconscious. Padma was still sustaining the Prismatic\nSphere, the largest one he'd ever seen her cast; but she was\nbreathing hard, still visibly sweaty from when they'd all jogged to\nget into position, the Ravenclaw girl was a strong witch but not an\nathletic one.",
      "He really hoped General Granger got here soon and hit Chaos from\nbehind. General Potter and Neville of Chaos were missing, and Draco\ncould guess where they'd gone, but two soldiers couldn't delay the\nwhole Sunshine Regiment for too long all by themselves, could\nthey?",
      "She knew it wasn't fair, that the other girl had given all she\ncould, but Hermione still wished that Daphne had lasted longer.",
      "\"Lagann!\u202f\" said Neville's voice from behind her as she\nflew, and there was the sound of a Prismatic Wall shattering,\nHannah's voice desperately cried \"Somnium!\u202f\" and then a\nfew moments later Neville's voice calmly said \"Somnium\" and there\nwas the thud of another of her soldiers falling over.",
      "And the force keeping her in the air diminished again, Hermione\ncould feel the grab of the Hover Charms straining at her, but now\nit just wasn't enough.",
      "Her flight stopped and she began falling in slow motion toward\nthe ground, and she should've signaled her soldiers to just\ndrop her, but she was too angry and confused and not\nthinking fast enough and still trying to muster the strength for\none last Stunning Hex, and so there was nowhere to go when Harry\npointed his wand at her and said \"Somnium\" and that was\nthe last word that Hermione Granger heard of her battle."

      "Hermione wasn't feeling very nice right now, or Good either,\nthere was a hot ball of anger burning inside her and she wondered\nif this was something like Harry's darkness (though it probably\nwasn't even close) and she shouldn't have felt that way over some\nsilly little game but -",
      "Her whole army. Two soldiers had beaten her whole army. That was\nwhat she'd been told after she woke up.",
      "It was a little too much.",
      "\"Well,\" Professor Quirrell said. From up close the Defense\nProfessor didn't look quite as healthy as he had the last time\nshe'd been in his office; his skin looked paler, and he moved a\nlittle slower. His expression was as stern as ever, and his gaze as\npenetrating; his fingers tapped sharply on his desk, rap-rap. \"I\nwould guess that of the three of you, only Mr. Malfoy has guessed\nwhy I've asked you here.\"",
      "\"Something to do with Noble and Most Ancient Houses?\" said Harry\nfrom beside her, sounding puzzled. \"I didn't violate some kind of\ncrazy law by firing on Daphne, did I?\"",
      "\"Not quite,\" the man said with heavy irony. \"Since Miss\nGreengrass did not invoke the correct dueling forms, she is not\nentitled to demand that you be stripped of your House name.\nAlthough of course I would not have permitted a formal duel. Wars\ndo not respect such rules.\" The Defense Professor leaned forward\nand rested his chin on steepled hands, as though sitting upright\nhad already tired him. His eyes gazed at them, sharp and dangerous.\n\"General Malfoy. Why did I call you here?\"",
      "\"General Potter against the two of us isn't a fair fight\nanymore,\" Draco Malfoy said in a quiet voice.",
      "\"What?\u202f\" blurted Hermione. \"We almost had\nthem, if Daphne hadn't fainted -\"",
      "\"Miss Greengrass did not faint from magical exhaustion,\"\nProfessor Quirrell said dryly. \"Mr. Potter shot her in the back\nwith a Sleep Hex while your soldiers were distracted by the sight\nof their general flying into a wall. But congratulations\nnonetheless, Miss Granger, on almost defeating two Chaotic\nLegionnaires with a mere twenty-four Sunshine Soldiers.\"",
      "The blood flaming in her cheeks grew a little hotter. \"That -\nthat was just - if I'd only figured out he was wearing armor -\"",
      "Professor Quirrell gazed at her from over touched fingers. \"Of\ncourse there are ways you could have won, Miss Granger.\nThere always are, in every lost battle. The world around us redunds\nwith opportunities, explodes with opportunities, which nearly all\nfolk ignore because it would require them to violate a habit of\nthought; in every battle a thousand Hufflepuff bones waiting to be\nsharpened into spears. If you had thought to try a massed\nFinite Incantatem on general principles, you would have\ndispelled Mr. Potter's suit of chainmail and everything else he was\nwearing except his underwear, which leads me to suspect that Mr.\nPotter did not quite realize his own vulnerability. Or you could\nhave had your soldiers swarm Mr. Potter and Mr. Longbottom and\nphysically wrest the wands from their hands. Mr. Malfoy's own\nresponse was not what I would term well-reasoned, but at\nleast he did not wholly ignore his thousand alternatives.\" A\nsardonic smile. \"But you, Miss Granger, had the misfortune to\nremember how to cast the Stunning Hex, and so you did not search\nyour excellent memory for a dozen easier spells that might have\nproved efficacious. And you pinned all your army's hopes on your\nown person, so they lost spirit when you fell. Afterward they\ncontinued to cast their futile Sleep Hexes, governed by the habits\nof fighting that had been trained into them, unable to break the\npattern as Mr. Malfoy did. I cannot quite comprehend what goes\nthrough people's minds when they repeat the same failed strategy\nover and over, but apparently it is an astonishingly rare\nrealization that you can try something else. And so the Sunshine\nRegiment was wiped out by two soldiers.\" The Defense Professor\ngrinned mirthlessly. \"One perceives certain similarities to how\nfifty Death Eaters dominated all of magical Britain, and how our\nmuch-loved Ministry continues in its rule.\"",
      "The Defense Professor sighed. \"Nonetheless, Miss\nGranger, the fact remains that this is not the first such defeat\nfor you. In the previous battle, you and Mr. Malfoy united your\nforces, and yet you were fought to a standstill, so that you and\nMr. Malfoy had to pursue Mr. Potter onto the roof. The Chaos Legion\nhas now demonstrated, twice in succession, military strength equal\nto both other armies combined. This leaves me no choice. General\nPotter, you will select eight soldiers from your army, including at\nleast one Chaotic Lieutenant, to be divided among Dragon Army and\nthe Sunshine Regiment -\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" Hermione burst out again, she glanced over at\nthe other generals and saw that Harry looked as shocked as her,\nwhile Draco Malfoy only looked resigned.",
      "\"General Potter is stronger than both of you together,\"\nProfessor Quirrell said with calm precision. \"Your contest is over,\nhe has won, and it is time to rebalance the three armies to present\nhim with a renewed challenge.\"",
      "\"Professor Quirrell!\u202f\" said Harry. \"I didn't -\"",
      "\"This is my decision as the Professor of Battle Magic at the\nHogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and it is not subject to\nnegotiation.\" The words were still precise, but the look in\nProfessor Quirrell's eyes chilled Hermione's blood, even though he\nwas glaring at Harry and not at her. \"And I find it\nsuspicious, Mr. Potter, that the moment you wished to\nisolate Miss Granger and Mr. Malfoy and force them to chase you\nonto the roof, you were able to annihilate just exactly as much of\ntheir united force as you pleased. Indeed, that is the level of\nperformance I expected of you since the start of this\nyear, and I am annoyed to discover that you have been\nholding back in my classes this entire time! I have seen what you\ncan truly do, Mr. Potter. You are far beyond the point where Mr.\nMalfoy or Miss Granger can fight you on an equal level, and you\nwill not be permitted to pretend otherwise. This, Mr. Potter, I\ntell you in my capacity as your professor: For you to learn to your\nfull potential, you must exercise your full abilities and not hold\nback for any reason - particularly not childish frets over\nwhat your friends might think!\"",
      "She left the Defense Professor's office with a larger army, and\nless dignity, and feeling a lot like a sad little bug that had just\nbeen squished, and trying very very hard not to cry.",
      "\"I wasn't holding back!\" Harry said as soon as they\nturned the first corner away from Professor Quirrell's office, the\nmoment the wooden door faded out of sight behind the stone walls.\n\"I wasn't pretending, I never let either of you win!\"",
      "She didn't answer, couldn't answer, it would all break loose if\nshe tried to say a word.",
      "\"Really?\" said Draco Malfoy. The Dragon General still had that\nair of resignation. \"Because Quirrell's right, you know, it's\nsuspicious that you could beat nearly everyone in both our\narmies as soon as you wanted to make us chase you onto the roof.\nAnd didn't you say something then, Potter, about us needing to beat\nyou when you were fighting for real?\"",
      "The burning sensation was creeping up her throat, and when it\nreached her eyes she would burst into tears, and from then on she\nwould be just a crying little girl to both of them.",
      "\"That -\" Harry's voice said urgently, she wasn't looking at him\nbut his voice sounded like he had his head turned toward her. \"That\nwas - I tried a lot harder that time, there was an important\nreason, I had to, so I used a whole bunch of tricks I'd\nbeen saving up - and -\"",
      "She'd always been trying her hardest, every time.",
      "\"- and I, I let out a side of myself I wouldn't usually use for\nsomething like Defense class -\"",
      "So if she ever got close to winning against Harry when it\nreally mattered, he could just go into his dark side and\ncrush her, was that it?",
      "...of course it was. She couldn't even look Harry in\nthe eyes when he was being scary, how had she ever thought she\ncould beat him for real?",
      "The corridor forked, and Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy went left\ntoward a staircase that climbed to the second floor, and she went\nright instead, she didn't even know where that passage went but\nright now she'd rather be lost in the castle.",
      "\"Excuse me, Draco,\" said Harry's voice, and then there was a\npattering of footsteps behind her.",
      "\"Leave me alone,\" she said, it came out sounding stern but then\nshe had to shut her mouth and press her lips together tightly and\nhold her breath to stop it all from coming out.",
      "That boy just kept on coming, and ran around her and put himself\nin front of her, because he was stupid that was why, and Harry\nsaid, his voice now a high and desperate whisper, \"I didn't run\naway when you were beating me in all my classes\nexcept broomstick riding!\"",
      "He didn't understand, and he would never understand, Harry\nPotter would never understand, because no matter what contest he\nlost he would still be the Boy-Who-Lived, if you were Harry Potter\nand Hermione Granger was beating you then it meant everyone was\nexpecting you to rise to the challenge, if you were Hermione\nGranger and Harry Potter was beating you that meant you were just\nno one.",
      "\"It's not fair,\" she said, her voice was shaking but she wasn't\ncrying yet, not yet, \"I shouldn't have to fight your dark\nside, I'm just - I'm only -\" I'm only twelve, that was\nwhat she thought then.",
      "\"I only used my dark side once and that was - when I\nhad to!\"",
      "\"So today you beat my whole army being just Harry?\" She\nstill wasn't crying yet, and she wondered what her face looked like\nright now, if she looked like an angry Hermione or a sad one.",
      "\"I -\" Harry said. His voice got a little lower, \"I wasn't...\nreally expecting to win, that time, I know I said I was\ninvincible but that was just to try to scare you, I really just\nthought we'd slow you down for a bit -\"",
      "She started walking again, walked right past him, and as she\npassed Harry's face tightened up like he was going to\ncry.",
      "\"Is Professor Quirrell right?\" came a high desperate whisper\nfrom behind her. \"If I have you for a friend, will I always be\nafraid to do better because I know it will hurt your feelings?\nThat's not fair, Hermione!\"",
      "She took a breath and held it and ran, her feet pattering across\nthe stone as fast as they could, running as fast as she dared with\nher vision all blurry, ran so that no one would hear her, and this\ntime Harry didn't follow.",
      "Minerva was going over the Transfiguration parchment due Monday,\nand had just marked down to negative two hundred points a\nfifth-year parchment with an error that could have potentially\nkilled someone. During her first year as a professor she'd been\nindignant at the folly of older students, now she was just\nresigned. Some people not only never learned, they never noticed\nthat they were hopeless, they stayed bright and eager and kept on\ntrying. Sometimes they believed you when you told them, before they\nleft Hogwarts, that they must never try anything unusual,\ngive up free Transfiguration and use the art only through\nestablished Charms; and sometimes... they didn't.",
      "She was in the middle of trying to unravel a particularly\nconvoluted answer when a knock at the door disrupted her thoughts;\nand it wasn't her office hours, but it had only taken a very short\ntime as Head of Gryffindor House for her to learn to suspend\njudgment. You could always deduct House points\nafterward.",
      "\"Come in,\" she said in a crisp voice.",
      "The young girl who entered her office had clearly been crying,\nand then afterward had washed her face in hopes it wouldn't show\n-",
      "\"Miss Granger!\" said Professor McGonagall. It had taken her a\nmoment to recognize that face with its eyes reddened and cheeks\npuffed. \"What happened?\"",
      "\"Professor,\" said the young girl in a wavering voice, \"you said\nthat if I was ever worried or uncomfortable about anything, I\nshould come to you at once -\"",
      "\"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall, \"now what\nhappened?\u202f\"",
      "The girl started to explain -",
      "Hermione stood still and the stairs turned around her, a\nrevolving helix that shouldn't have taken her anywhere at all, and\ninstead bore her continuously upward. Hermione thought it\nseemed like the Enchantment of the Endless Stair, which had been\ninvented in 1733 by the wizard Arram Sabeti who'd lived on top of\nMount Everest in the days when no Muggles could climb it. Only that\ncouldn't be right because Hogwarts was much older - maybe the\nenchantment had been reinvented?",
      "She should've been frightened, should've been nervous about her\nsecond meeting with the Headmaster.",
      "She was, in fact, frightened and nervous about her\nsecond meeting with the Headmaster.",
      "Only Hermione Granger had been thinking; she'd been thinking a\nlot, after she hadn't been able to run any further and had slid\ndown against the wall with her lungs on fire, thinking while she\ncurled up in a ball with her back against the chilly stone wall and\nher legs drawn up and crying.",
      "Even if she lost to Harry Potter she was never, ever going to\nlose to Draco Malfoy, that was just totally absolutely\nunacceptable, and Professor Quirrell had praised General Malfoy for\nnot ignoring his thousand alternatives; and so after Hermione had\ncried herself out she'd thought of fourteen other spells she\nshould've tried against Harry and Neville, and then she'd\nstarted wondering if she might be making the same sort of mistake\nabout other things; and that was how she'd ended up knocking on\nProfessor McGonagall's door. Not asking for help, right now\nHermione didn't have any plans she could ask for help\nwith, just telling Professor McGonagall everything,\nbecause when she'd thought of it that had seemed like one of the\nthousand alternatives that Professor Quirrell had been talking\nabout.",
      "And she'd told Professor McGonagall about how Harry Potter had\nchanged since the day the phoenix had been on his shoulder, and\nabout how people more and more seemed to see her as just something\nof Harry's, and how it seemed like Harry was pulling farther and\nfarther away from everyone else in their school year and went\naround with a sad air sometimes like he was losing something, and\nshe didn't know what to do anymore.",
      "And Professor McGonagall had told her that they needed to talk\nto the Headmaster.",
      "And Hermione had felt worried, but then the thought had come to\nher that Harry Potter wouldn't have been scared of the\nHeadmaster. Harry Potter would have just barged ahead doing\nwhatever he was trying to do. Maybe (the thought had come to her)\nit was worth trying to be like that, not being\nscared, just doing whatever, and seeing what happened to her, it\ncouldn't really be worse.",
      "The Endless Stair stopped turning.",
      "The great oaken door in front of them with the brass griffin\nknocker opened without being touched.",
      "Behind a black oaken desk with dozens of drawers facing in every\ndirection, looking like it had drawers set inside other\ndrawers, was the silver-bearded Headmaster of Hogwarts upon his\nthrone, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, into whose gently\ntwinkling eyes Hermione looked for around three seconds before she\nwas distracted by all the other things in the room.",
      "Some time later - she wasn't sure how long but it was while she\nwas trying to count the number of things in the room for the third\ntime and still not getting the same answer, even though\nher memory insisted that nothing had been added or removed - the\nHeadmaster cleared his throat and said, \"Miss Granger?\"",
      "Hermione's head snapped around, and she felt a little heat in\nher cheeks; but Dumbledore didn't appear annoyed with her at all,\nonly serene, and with an inquiring look in those mild, half-glassed\neyes.",
      "\"Hermione,\" said Professor McGonagall, the older witch's voice\nwas gentle and her hand rested reassuringly on Hermione's shoulder,\n\"please tell the Headmaster what you said to me about Harry.\"",
      "Hermione began speaking, despite her newfound resolution her\nvoice still stumbled a little with nervousness, as she described\nhow Harry had changed in the last few weeks since Fawkes had been\non his shoulder.",
      "When she was done there was a pause, and then the Headmaster\nsighed. \"I am sorry, Hermione Granger,\" said Dumbledore. Those blue\neyes had grown sadder as she spoke. \"That is... unfortunate, but I\ncannot say it is unexpected. That is a hero's burden, which you\nsee.\"",
      "\"A hero?\u202f\" said Hermione. She looked up nervously at\nProfessor McGonagall and saw that the Transfiguration Professor's\nface had grown tight, though her hand still squeezed Hermione's\nshoulder reassuringly.",
      "\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"I was a hero myself once, before I was\na mysterious old wizard, in the days when I opposed Grindelwald.\nYou have read history books, Miss Granger?\"",
      "Hermione nodded.",
      "\"Well,\" said Dumbledore, \"that is what heroes have to do, Miss\nGranger, they have their tasks and they must grow strong to\naccomplish them, and that is what you see happening to Harry. If\nthere is anything that can be done to gentle his pathway, then\nyou will be the one to do it, and not I. For I am not\nHarry's friend, alas, but only his mysterious old wizard.\"",
      "\"I -\" said Hermione. \"I'm not sure - I still want to be -\" Her\nvoice stopped, it seemed too awful to say aloud.",
      "Dumbledore closed his eyes, and when he opened them, he looked a\nlittle older than before. \"No one can stop you, Miss Granger, if\nyou choose to stop being Harry's friend. As for what it would do to\nhim, you may know that better than I.\"",
      "\"That - doesn't seem fair,\" Hermione said, her voice\ntrembling. \"That I've got to be Harry's friend because\nhe's got no one else? That doesn't seem fair.\"",
      "\"Being a friend is not something you can be forced to,\nMiss Granger.\" The blue eyes seemed to look right through her. \"The\nfeelings are there, or they are not. If they are there, you can\naccept them or deny them. You are Harry's friend - and\nchoosing to deny it would wound him terribly, perhaps beyond\nhealing. But Miss Granger, what would drive you to such\nextremes?\"",
      "She couldn't find words. She'd never been able to find words.\n\"If you get too near Harry - you get swallowed up, and no\none sees you any more, you're just something of\nhis, everyone thinks the whole world revolves around him\nand...\" She didn't have the words.",
      "The old wizard nodded slowly. \"It is indeed an unjust world we\nlive in, Miss Granger. All the world now knows that it is I who\ndefeated Grindelwald, and fewer remember Elizabeth Beckett who died\nopening the way so I could pass through. And yet she is remembered.\nHarry Potter is the hero of this play, Miss Granger; the\nworld does revolve around him. He is destined for great\nthings; and I ween that in time the name of Albus Dumbledore will\nbe remembered as Harry Potter's mysterious old wizard, more than\nfor anything else I have done. And perhaps the name of Hermione\nGranger will be remembered as his companion, if you prove worthy of\nit in your day. For this I tell you true: never will you find more\nglory on your own, than in Harry Potter's company.\"",
      "Hermione shook her head rapidly. \"But that's not -\"\nShe'd known she wouldn't be able to explain. \"It's not about\nglory, it's about being - something that belongs to\nsomeone else!\"",
      "\"So you think you would rather be the hero?\" The old wizard\nsighed. \"Miss Granger, I have been a hero, and a leader;\nand I would have been a thousand times happier if I could have\nbelonged to someone like Harry Potter. Someone made of sterner\nstuff than I, to make the hard decisions, and yet worthy to lead\nme. I thought, once, that I knew such a man, but I was mistaken...\nMiss Granger, you have no idea at all how fortunate are\nthose like you, compared to heroes.\"",
      "The hot burning feeling was creeping up her throat again, along\nwith helplessness, she didn't understand why Professor McGonagall\nhad brought her here if the Headmaster wasn't going to help, and\nfrom a glance at Professor McGonagall's face, it looked like\nProfessor McGonagall also wasn't sure now that it had been a good\nidea.",
      "\"I don't want to be a hero,\" said Hermione Granger, \"I don't\nwant to be a hero's companion, I just want to be me.\"",
      "(The thought came to her a few seconds later that maybe she\ndid in fact want to be a hero, but she decided not to\nchange what she'd said.)",
      "\"Ah,\" said the old wizard. \"That is a tall order, Miss Granger.\"\nDumbledore rose from his throne, stepped out behind his desk, and\npointed to a symbol on the wall, so ubiquitous that Hermione's eyes\nhad glossed right over it; a faded shield on which was inscribed\nthe heraldry of Hogwarts, the lion and snake, and badger and raven,\nand in Latin engraved words whose point she'd never understood.\nThen, as she realized where that shield was, and how old it looked,\nit suddenly occurred to Hermione that this might be the\noriginal -",
      "\"A Hufflepuff would say,\" said Dumbledore, tapping his finger on\nthe faded badger and making Hermione wince for the sacrilege (if it\nwas the original), \"that people fail to become who they\nare meant to be, because they are too lazy to put in all the work\ninvolved. A Ravenclaw,\" tapping the raven, \"would repeat those\nwords that the wise know to be far older than Socrates, know\nthyself, and say that people fail to become who they are meant\nto be, through ignorance and lack of thought. And Salazar\nSlytherin,\" Dumbledore frowned as his finger tapped the faded\nsnake, \"why, he said that we become who we are meant to be by\nfollowing our desires wherever they lead. Perhaps he would say that\npeople fail to become themselves because they refuse to do what is\nnecessary to achieve their ambitions. But then one notes that\nnearly all of the Dark Wizards to come out of Hogwarts have been\nSlytherins. Did they become what they were meant to be? I think\nnot.\" Dumbledore's finger tapped the lion, and then he turned\ntoward her. \"Tell me, Miss Granger, what would a Gryffindor say? I\ndo not need to ask whether the Sorting Hat offered you that\nHouse.\"",
      "It didn't seem like a hard question. \"A Gryffindor would say\nthat people don't become who they should be, because they're\nafraid.\"",
      "\"Most people are afraid, Miss Granger,\" said the old\nwizard. \"They live their whole lives circumscribed by crippling\nfear that cuts off everything they might accomplish, everything\nthey might become. Fear of saying or doing the wrong thing, fear of\nlosing their mere possessions, fear of death, and above all the\nfear of what other people will think of them. Such fear is a most\nterrible thing, Miss Granger, and it is terribly important to know\nthat. But it is not what Godric Gryffindor would have said. People\nbecome who they are meant to be, Miss Granger, by doing what is\nright.\" The old wizard's voice was gentle. \"So tell me, Miss\nGranger, what seems to you like the right choice? For\nthat is who you truly are, and wherever that path leads,\nthat is who you are meant to become.\"",
      "There was a long space filled with the sounds of things that\ncould not be counted.",
      "She thought about it, because she was a Ravenclaw.",
      "\"I don't think it's right,\" Hermione said slowly, \"for\nsomeone to have to live inside someone else's shadow like\nthat...\"",
      "\"Many things in the world are not right,\" said the old wizard,\n\"the question is what is right for you to do about them.\nHermione Granger, I shall be less subtle than is usual for a\nmysterious old wizard, and tell you outright that you cannot\nimagine how badly things could go if the events\nsurrounding Harry Potter turn to ill. His quest is a matter you\nwould not even dream of walking away from, if you\nknew.\"",
      "\"What quest?\" said Hermione. Her voice was trembling,\nbecause it was very clear what answer the Headmaster was looking\nfor and she didn't want to give it. \"What happened to\nHarry back then, why was Fawkes on his shoulder?\"",
      "\"He grew up,\" said the old wizard. His eyes blinked several\ntimes, beneath the half-moon glasses, and his face suddenly looked\nvery lined. \"You see, Miss Granger, people do not grow up because\nof time, people grow up when they are placed in grownup situations.\nThat is what happened to Harry Potter that Saturday. He was told -\nyou are not to share this information with anyone, you understand -\nhe was told that he would have to fight someone. I cannot tell you\nwho. I cannot tell you why. But that is what happened to him, and\nwhy he needs his friends.\"",
      "There was a pause.",
      "\"Bellatrix Black?\u202f\" Hermione said. She couldn't have\nbeen more shocked if someone had plugged an electrical cord into\nher ear. \"You're going to make Harry fight Bellatrix\nBlack?\u202f\"",
      "\"No,\" said the old wizard. \"Not her. I cannot tell you who, or\nwhy.\"",
      "She thought about it some more.",
      "\"Is there any way I can keep up with Harry?\" said\nHermione. \"I mean, I'm not saying it's what I'll do, but -\nif he needs friends then can we be equal friends? Can I be\na hero too?\"",
      "\"Ah,\" said the old wizard, and smiled. \"Only you can decide\nthat, Miss Granger.\"",
      "\"But you're not going to help me like you're helping Harry.\"",
      "The old wizard shook his head. \"I have helped him little enough,\nMiss Granger. And if you are asking me for a quest -\" The old\nwizard smiled again, rather wryly. \"Miss Granger, you are in your\nfirst year of Hogwarts. Do not be too eager to grow up; there will\nbe time enough for that later.\"",
      "\"I'm twelve. Harry's eleven.\"",
      "\"Harry Potter is special,\" said the old wizard. \"As you know,\nMiss Granger.\" The blue eyes were suddenly piercing beneath the\nhalf-moon glasses, and she was reminded of the day of the Dementor\nwhen Dumbledore's voice had said, inside her mind, that he knew\nabout Harry's dark side.",
      "Hermione put up her hand and touched Professor McGonagall's\nhand, which had stayed strong on her shoulder this whole time, and\nHermione said, she was surprised that her voice didn't break, \"I'd\nlike to go, now, please.\"",
      "\"Of course,\" said Professor McGonagall, and Hermione felt the\nhand on her shoulder gently turning her around to face the oaken\ndoor.",
      "\"Have you chosen your path yet, Hermione Granger?\" said Albus\nDumbledore's voice from behind her, even as the door slowly creaked\nopen to reveal the Enchantment of the Endless Stair.",
      "She nodded.",
      "\"And?\"",
      "\"I'll,\" she said, her voice stuck, \"I'll, I'll -\"",
      "She swallowed.",
      "\"I'll do - what's right -\"",
      "She didn't say anything else, she couldn't, and then the Endless\nStair began revolving around her once again.",
      "Neither she nor Professor McGonagall spoke on the way down.",
      "When the Flowing Stone gargoyles stepped out of their way, and\nthe two of them stepped out into the corridors of Hogwarts,\nProfessor McGonagall finally spoke, and she said in a whisper, \"I'm\nso terribly sorry, Miss Granger. I did not think the Headmaster\nwould say such things to you. I think he truly has forgotten what\nit is like to be a child.\"",
      "Hermione glanced back up to her and saw that Professor\nMcGonagall looked like she was about to burst into\ntears... only not really, but there was a tightness in her face\nthat was like that.",
      "\"If I want to be a hero too,\" said Hermione, \"if I've decided to\nbe a hero too, is there anything you can do to help?\"",
      "Professor McGonagall rapidly shook her head, and said, \"Miss\nGranger, I'm not sure the Headmaster is wrong about that.\nYou are twelve.\"",
      "\"Okay,\" said Hermione.",
      "They walked forward a bit.",
      "\"Excuse me,\" said Hermione, \"is it okay if I walk back to the\nRavenclaw tower by myself? I'm sorry, it's not your fault or\nanything, I just want to be by myself right now.\"",
      "\"Of course, Miss Granger,\" said Professor McGonagall, her voice\nsounding a little hoarse, and Hermione heard her footsteps stop,\nand then turn around behind her.",
      "Hermione Granger walked away.",
      "She climbed a flight of stairs, and then another, wondering if\nthere was anyone else in Hogwarts who would give her a chance to be\na hero. Professor Flitwick would say the same thing as Professor\nMcGonagall, and even if he didn't, he probably couldn't help,\nHermione didn't know who could help. Well, Professor\nQuirrell would come up with something clever if she used up enough\nQuirrell points, but she had a feeling that asking him would be a\nbad idea - that the Defense Professor couldn't help anyone become\nthe sort of hero that was worth becoming, and that he wouldn't even\nunderstand the difference.",

      "It was out of the corner of her eye that Hermione Granger saw\nit, a reflection on the polished metal of a statue at the junction\nof two corridors, a flash of gold, a flash of red, something like\nan image of fire; just for a moment she saw it, and then it was\ngone.",
      "She paused, puzzled, and she almost walked away, but\nthere had been something familiar about that brief glow -",
      "Hermione walked forward to where the statue had stood, looked at\nthe corridor from which she thought the fiery reflection might have\ncome.",
      "Faintly, as though from a faraway place, she heard the cry, the\ncall.",
      "Hermione started to run.",
      "She ran for a while; whenever she got to a junction she would\npause, catch as much breath as she could, and then she would see a\nflash of fire reflected from one direction or another, or hear that\ndistant call. If it hadn't been for her army training she would've\nfallen over in exhaustion, running like that.",
      "She never saw the phoenix.",
      "And then she came to a four-way branch and there was\nnothing, no sign, she waited for long seconds and she\nheard no cry and saw no fire, and she was only just starting to\nwonder with a sick sad feeling if she'd imagined the whole thing,\nwhen she heard a person cry out.",
      "When her rapidly racing feet turned the corner her mind took in\nthe whole scene at a glance, three huge boys in green-trimmed robes\nalready turning to look at her, and one shorter and smaller boy in\nyellow, who was dangling in the air from one foot held up high by\nan invisible hand.",
      "The Sunshine General didn't even think about it, people who\nstopped to think didn't spring very good ambushes.",
      "Her wand was in her hand, her fingers did the twist and her lips\nsaid \"Somnium!\u202f\" and the largest bully fell over, the\nHufflepuff boy dropped out of the air with a thump and the\nother two bullies were trying to aim their wands at her and she\nsaid \"Somnium!\u202f\" again and another huge boy keeled over -\nthe one who'd been aiming his wand faster, that was who she'd fired\nat.",
      "Unfortunately casting two Sleep Hexes in a row like that was\nhard even for her, and she couldn't get off a third before -",
      "The last bully shouted \"Protego!\u202f\" and was surrounded\nby a shimmering blue glow.",
      "Twenty-four hours ago, Hermione would have panicked at that, a\nreal Shielding Charm would let the bully-boy cast spells\non her even while he was protected.",
      "Now she -",
      "\"Stupefy!\u202f\" shouted the bully-boy.",
      "The crimson bolt blasted toward her with a terrible brilliance,\nblazing far brighter than any hex that had sprung from Harry's\nwand.",
      "Hermione swayed slightly to the left, and the bolt missed,\nbecause the bully's aim hadn't been nearly as good as\nHarry's; and the thought came to her that maybe bullies and\nProfessor Quirrell's armies didn't mix.",
      "\"Stupefy!\u202f\" shouted the bully-boy again.\n\"Expelliarmus! Stupefy!\u202f\"",
      "Anyway, now she'd just spent a whole hour thinking of\nall the other spells she could've cast on Harry and\nNeville -",
      "\"Jellyfy!\u202f\" yelled the bully-boy, a wide-beam jinx with\nno visible bolt to dodge, and her knees suddenly felt almost too\nweak to support her. And then, with an angry roar producing an even\nbrighter blaze of crimson, \"Stupefy!\u202f\"",
      "She dodged that one by deliberately falling, and by then she'd\nrecovered enough for her next spell, which was -",
      "\"Glisseo,\" said Hermione, directing her remark to the\nfloor.",
      "\"Oof,\" said the bully-boy as his feet went out from under him\nand he actually dropped his wand.",
      "The Protego winked out.",
      "\"Somnium,\" said Hermione.",
      "She was still breathing in gasps as she crawled over to where\nthe Hufflepuff boy was sitting up, and groaning and rubbing his\nskull where he'd been dropped head-first into the floor; it was a\ngood thing he hadn't been a Muggle, Hermione realized, or he might\nhave snapped his neck. She hadn't actually thought of that.",
      "\"Uh,\" said the boy, his hair was of a color that would've been\ncalled 'brunette' if he was a girl, his eyes an undistinguished\nbrown that somehow seemed just right for Hufflepuff, there weren't\nany tears on his face but he looked sort of pale. She pegged him at\nabout fourth year, or third.",
      "Then the brown eyes widened as he focused on her. \"General\nSunshine?\u202f\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" she said. \"That's (gasp) me.\" If the Hufflepuff\nboy said anything about her being Harry Potter's love interest, she\ndecided, he was going to die.",
      "\"Wow,\" said the Hufflepuff boy. \"That was - you just - I mean I\nsaw you on the screens before Christmas but - wow! I can't believe\nyou just did that!\"",
      "There was a pause.",
      "I can't believe I just did that, thought Hermione\nGranger, who was feeling a little faint all of a sudden, it must\nhave been all that running. \"Excuse (gasp) me,\" she said,\n\"can you (gasp) Unjellyfy my legs?\"",
      "The boy nodded, pushed himself to his feet, and reached inside\nhis robes for his wand; but Hermione had to correct his gesture\nbefore the counter-Jinx worked right.",
      "\"I'm Michael Hopkins,\" said the boy once Hermione had rolled\nback to her own feet. He stuck out his hand. \"Or just Mike inside\nHufflepuff, there aren't any other Mikes in all of Hufflepuff this\nyear, would you believe it?\"",
      "They shook hands, and Mike said, \"Anyway, thank\nyou.\"",
      "Hermione wasn't prepared for the rush of euphoria that hit her\nthen, saving someone like that literally felt better than anything\nshe'd ever felt in her whole life.",
      "She turned to look at the bullies.",
      "They were very big and they looked, she thought, around fifteen\nyears old, and she was suddenly realizing just how large a\ndifference had sprung up between Hogwarts students who'd signed up\nfor all of Professor Quirrell's extra-curricular activities, and\nstudents who'd had years of being taught by the worst Professors\never to go Professing. Being able to hit things that you\naimed at, for example; or being able to think well enough in the\nmiddle of a fight to realize that you ought to Innervate\nyour fallen allies. And other things Professor Quirrell had said,\nlike that in the real world almost any fight would be settled by a\nsurprise attack, suddenly made a lot more sense to her.",
      "Still trying to catch her breath, she looked back at Mike.",
      "\"Would you (gasp) believe,\" said Hermione Granger,\n\"that five minutes ago I was (gasp) having trouble\nfiguring out how to become a (gasp) hero?\"",
      "Had she really thought she needed permission from\nsomeone, or that heroes sat around waiting for someone else to give\nthem quests? It was very simple actually, you just went where the\nevil was, that was all it ever took to be a hero. She should've\nremembered, she shouldn't have needed a phoenix to tell her, that\nbad things sometimes happened right here in Hogwarts.",
      "Then Hermione glanced nervously back at where the three older\nboys were lying unconscious as the realization hit that they'd\nseen her, they might know who she was, they might\nsneak up on her and take her by surprise and - and they\ncould really hurt her -",
      "Hermione stopped.",
      "She remembered that Harry Potter had put himself in the middle\nof five Slytherin bullies on the first day of class when\nhe hadn't even known how to use his wand.",
      "She remembered the Headmaster saying that you grew up by being\nput in grownup situations, and that most people lived their lives\ninside a constraining circle of fear.",
      "And she remembered Professor McGonagall's voice saying, 'You\nare twelve.'",
      "Hermione took a deep breath, once, twice, and three times.",
      "She asked Mike if he needed to go to Madam Pomfrey's office,\nwhich he didn't; and got him to tell her the names of the Slytherin\nboys, just in case.",
      "And then Hermione Granger strolled away from the heap of\nunconscious bullies, making sure to put a smile on her face as she\nwalked.",
      "She knew that she was probably going to get hurt sooner or\nlater. But if you were too scared of getting hurt to do what was\nright, then you couldn't be a hero, it was as simple as that; and\nif you'd put the Sorting Hat on her head at that moment it wouldn't\nhave waited even one second before calling out\n'GRYFFINDOR!'",
      "She was still thinking about it when she came down to dinner;\nthe euphoria of saving someone still hadn't worn off, and she was\nbeginning to worry that it had broken something in her brain.",
      "As she approached the Ravenclaw table a sudden epidemic of\nwhispers broke out, and Hermione wondered if the Hufflepuff boy had\nsaid anything yet before she realized that the whispers probably\nweren't about that.",
      "She sat down across from Harry Potter who looked\nextremely nervous, probably because she was still\nsmiling.",
      "\"Uh -\" said Harry, as she served herself freshly toasted bread,\nbutter, cinnamon, no fruits or vegetables whatsoever, and three\nhelpings of chocolate brownies. \"Uh -\"",
      "She let him go on like that until she'd finished pouring herself\na glass of grapefruit juice, and then she said, \"I've got a\nquestion for you, Mr. Potter. How do you think people fail to\nbecome themselves?\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" said Harry.",
      "She looked at him. \"Pretend there isn't all this stuff going\non,\" she said, \"and just say whatever you'd have said\nyesterday.\"",
      "\"Um...\" Harry said, looking very confused and worried. \"I think\nwe already are ourselves... it's not like I'm an imperfect\ncopy of someone else. But I guess if I try to run with the sense of\nthe question, then I'd say that people don't become themselves\nbecause we absorb all this crazy stuff from the environment and\nthen regurgitate it. I mean, how many people playing Quidditch\nwould be playing a game like that if they'd invented the game\nthemselves? Or back in Muggle Britain, how many people who think of\nthemselves as Labour or Conservative or Liberal Democrat would\ninvent that exact bundle of political beliefs if they had to come\nup with everything themselves?\"",
      "Hermione considered this. She'd been wondering if Harry would\nsay something Slytherin or maybe even Gryffindor, but this didn't\nseem to fit into the Headmaster's list; and it occurred to Hermione\nthat there might be a lot more viewpoints on the subject than just\nfour.",
      "\"Okay,\" said Hermione, \"different question. What makes someone a\nhero?\"",
      "\"A hero?\u202f\" said Harry.",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Hermione.",
      "\"Ah...\" Harry said. His fork and knife nervously sawed at a\npiece of steak, cutting it into tinier and tinier pieces. \"I think\na lot of people can do things when the world channels them into\nit... like people are expecting you to do it, or it only uses\nskills you already know, or there's an authority watching to catch\nyour mistakes and make sure you do your part. But problems like\nthat are probably already being solved, you know, and then there's\nno need for heroes. So I think the people we call 'heroes' are rare\nbecause they've got to make everything up as they go along, and\nmost people aren't comfortable with that. Why do you ask?\" Harry's\nfork stabbed three pieces of thoroughly shredded steak and lifted\nthem up to his mouth.",
      "\"Oh, I just stunned three older Slytherin bullies and rescued a\nHufflepuff,\" said Hermione. \"I'm going to be a hero.\"",
      "When Harry had finished choking on his food (some of the other\nRavenclaws in hearing distance were still coughing) he said,\n\"What?\u202f\"",
      "Hermione told the story, it began rippling out in further\nwhispers even as she spoke. (Though she left out the part about the\nphoenix, because that seemed like a private thing between the two\nof them. Hermione had felt surprised, thinking about it afterward,\nthat a phoenix would appear for someone who wanted to be a\nhero; it seemed a bit selfish when she thought about it that way;\nbut maybe it didn't matter to phoenixes so long as they saw that\nyou were willing to help people.)",
      "When she was done talking, Harry stared at her across the table\nand didn't say a word.",
      "\"I'm sorry for how I acted earlier,\" Hermione said. She sipped\nfrom her glass of grapefruit juice. \"I should've remembered that if\nI'm still beating the pants off you in Charms class then it's okay\nfor you to do better in Defense.\"",
      "\"Please don't take this the wrong way,\" said Harry. He\nlooked too-adult now, and grim. \"But are you sure this is who\nyou are, and not, to put it bluntly, me?\"",
      "\"I'm quite certain,\" said Hermione. \"Why, my name practically\nspells out 'heroine' except for the extra 'm', I never noticed that\nuntil today.\"",
      "\"Being a hero isn't all fun and games,\" said Harry. \"Not real\nheroing, the sort grownups have to do, it isn't like this, it isn't\ngoing to be this easy.\"",
      "\"I know,\" said Hermione.",
      "\"It's hard and it's painful and you've got to make decisions\nwhere there isn't any good answer -\"",
      "\"Yes, Harry, I read those books too.\"",
      "\"No,\" said Harry, \"you don't understand, even if the books warn\nyou there's no way you can understand until -\"",
      "\"That doesn't stop you,\" said Hermione. \"It doesn't stop you\neven a little. I bet you never even considered not being a\nhero because of that. So why d'you think it'll stop me?\"",
      "There was a pause.",
      "A sudden huge smile lit Harry's face, a smile that was as bright\nand as boyish as the frown had been grim and adult, and everything\nwas all right again between them.",
      "\"This is going to go horribly mind-bogglingly wrong somehow,\"\nsaid Harry, still smiling hugely. \"You know that, right?\"",
      "\"Oh, I know,\" said Hermione. She ate another bite of toast.\n\"That reminds me, Dumbledore refused to be my mysterious old\nwizard, is there someplace I can write to get another one?\"",
      "Aftermath:",
      "\"...and Professor Flitwick says her determination seems\nunshakeable,\" Minerva said tightly, staring at the silver-bearded\nold wizard who was responsible for this. Albus Dumbledore was just\nsitting silently and listening to her with a distant sad look in\nhis eyes. \"Miss Granger didn't even blink when Professor Flitwick\nthreatened to have her transferred to Gryffindor, just said that if\nshe left she would take all the books with her. Hermione Granger\nhas decided she's going to be a hero and she's not taking no for an\nanswer. I doubt you could have pushed her into this any harder if\nyou had tried to -\"",
      "It took all of five full seconds for Minerva's brain to process\nthe realization.",
      "\"ALBUS!\" she shrieked.",
      "\"My dear,\" said the old wizard, \"after you have dealt with your\nthirtieth hero or so, you will realize that they react quite\npredictably to certain things; such as being told that they are too\nyoung, or that they are not destined to be heroes, or that being a\nhero is unpleasant; and if you truly wish to be sure you should\ntell them all three. Although,\" with a brief sigh, \"it does not do\nto be too blatant, or your Deputy Headmistress might catch\nyou.\"",
      "\"Albus,\" Minerva said, her voice even tighter, \"if she is hurt,\nI swear this time I'll -\"",
      "\"She would have come to that same place in due time,\" Albus\nsaid, the distant sad look still in his eyes. \"If someone is meant\nto become a hero then they will not listen to our warnings,\nMinerva, no matter how hard we try. And given that, it is better\nfor Harry if Miss Granger does not fall too far behind him.\" Albus\nproduced, as though from nowhere, a tin which flipped open to\nreveal small yellow lumps, she'd never been able to figure out\nwhere he kept it and she'd never been able to detect the magic\ninvolved. \"Lemon drop?\"",
      "\"She is a twelve-year-old girl, Albus!\u202f\"",

      "Daphne Greengrass was sitting in a comfortable black leather\ncouch, her head collapsed into her hands, glowing golden-yellowish\nas bright sparks of white light winked in and out of existence\naround her.",
      "She'd been ready to be teased about liking Neville Longbottom.\nShe'd been expecting to hear a lot of snide remarks about\nHufflepuffs. She'd thought of whole reams of snappy\ncomebacks for it while she was on the way back to the Slytherin\ndungeons.",
      "She'd been looking forward to being teased about liking\nNeville. Being teased about that sort of thing meant you'd grown up\ninto a real girl.",
      "As it turned out, nobody had worked out that her challenging\nNeville to a Most Ancient Duel meant that she liked him. She'd\nthought it would be obvious but no, nobody else had even\nthought of that apparently.",

      "But she had to carry on, because that was what heroes did, they\ncarried on, and also because it had seemed infinitely too awful to\ntell everyone she was calling it off. Hermione wondered how much\nheroism had gone on for reasons like that. Most books didn't\nsay \"And then they refused to give up, no matter how\nsensible it would have been, because that would've been too\nembarrassing\"; but a great deal of history made a lot more sense\nthat way.",
      "At 7:15pm, Professor McGonagall had told her, Headmaster\nDumbledore would come down and talk to them for a couple of\nminutes. Professor McGonagall had said not to be frightened - the\nHeadmaster was a good person deep down, and they'd properly gotten\nthe school's authorization for the protest.",
      "But Hermione was very very aware that even if she was doing it\nwith signed permission, she was still Defying Authority.",
      "After she'd decided to be a hero, Hermione had done the obvious\nthing, and gone to the Hogwarts library and taken out books on how\nto be a hero. Then she'd returned those books back to their\nshelves, because it'd been patently obvious that none of the\nauthors had been actual heroes themselves. Instead she'd just read\nfive times over, until she'd memorized every word, the thirty\ninches by Godric Gryffindor that was all his autobiography and his\nlife's advice. (Or the English translation, anyway; she couldn't\nread Latin yet.) Godric Gryffindor's autobiography had been a lot\nmore compressed than the books Hermione was used to\nreading, he used one sentence to say things that should've\ntaken thirty inches just by themselves, and then there was\nanother sentence after that...",
      "But it was clear from what she'd read that, while Defying\nAuthority wasn't the point of being a hero, you couldn't\nbe a hero if you were too scared to do it. And Hermione Granger\nknew by now how others saw her, and she knew what other people\nthought she couldn't do.",
      "Hermione hefted her picket sign a little higher and concentrated\non breathing slowly and rhythmically instead of hyperventilating\nuntil she fell over.",
      "\"Really?\u202f\" said Miss Preece in a tone of undisguised\nfascination. \"They couldn't vote?\u202f\"",
      "\"Indeed,\" said Professor Sinistra. (The Astronomy Professor's\nhair was still dark, and her dark face only slightly lined;\nHermione would have guessed her age at around seventy,\nexcept -) \"I quite remember my mother's rejoicing when they\nannounced the Qualification of Women Act, although she did not\nactually qualify.\" (Which meant that Professor Sinistra had been\naround her Muggle family in 1918.) \"And that wasn't the worst of\nit. Why, just a few centuries earlier -\"",
      "Thirty seconds later all the non-Muggleborns, male and female\nboth, were staring at Professor Sinistra with utterly shocked\nexpressions. Hannah had dropped her sign.",
      "\"And that wasn't the worst of it either, not by half,\"\nfinished Professor Sinistra. \"But you see where this sort of thing\ncould potentially lead.\"",
      "\"Merlin preserve us,\" said Penelope Clearwater in a strangled\nvoice. \"You mean that's how men would treat us if we\ndidn't have wands to defend ourselves?\"",
      "\"Hey!\u202f\" said one of the boy prefects. \"That's\nnot -\"",
      "There was a short, sardonic laugh from the direction of\nProfessor Quirrell. When Hermione turned her head to look she saw\nthat the Defense Professor was still idly toying with the button,\nnot bothering to glance up at the rest of them, as he said, \"Such\nis human nature, Miss Clearwater. Rest assured that you\nwould be no kinder, if witches had wands and men lacked them.\"",
      "\"I hardly think so!\" snapped Professor Sinistra.",
      "A cold chuckle. \"I suspect it happens more often than any dare\nsuggest, in the proudest pureblood families. Some lonely witch\nspies a handsome Muggle; and thinks how very easy it would be, to\nslip the man a love potion, and by him be adored alone and utterly.\nAnd since she knows he can offer her no resistance, why, it is only\nnatural for her to take from him whatever she pleases -\"",
      "\"Professor Quirrell!\u202f\" said Professor McGonagall\nsharply.",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" Professor Quirrell said mildly, his eyes still\nlooking down on the button in his hand, \"are we all still\npretending it doesn't happen? My apologies, then.\"",
      "Professor Sinistra snapped, \"And I suppose that wizards don't\n-\"",
      "\"There are children present, Professors!\" Again\nProfessor McGonagall.",
      "\"Some do,\" Professor Quirrell said equably, as though discussing\nthe weather. \"Although personally, I don't.\"",
      "There was a bit of silence, for a time. Hermione put up her sign\nagain - it had slipped down to her shoulder while she was\nlistening. She'd never thought of that, not even a little, and now\nshe was trying not to think of it, and her stomach was\nfeeling a bit queasy. She looked in Harry Potter's direction, not\nquite knowing why she did; and she saw that Harry's face was\nperfectly still. A chill ran down her spine before she looked away,\nnot quite fast enough to miss the small nod that Harry gave her, as\nthough they were agreeing on something.",
      "\"To be fair,\" Professor Sinistra said after a while, \"since I\nreceived my Hogwarts letter I can't recall encountering any\nprejudice on account of being a woman, or colored. No, now it is\nall for being a Muggleborn. I believe Miss Granger said that it was\njust with heroes that she found a problem, so far?\"",
      "It took Hermione a moment to recognize that she'd been asked the\nquestion, and then she said \"Yes,\" in a tone that squeaked a\nlittle. This whole thing had blown up a bit larger than she'd\nimagined when she'd started it.",
      "\"What exactly did you check, Miss Granger?\" said Professor\nVector. She looked older than Professor Sinistra, her hair starting\nto gray a little; Hermione hadn't ever come close to Professor\nVector in person until the Arithmancy Professor had asked her for a\nbutton.",
      "\"Um,\" Hermione said, her voice a little high, \"I checked the\nhistory books and there's been as many woman Ministers of Magic as\nmen. Then I looked at Supreme Mugwumps and there were a few more\nwizards than witches but not many. But if you look at people like\nfamous Dark Wizard hunters, or people who've stopped invasions of\nDark creatures, or people who've overthrown Dark Lords -\"",
      "\"And the Dark Wizards themselves, of course,\" said Professor\nQuirrell. Now the Defense Professor had looked up. \"You\nmay add that to your list, Miss Granger. Among all the suspected\nDeath Eaters we know of only two sorceresses, Bellatrix Black and\nAlecto Carrow. And I daresay that most wizards would be\nhard-pressed to name a single Dark Lady besides Baba Yaga.\"",
      "Hermione just stared at him.",
      "He couldn't possibly be -",
      "\"Professor Quirrell,\" said Professor Vector, \"what exactly are\nyou implying?\"",
      "The Defense Professor raised the button so that the\ngolden-lettered S.P.H.E.W. faced them, and said, \"Heroes,\" then\nturned the button to show its silver backside and said, \"Dark\nWizards. They are similar career paths followed by similar people,\nand one can hardly ask why young witches are turning away from one\ncourse without considering its reflection.\"",
      "\"Oh, now I see!\" said Tracey Davis, speaking up so\nsuddenly that Hermione gave a small startle. \"You're joining our\nprotest because you're worried that not enough girls are becoming\nDark Witches!\" Then Tracey giggled, which Hermione couldn't have\nmanaged at this point if you paid her a million pounds\nsterling.",
      "There was a half-smile on Professor Quirrell's face as he\nreplied, \"Not really, Miss Davis. In truth I do not care about that\nsort of thing in the slightest. But it is futile to count the\nwitches among Ministers of Magic and other such ordinary folk\nleading ordinary existences, when Grindelwald and Dumbledore and\nHe-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named were all men.\" The Defense Professor's\nfingers idly spun the button, turning it over and over. \"Then\nagain, only a very few folk ever do anything interesting with their\nlives. What does it matter to you if they are mostly\nwitches or mostly wizards, so long as you are not among\nthem? And I suspect you will not be among them, Miss Davis; for\nalthough you are ambitious, you have no ambition.\"",
      "\"That's not true!\u202f\" said Tracey indignantly. \"And\nwhat's it mean?\"",
      "Professor Quirrell straightened from where he had been leaning\nagainst the wall. \"You were Sorted into Slytherin, Miss Davis, and\nI expect that you will grasp at any opportunity for advancement\nwhich falls into your hands. But there is no great ambition that\nyou are driven to accomplish, and you will not make your\nopportunities. At best you will grasp your way upward into Minister\nof Magic, or some other high position of unimportance, never\nbreaking the bounds of your existence.\"",
      "Then Professor Quirrell's gaze shifted away from Tracey, he was\nlooking at her, the pale blue eyes staring at her with an\nawful intensity - \"Tell me, Miss Granger. Do you\nhave an ambition?\"",
      "\"Professor -\" squeaked the high stern voice of Professor\nFlitwick, and then her Head of House's voice cut off, and from the\nside of her vision Hermione saw that Harry had laid his hand on\nProfessor Flitwick's shoulder and was shaking his head, face\nlooking very adult.",
      "Hermione felt like a deer caught in headlights.",
      "\"What drove you to break your bounds, Miss Granger?\" said the\nDefense Professor, still gazing directly at her. \"Why is getting\ngood marks in class no longer enough? Is it true greatness that you\nseek? Does some aspect of the world dissatisfy you, that you must\nremake according to your will? Or is this all merely a child's game\nto you? I will be quite disappointed if this is only about rivaling\nHarry Potter.\"",
      "\"I -\" said Hermione, her voice so high-pitched it made a sort of\npeeping sound, but then she couldn't think of what else to say.",
      "\"You may take a moment to think, if you like,\" said Professor\nQuirrell. \"Pretend it is a homework essay, six inches due Thursday.\nI hear you are quite eloquent in them.\"",
      "Everyone was looking at her.",
      "\"I -\" said Hermione. \"I don't agree with one single thing you\njust said, anywhere.\"",
      "\"Well spoken,\" came Professor McGonagall's crisp voice.",
      "Professor Quirrell's gaze did not waver. \"That is not six\ninches, Miss Granger. Something drives you to defy the\nHeadmaster's verdict and gather followers about yourself. Perhaps\nit is something you prefer not to speak aloud?\"",
      "Hermione knew the correct answer wouldn't impress Professor\nQuirrell, but it was the correct answer, so she said it. \"I don't\nthink you need ambition to be a hero,\" Hermione said. Her voice\nwavered but it didn't crack. \"I think you just have to do what's\nright. And they're not my followers, we're friends.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell leaned back against the wall again. The\nhalf-smile had faded from his face. \"Most folk tell themselves they\nare doing right, Miss Granger. They do not thereby rise above the\nordinary.\"",
      "Hermione took a couple of deep breaths, trying to be brave.\n\"It's not about being not ordinary,\" she said as stoutly\nas she could. \"But I think if someone just tries to do what's\nright, over and over again, and they're not too lazy to do all the\nwork it takes, and they think about what they're doing, and they're\nbrave enough to do it even when they're scared -\" Hermione paused\nfor an instant, her eyes darting to Tracey and Daphne, \"- and they\ncleverly plan how to do it - and they don't just do what other\npeople do - then I think someone like that would already get into\nenough trouble.\"",
      "Some of the girls and boys chuckled, as did Professor\nMcGonagall, who looked wry and proud at the same time.",
      "\"You may be right about that,\" said the Defense Professor, his\neyes half-lidded. He tossed Hermione the button, and she caught it\nwithout thinking. \"My donation to your cause, Miss Granger. I\nunderstand that they are worth two Sickles.\"",
      "The Defense Professor turned and walked away without another\nword.",
      "\"I thought I was going to faint!\" gasped Hannah after his\nfootsteps had faded, and she heard some of the other girls letting\nout their breath or putting down their signs for a moment.",
      "\"I do too have an ambition!\" said Tracey, who seemed to\nbe almost on the verge of tears. \"I'm - I'm - I'll figure out what\nit is by tomorrow, but I have one, I'm sure!\"",
      "\"If you really can't think of anything,\" Daphne said, giving\nTracey a comforting pat on the shoulder, \"just go with the oldie\nbut goodie and try to take over the world.\"",
      "\"Hey!\" said Susan sharply. \"You're supposed to be heroes now!\nThat means you have to be good!\u202f\"",
      "\"No, it's all right,\" said Lavender, \"I'm pretty sure General\nChaos wants to take over the world and he's sort of a good\nguy.\"",
      "More conversation was going on behind the picket line. \"My\ngoodness,\" said Penelope Clearwater. \"I think that's the most\novertly evil Defense Professor we've ever had.\"",
      "Professor McGonagall coughed warningly, and the Head Boy said,\n\"You weren't around for Professor Barney,\" which made several\npeople twitch.",
      "\"Professor Quirrell just talks like that,\" said Harry\nPotter, though he sounded less certain than before. \"I mean, think\nabout it, he doesn't do anything like what Professor Snape\ndoes -\"",
      "\"Mr. Potter,\" squeaked Professor Flitwick, voice polite and face\nstern, \"why did you ask me to stay silent?\"",
      "\"Professor Quirrell was testing Hermione to see if he wanted to\nbe her mysterious old wizard,\" Harry said. \"Which totally would not\nhave worked out in any way, shape, or form, but she had to answer\nfor herself.\"",
      "Hermione blinked.",
      "Then Hermione blinked again, as she realized that it was\nProfessor Quirrell who was Harry Potter's mysterious old wizard,\nand not Dumbledore at all, and that really wasn't a good sign\n-",
      "A rumbling noise filled the small stone vestibule, and Hermione,\nher nerves already on edge, spun rapidly around, almost dropping\nher protest sign as her other hand darted toward her wand.",
      "The gargoyles were stepping aside, the Flowing Stone rumbling\nlike rock as it moved like flesh. The huge ugly figures waited only\nbriefly, dead gray eyes staring out in silent vigil. Then the great\ngargoyles folded their wings back into place and stepped back into\ntheir former positions, the Flowing Stone not changing its outward\nappearance at all as it returned from flexibility to\nmotionlessness, and the brief gap in the stone of Hogwarts was\nsolid once more.",
      "And before them all, wearing robes of bright purple that\nprobably only looked hideous if you were Muggleborn, stood the\ntowering form of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, the\nHeadmaster of Hogwarts, the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, the\nSupreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards, the\nvanquisher of the Dark Lord Grindelwald and protector of Britain,\nthe rediscoverer of the fabled Twelve Uses of Dragon's Blood, the\nmost powerful wizard alive; and he was looking at her,\nHermione Jean Granger, General of the recently expanded Sunshine\nRegiment, who was getting the best grades in the first year of\nHogwarts classes, and who had declared herself a heroine.",
      "Even her name was shorter than his.",
      "The Headmaster smiled benevolently at her, his wrinkle-lined\neyes twinkling cheerfully beneath their half-circles of glass, and\nsaid, \"Hello, Miss Granger.\"",
      "The odd thing was that it wasn't nearly as scary as talking to\nProfessor Quirrell. \"Hello, Headmaster Dumbledore,\" Hermione said\nwith only a slight quaver in her voice.",
      "\"Miss Granger,\" said Dumbledore, now looking more serious, \"I\nthink you and I may have had a bit of a misunderstanding. I did not\nmean to imply that you could not, or should not be a hero. I\ncertainly did not mean to imply that witches in general should not\nbe heroes. Only that you were... a bit young, to be thinking of\nsuch things.\"",
      "Hermione, unable to help herself, glanced at Professor\nMcGonagall and saw that Professor McGonagall was giving her an\nencouraging smile - or she was giving the two of them some\nkind of smile, anyway - so Hermione looked back at the Headmaster\nand said, the small quaver in her voice a little larger now, \"Since\nyou became Headmaster forty years ago, there've been eleven\nstudents to graduate Hogwarts who became heroes, I mean people like\nLupe Cazaril and so on, and ten of those were boys.\nCimorene Linderwall was the only witch.\"",
      "\"Hm,\" said the Headmaster. There was a thoughtful expression on\nhis face; he at least seemed to be thinking about it.\n\"Miss Granger, I have never been one for tallying such numbers.\nOften it is too much easier to count than to understand. Many good\npeople have come out of Hogwarts, witches and wizards both; those\nfamed as heroes are only one kind of good person, and perhaps not\nthe highest. You did not include Alice Longbottom or Lily Potter in\nyour reckoning... But leave that aside. Tell me, Miss Granger, did\nyou tally how many heroes came out of Hogwarts in the forty years\nbefore me? For in that time I can recall only three now called\nheroes; and among those three, no witches at all.\"",
      "\"I'm not trying to say it's just you!\" Hermione said.\n\"Only I think maybe a lot of people, like the Headmasters\nbefore you too, maybe even your whole society and everything, might\nbe discouraging girls.\"",
      "The old wizard sighed. His half-glasses eyes looked only at her,\nas though they were the only two people present. \"Miss Granger, it\nmight be possible to discourage witches from becoming Charms\nMistresses, or Quidditch players, or even Aurors. But not heroes.\nIf someone is meant to be a hero then a hero they will be. They\nwill walk through fire and swim through ice. Dementors will not\nstop them, nor the deaths of friends, and not discouragement\neither.\"",
      "\"Well,\" Hermione said, and paused, struggling with the words.\n\"Well, I mean... what if that's not actually true? I mean,\nto me it seems that if you want more witches to be heroes,\nyou ought to teach them heroing.\"",
      "\"Many boys and girls are heroes in their dreams,\" Dumbledore\nsaid quietly. He did not look at any of the other girls, only at\nher. \"Fewer in the waking world. Many have stood their ground and\nfaced the darkness when it comes for them. Fewer come for the\ndarkness and force it to face them. It is a hard life, sometimes\nlonely, often short. I have told none to refuse that calling, but\nneither would I wish to increase their number.\"",
      "Hermione hesitated; there was something in the lined face that\nstopped her, like a hint to all the emotion that wasn't being\ndisplayed, years and years of it...",
      "Maybe if there were more heroes, their lives wouldn't be so\nlonely, or so short.",
      "She couldn't bring herself to say that, though, not to him.",
      "\"But the point is moot,\" said the old wizard. He smiled, a bit\nruefully she thought. \"Miss Granger, you cannot teach heroism like\nyou would teach Charms. You cannot assign twelve inches on how to\ncarry on when all hope seems lost. You cannot rehearse students on\nwhen to stand up and tell the Headmaster he has done wrong. Heroes\nare born, not taught. And for whatever reason, more of them are\nborn boys than girls.\" The Headmaster shrugged, as if to say that\nhe was helpless to do anything about that.",
      "\"Um,\" Hermione said. She couldn't help it, she glanced behind\nher.",
      "Professor Sinistra was looking a bit indignant. And it\nwasn't true that everyone was staring at her like she'd\njust been silly, the way she'd started to imagine while she was\nlistening to Dumbledore.",
      "Hermione turned back to face Dumbledore again, took a deep\nbreath, and said, \"Well, maybe people who are going to be heroes,\nwill be heroes no matter what. But I don't see how anyone could\nreally know that, aside from just saying it afterward. And\nwhen I told you that I wanted to be a hero, you weren't\nvery encouraging.\"",
      "\"Mr. Potter,\" the Headmaster said mildly. His eyes didn't leave\nhers. \"Please tell Miss Granger your impression of our own first\nmeeting. Would you say that I was encouraging? Speak the\ntruth.\"",
      "There was a pause.",
      "\"Mr. Potter?\" said Professor Vector's voice from behind her,\nsounding puzzled.",
      "\"Um,\" Harry's voice said from further back, sounding extremely\nreluctant. \"Um... well, actually in my case the Headmaster set fire\nto a chicken.\"",
      "\"He what?\u202f\" Hermione blurted, only there were several\nother people exclaiming things at around the same time so she\nwasn't sure anyone heard her.",
      "Dumbledore went on gazing at her, looking perfectly serious.",
      "\"I didn't know about Fawkes,\" Harry's voice said rapidly, \"so he\ntold me that Fawkes was a phoenix, while he was pointing to a\nchicken on Fawkes's stand so I'd think that was Fawkes,\nand then he set the chicken on fire - and also he gave me this big\nrock and told me it had belonged to my father and I ought to carry\nit everywhere -\"",
      "\"But that's crazy!\u202f\" Susan blurted out.",
      "There was a sudden hush.",
      "The Headmaster slowly turned his head to stare at Susan.",
      "\"I -\" said Susan. \"I mean - I -\"",
      "The Headmaster leaned down until he was face-to-face with the\nyoung girl.",
      "\"I didn't -\" said Susan.",
      "Dumbledore put a finger to his lips and twiddled them, making a\nbweeble-bweeble-bweeble sound.",
      "The Headmaster straightened up again and said, \"Well, my good\nheroines, it has been pleasant speaking to you, but alas, much else\nremains to do this day. Still, rest assured that I am inscrutable\nat everyone, not just witches.\"",
      "The gargoyles stepped aside, the Flowing Stone rumbling like\nrock as it moved like flesh.",
      "The huge ugly figures waited briefly with dead gray eyes staring\nout in silent vigil, as Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore,\nsmiling as benevolently as when he'd first emerged from his office,\nstepped back into the Enchantment of the Endless Stair.",
      "Then the great gargoyles folded their wings back into place and\nstepped back into their former positions, only one last brief\n\"Bwa-ha-ha!\" echoing out before the gap closed.",
      "There was a long silence.",
      "\"He really set a chicken on fire?\" said Hannah.",
      "The eight of them had continued protesting even after that, but\nto be honest their heart had gone out of it.",
      "It had been established, after some careful questions\nfrom Professor Flitwick, that Harry Potter hadn't smelled the\nchicken burning. Which meant that it had probably been a pebble or\nsomething, Transfigured into a chicken and then enclosed in a\nBoundary Charm to make sure that no smoke escaped into the air -\nboth Professor Flitwick and Professor McGonagall had been very\nemphatic about nobody trying that without their supervision.",
      "But still...",
      "But still... what?",
      "Hermione didn't even know but still what.",
      "But still.",
      "After a lot of glances exchanged between girls none of whom had\nwanted to be first to say it, Hermione had declared the protest\nover, and the adults and boys had drifted off.",
      "\"You don't think we were being unfair to Dumbledore, do you?\"\nsaid Susan as the heroines walked away to the sound of eight pairs\nof feet trodding on the stone paving of Hogwarts's corridors. \"I\nmean, if he is crazy at everyone and not just at witches\nthen it's not discrimination, right?\"",
      "\"I don't want to protest against the Headmaster any more,\"\nHannah said weakly. The Hufflepuff girl seemed a bit unsteady on\nher feet. \"I don't care what Professor McGonagall says about him\nnot holding it against us, it's just too much for my nerves.\"",
      "Lavender snorted. \"I guess you won't be slaying armies\nof Inferi anytime soon -\"",
      "\"Stop that!\" Hermione said sharply. \"Look, all of us have got to\nlearn to be heroines, right? It's okay if someone doesn't\nknow right away.\"",
      "\"The Headmaster doesn't think it can be learned,\" Padma\nsaid. The Ravenclaw girl's face was thoughtful, her steps measured\nas she strode through the corridor. \"The Headmaster doesn't even\nthink that's a good idea.\"",
      "Daphne was striding with her back straight and her head held\nbolt upright, looking more like a Proper Young Lady in her Hogwarts\nrobes than Hermione could have done with her best formal dress.\n\"The Headmaster,\" Daphne said in a precise voice, her shoes making\nhard, sharp tacking sounds on the stone, \"thinks the lot of us are\na bunch of silly girls playing games, and that someday Hermione\nmight make a good sidekick but the rest of us are hopeless.\"",
      "\"Is he right?\u202f\" said Parvati. The Gryffindor girl's\nface was very serious, making her look much more like her twin than\nshe usually did. \"I mean it has to be asked -\"",
      "\"No!\u202f\" spat Tracey. The Slytherin girl was stalking\nthrough the hallway looking ready to kill someone, like a\nminiature female Snape. Of all the girls, Tracey was the one who\nHermione knew least. Hermione had talked to Lavender once before,\nbut she'd never really seen Tracey except at wandpoint\nduring a battle, until the Slytherin had jumped up from her sofa to\nvolunteer. \"We'll show him! We'll show them all!\u202f\"",
      "\"Okay,\" said Susan, \"that was definitely evil -\"",
      "\"No,\" said Lavender, \"that's a Chaos Legion motto, actually.\nOnly she didn't do the insane laughter.\"",
      "\"That's right,\" Tracey said, her voice low and grim. \"This time\nI'm not laughing.\" The girl went on stalking through the corridor,\nlike she had dramatic music accompanying her that only she could\nhear.",
      "(Hermione was starting to worry about what exactly the\nimpressionable youths of the Chaos Legion were learning from Harry\nPotter.)",
      "\"But - I mean -\" Parvati said. She still had a contemplative\nlook on her face. \"I mean, you can see why the Headmaster\nwould think we were just silly girls, right? What does protesting\noutside the Headmaster's office have to do with becoming\nheroines?\"",
      "\"Huh,\" Lavender said, now looking thoughtful herself. \"That's\ntrue. We should do something heroic. I mean heroinic.\"",
      "\"Um -\" said Hannah, which very much expressed Hermione's own\nfeelings on the subject.",
      "\"Well,\" said Parvati, \"has everyone already been through\nDumbledore's third-floor forbidden corridor? I mean everyone in\nGryffindor's been through it by now -\"",
      "\"Hold on!\u202f\" Hermione said desperately. \"I don't want\nyou doing anything dangerous!\u202f\"",
      "There was a pause while everyone looked at Hermione, who was\nrealizing, much too late, why Dumbledore hadn't wanted anyone\nelse to be a hero.",
      "\"I don't think you can become a heroine if you never do anything\ndangerous,\" Lavender observed reasonably.",
      "\"Besides,\" said Padma, a considering look on her face. \"Everyone\nknows that nothing really bad ever happens in Hogwarts,\nright? To students, I mean, not to the Defense Professors. We've\ngot all these ancient wards and so on.\"",
      "\"Um -\" Hannah said again.",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Parvati, \"the worst that can happen is that we'll\nlose a few dozen House points or something, and there's two of us\nfrom each House so that'll all come out even.\"",
      "\"Why, that's brilliant, Hermione!\" said Daphne in a\ntone of great amazement. \"The way you set it up means we can get\naway with anything! And I didn't even notice your cunning\nplan until now!\"",
      "\"UM -\" said Hermione, Hannah, and Susan.",
      "\"Right!\" said Parvati. \"So now it's time for us to become real\nheroines. We'll come for the darkness -\"",
      "\"And make it face us -\" said Lavender.",

      "\"Well,\" Daphne whispered, keeping her voice as low as she could,\n\"at least now I don't feel like the only sane person in Hogwarts\nany more.\"",
      "\"Because now you've got the rest of us as friends?\" whispered\nLavender Brown, who was tiptoeing along at her left side.",
      "\"I don't think that's what she means,\" General Granger murmured\nfrom Lavender's own left.",
      "They crept slowly and carefully through the corridors of\nHogwarts, all eight of them keeping both ears peeled for the\nslightest sound of Trouble, just like it was a battle and they were\nlooking for enemy soldiers to ambush; only in this case they were\nlooking for bullies to Vanquish and victims to Rescue in the span\nbetween the end of breakfast-time and when Lavender and Parvati had\nto get to their Herbology class.",
      "Lavender had argued that if one first-year girl could take down\nthree older bullies, then eight first-year girls ought to be able\nto outfight twenty-four older bullies because of\nMultiplication.",
      "Judging by her frantic spluttering and waving of hands, General\nGranger hadn't found this convincing.",
      "Padma had stayed silent for a bit during the ensuing argument,\nand then observed thoughtfully that even in Hogwarts, beating up\nfirst-year girls probably wouldn't be good for your reputation as a\nbully.",
      "Parvati had straightened up at this, exclaiming that this meant\nthey were the only ones who could do something about\nHogwarts's bully problem, which made it really truly\nheroinic. Plus the whole reason their parents had moved to\nBritain was so that the two of them could attend the world's only\nmagical school with a 0% fatality rate, and what was the point if\nthey didn't take advantage and try a few things?",
      "To which General Granger had responded that Parvati didn't\nunderstand the point of a perfect safety record at all\n-",
      "Lavender had said that if they were really all friends\ntogether and not Hermione's followers like Professor Quirrell\nthought, then they should vote on things like this.",
      "Daphne had expected that hers would be the deciding vote after\nHermione and Susan and Hannah voted no. And so Daphne had\nconsidered it carefully after her first flush of enthusiasm wore\noff. She was a Slytherin, after all, and that meant it was\nher responsibility to keep a watchful eye on their own\ninterests while they were all running around trying to help people\n- her job to figure out how risky it really was, and whether it\nwould be worth it for them, just like Mother would have\ndone in her place. Always looking out for yourself and your friends\nlike that, was what real Slytherining was all about...",
      "Hannah Abbott, the nervous little Hufflepuff girl, had in a\nsmall trembling voice said \"Yes.\"",
      "And now Daphne and Susan and Hermione had to stay with\nthe other five, they couldn't possibly let the others go\noff on their own. Because no Gryffindor would ever live down\nhurting the last surviving child of the Bones family, and no\nSlytherin would dare assault a daughter of the Noble and Most\nAncient House of Greengrass. (Daphne hoped so, anyway.)\nAnd General Granger who'd started the whole thing... you didn't\neven have to ask.",
      "The corridors of Hogwarts passed them by one after another,\ntheir tense hands never straying far from their wands, as stone and\nwood and Everburning Torches came into vision and then moved past.\nAt one point they heard footsteps and drew in their breath, hands\nalmost dropping to their wands, but it was just a lone older\nRavenclaw who looked at them curiously before sniffing and dropping\nhis head back to his book as he walked on.",
      "The heroines crept past solemn oaken panels carved with gilded\nfrescos, and came to a dead end leading into a boys' bathroom, and\nturned around, and wandered back through the solemn oaken\npanels carved with gilded frescos, and then turned through dusty\nold brick corridors grouted with worn cement, which sort of led\nthem in a circle actually, so they consulted a portrait and then\nwent down a different dusty old brick corridor instead,\nthat took them to a brief rise of marble stairs that should've put\nthem on the third-and-a-halfth floor if it'd been anywhere but\nHogwarts, and then it was back to tiled stone pavement again, and\nskylights that let shafts of sunlight pour down even though they\nwere nowhere near the roof, and after they'd followed that\npassageway around a few corners it took them to another boys'\nbathroom, clearly marked with a plaque showing the silhouette of a\nrobed figure whizzing into a toilet.",
      "The eight of them stood before the closed door and stared with a\ncertain amount of weariness.",
      "\"I'm bored,\" said Lavender.",
      "Padma made a show of taking a pocketwatch out of her robes and\nlooking at it. \"Sixteen minutes and thirty seconds,\" she said. \"A\nnew record for the longest attention span in Gryffindor.\"",
      "\"I don't think this is going to work either,\" said\nSusan. \"And I'm a Hufflepuff.\"",
      "\"Y'know,\" Lavender said thoughtfully, \"I wonder if maybe what\nreally makes someone a hero, is that when they try\nsomething like this, something interesting actually\nhappens.\"",
      "\"I bet you're right,\" said Tracey. \"I bet if we had Harry\nPotter with us, we'd run into three bullies and a hidden room\nfull of treasure in the first five minutes. I bet that all General\nChaos has to do is go to the bathroom and he, like, finds\nSlytherin's Chamber of Secrets or something -\"",
      "Daphne couldn't quite let that one go past. \"You think Lord\nSlytherin would've put the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets in a\nbathroom -\"",
      "\"What I'm saying,\" said Susan, as Tracey was opening\nher mouth to reply, \"is that we've got no way of actually\nfinding any bullies. I mean, all they've got to\ndo is find a Hufflepuff somewhere, but we've got to run across them\nat exactly the right time, d'you see? Which is a very\ngood problem because if we did find them we'd all get\nsquished like bugs. Can't we just do the forbidden third-floor\ncorridor like we're supposed to?\"",
      "Lavender snorted scornfully. \"You don't become a real\nheroine just by doing the forbidden things the Headmaster\ntells you not to do!\"",
      "(Daphne's mind tried to wrap around this statement as she\nsilently thanked the Sorting Hat for not putting her anywhere near\nGryffindor.)",
      "\"Come to think...\" Parvati said slowly, \"I mean, what're the\nodds that Harry Potter would run across those five bullies on his\nfirst morning of school? He must've had some way\nof finding them.\"",
      "Daphne happened to be standing where looking at Parvati let her\nsee Hermione, so she noticed the Ravenclaw girl's expression change\n- and then she realized that the Sunshine General had also\nfound some bullies just recently -",
      "\"Oh!\" said Padma in a tone of sudden realization. \"Of course! He\ngot told by the ghost of Salazar Slytherin!\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" said Daphne at the same time as several other\npeople.",
      "\"That's who the ghost was that scared me, I'm pretty sure,\"\nPadma explained. \"I mean I only figured it out afterward, but...\nyeah. Salazar Slytherin's ghost doesn't like it when Slytherins\nbully people, he thinks it shames his name, and the ghost is still\nkeyed into the Hogwarts wards so he knows everything that happens,\nI bet.\"",
      "Daphne's mouth was hanging open; and she saw that Hannah had put\na hand to her forehead and was leaning against the stone walls,\nwhile Tracey's eyes were blazing like little brown stars.",
      "Salazar Slytherin's ghost?",
      "Had leagued himself with Harry Potter?",
      "And had sent Hermione Granger to stop Derrick's\ncrew?",
      "She would have paid a hundred Galleons to be there when Draco\nMalfoy got told about this.",
      "Although considering how fast rumors spread through Hogwarts,\nnow that Padma had spilled the beans, Millicent had probably told\nhim thirty minutes ago...",
      "In fact... now that Daphne thought about it...",
      "\"So,\" said Parvati. \"We've got to ask the Boy-Who-Lived where to\nfind Salazar Slytherin's ghost? Wow, I guess if I'm saying stuff\nlike that out loud, I might actually be turning into a heroine\n-\"",
      "\"Yes!\" said Lavender. \"We've got to ask the Boy-Who-Lived where\nto find Salazar Slytherin's ghost!\"",
      "\"We've got to ask... the Boy-Who-Lived... where to find Salazar\nSlytherin's ghost...\" repeated Hannah in a nervous voice, like she\nwas forcing herself to say it.",
      "\"And if that doesn't work,\" shouted Tracey, \"we'll stun\nHarry Potter, tie him up and bring him with us!\"",
      "It said something, Hermione Granger thought, and it was\nsomething rather sad - as the eight of them strolled back through\nthe maze of twisty little passages that was Hogwarts, their time\nbefore the next class having run out without finding any bullies -\nthat she genuinely didn't know whether Harry Potter had been led\naround by the ghost of Salazar Slytherin or a phoenix or\nwhat. And whatever Harry had done, she hoped it\ndidn't work for them. And most of all she hoped that the\nothers didn't vote for Tracey's idea of stunning Harry Potter and\ncarting his unconscious body around with them to attract\nAdventures. That couldn't possibly work in real life, or, if it\ndid, she was giving up.",
      "Hermione looked from witch to witch, Tracey chatting with\nLavender, and the others making occasional remarks; and her gaze\ncaught on a girl who was subdued and quiet, the one person whose\nthoughts right now she couldn't guess at all.",
      "\"Hannah?\" she said to the girl walking alongside her. Hermione\ntried to make her voice as gentle as she could. \"You don't have to\nanswer, but is it okay if I ask why you voted yes on fighting\nbullies?\"",
      "Hermione had thought she'd made her voice soft, but everyone\nstopped walking, and Lavender and Tracey halted their conversation\nand looked at them.",
      "Hannah's cheeks were already reddening, and just as Hannah\nopened her mouth -",
      "\"It's 'cause she's got more courage than you think,\nobviously,\" said Lavender.",
      "Hannah paused with her mouth open.",
      "She closed her mouth.",
      "She swallowed, hard and visibly, while her cheeks reddened even\nfurther.",
      "Then Hannah took a deep breath, and said, in a small voice,\n\"There's a boy I like.\"",
      "The Hufflepuff girl flinched as she said it, and her head darted\naround nervously to look at everyone looking at her, while the\npause and silence stretched.",
      "\"Um, okay?\" Susan said eventually.",
      "\"I've got five boys I like,\" said Lavender.",
      "\"Padma and I knew we'd both like the same boys,\" said Parvati,\n\"so we made a list and flipped a Knut to see who got to pick\nfirst.\"",
      "\"I know who I'm destined to marry,\" said Tracey. \"I\ndon't care what the world says, he's meant to be mine!\"",
      "This made all the other girls look expectantly at Hermione,\nwhose brain had gone ahead and flushed Tracey's last statement\nentirely so it could focus on just on the first thing Hannah had\nsaid.",
      "\"Um,\" said Hermione. She carefully continued keeping her voice\ngentle. \"Hannah, the reason why you joined the Society for\nPromotion of Heroic Equality for Witches was that there's a boy who\nmight like you more if you become a hero?\"",
      "The Hufflepuff girl nodded again, her cheeks reddening even\nfurther while she stared down at her own reflection in her\nblack-polished shoes.",
      "\"She likes Neville Longbottom, actually,\" Daphne said. The\nSlytherin gave a woeful sigh. \"And unfortunately for her, he's\ngoing to marry someone else. It's very tragic.\"",
      "This produced a high-pitched eeping sound from Hannah\nas she went on staring at her feet.",
      "\"Wait what?\" said Lavender. \"Neville's going to marry someone\nelse? How do you know about this? Who?\u202f\"",
      "Daphne just shook her head sadly with a downcast expression.",
      "\"Excuse me,\" said Hermione, and then when the others\nlooked at her again, \"Ah...\" while she tried to organize her\nthoughts. \"I mean, um... Hannah... trying to become a hero so that\na boy will like you isn't very feminist.\"",
      "\"It's pronounced feminine actually,\" said Padma.",
      "\"And why're you calling Hannah unfeminine?\" said Susan. \"There's\nnothing unfeminine about wanting to impress a boy.\"",
      "\"Besides,\" said Parvati, sounding puzzled, \"isn't the whole\npoint that we're trying to be heroes even though that isn't\nfeminine?\"",
      "The ensuing discussion would not be remembered by Hermione\nGranger as one of her most successful forays into the realms of\npolitical education. She tried to explain, and then after the\nresulting argument tried to explain again, while the other seven\ngirls looked at her more and more skeptically. Afterward Daphne\ndeclared in the imperious tones of the future Lady Greengrass that\nif this feminism business meant girls weren't allowed to pursue\nboys in whichever way they pleased, then feminism could stay in the\nMuggle lands where it belonged. Lavender suggested that maybe\nwitchism could say that witches got to do anything they wanted,\nwhich sounded like more fun than feminism. And finally Padma closed\noff further discussion by observing wearily that she didn't see\nmuch point to going on arguing, since S.P.H.E.W. wasn't\nabout anything to do with feminism in the first place, it\nwas just about more girls becoming heroes.",
      "Hermione had given up at that point.",
      "As their Charms session that day ended and the first-year\nRavenclaws began shuffling out of the class, Hermione was already\nwincing to herself. They'd made it to class just barely before the\nopening gong, they'd had to run right over to their desks and sit\ndown, so there hadn't been time for the awful thing to happen\nyet; but that just meant that Hermione got to look forward\nto the coming disaster for the whole class.",
      "Sure enough, after Professor Flitwick squeaked his dismissal and\neveryone rose from their chairs, Harry began walking toward her;\nand for her own part Hermione shoved her book into her mokeskin\npouch and very quickly walked over to the door and threw it open\nand headed into the corridors, and of course Harry followed her\nwith a surprised look because they had a library session scheduled\n-",
      "\"Hermione?\" Harry said as he closed the door behind him. \"What's\nwrong?\"",
      "The door flew open behind Harry not a moment after he closed it,\nalmost hitting Harry as he stepped out of the way, and Padma Patil\nstepped out of the classroom with a dreadful look of determination\nupon her face.",
      "\"Excuse me, Mr. Potter,\" came the awful words, the young girl's\nhigh voice resounding through the corridor like the gloomy bells of\ndoom, \"can I ask you for help with something?\"",
      "Harry's eyebrows drew up, and he said, \"You can ask, of\ncourse.\"",
      "\"Can you tell us how to talk to Salazar Slytherin's ghost? We\nwant him to tell us where to find bullies, like he tells you.\"",
      "There was a little bit of silence in the corridor outside the\nclassroom.",
      "The door opened again, and Su peered out with an inquiring look\n-",
      "\"Well, we've got to get to the library,\" Harry said quite\ncasually, his face looking relaxed, \"would you mind following us?\"\nand began to walk off in the direction that led to the library on\nodd-numbered days of the month, and Su made like she was going to\nfollow but Harry's face turned toward her for a moment.",
      "It wasn't until Harry had rounded a corner that he drew his\nwand, said in a low precise voice \"Quietus\" and then\nturned to Padma and said, \"An interesting guess, Miss Patil.\"",
      "Padma looked rather smug, then; and said, \"I should've\nfigured it out earlier, really. There was that hiss in the\nghost's voice, I should've thought Parselmouth right away, even\nbefore he started talking about Godric Gryffindor.\"",
      "Harry's face didn't change. \"May I ask, Miss Patil, whether\nyou've shared this thought with -\"",
      "\"She said it in front of everyone in S.P.H.E.W.,\" Hermione\nsaid.",
      "Harry's eyes had that look they had when he was very rapidly\ncalculating something, and then he said, \"Hermione, what's the\nchance that -\"",
      "\"She said it in front of Lavender and Tracey.\"",
      "\"Um,\" said Padma. \"Should I not've done that?\"",
      "\"Wait here,\" growled Mr. Goyle, and went around the corner; and\nthere was the sound of him knocking on Draco Malfoy's private\nroom.",
      "There was a bit of a queasy feeling in Tracey's stomach, and she\nreminded herself again that since Padma had spilled the beans\nsomeone was bound to tell Draco Malfoy, and it might as\nwell be her, and it wasn't as if she owed Harry\nPotter anything, and a Slytherin had to do what was necessary to\nachieve her Ambitions.",
      "She'd been collecting Ambitions ever since Professor Quirrell\ntold her off, and so far she'd decided that she wanted to own her\nown Nimbus 2000 broomstick, become super famous, marry Harry\nPotter, eat Chocolate Frogs for breakfast every day, and defeat at\nleast three Dark Lords just to show Professor Quirrell who\nwas ordinary.",
      "\"Mr. Malfoy will see you,\" said the low, menacing voice of Mr.\nGoyle as he returned. \"And you'd better hope he doesn't think\nyou're wasting his time.\" The boy loomed at her briefly, and then\nstepped aside.",
      "Tracey added having her own servants to her list of Ambitions,\nand entered.",
      "The Malfoy private bedroom looked just like Daphne's. She'd been\nprivately hoping for diamond chandeliers or golden frescos on the\nwalls - she'd never have said it in front of Daphne, but the House\nof Malfoy was a step up from Greengrass. But it was just a\nsmall bedroom like Daphne's, and the only difference was that\nMalfoy's stuff was decorated in silver snakes instead of emerald\nplants.",
      "As she stepped through the doorway, Draco Malfoy - who was\nperfectly groomed even inside his own bedroom - rose up from his\ndesk chair to greet her with a small friendly bow, wearing a\ncharming smile just like she was someone who mattered,\nwhich made Tracey so flustered that she forgot everything she'd\nrehearsed inside her head and just blurted out, \"I've got something\nto tell you!\"",
      "\"Yes, Gregory said so,\" Draco Malfoy said smoothly. \"Please,\nMiss Davis, sit down.\" He gestured to his own desk chair,\neven as he sat down on his bed.",
      "She felt somewhat lightheaded as she carefully sat herself down\nin Malfoy's own chair, her fingers unthinkingly fiddling with how\nher dress robes fell across her knees, trying to make them look as\nelegant and uncreased as Draco Malfoy's -",
      "\"So, Miss Davis,\" said Draco Malfoy. \"What did you want to tell\nme?\"",
      "Tracey hesitated, and then when Malfoy's face started to look a\nbit impatient, just stammered it all out, everything Padma had said\nabout Salazar Slytherin's ghost sending Harry Potter to stop\nbullies and also what Daphne had told her about Hermione Granger\nbeing in on it -",
      "Draco Malfoy's expression didn't change at all as she spoke, not\neven in the slightest, and it dawned on Tracey with a sickening\nlurch in her stomach.",
      "\"You don't believe me!\" she said.",
      "There was a slight pause.",
      "\"Well,\" said Draco Malfoy, with a smile that wasn't quite as\ncharming as his last one, \"I do believe that's what Padma\nsaid and what Daphne said, so thank you anyway, Miss Davis.\" The\nboy rose from where he'd been sitting on his bed, and Tracey, not\neven thinking, rose from the chair.",
      "As he was escorting her to the door, just as he was about to\nturn the knob, it occurred to Tracey that - \"You didn't ask what I\nwanted for the information,\" she said.",
      "Draco Malfoy gave her some kind of look, she didn't quite know\nwhat it was supposed to mean, and he didn't say anything.",
      "\"Well, anyway,\" Tracey said, making an on-the-spot change to her\nprevious Plans, \"I don't want anything for the\ninformation, I was just being friendly.\"",
      "A brief look of surprise crossed Draco Malfoy's face for just an\ninstant before his expression flattened again and he said, \"It's\nnot that easy to become friends with a Malfoy, Miss Davis.\"",
      "Tracey smiled, and meant it. \"Well, I'll just go on being\nfriendly, then,\" she said, and left the room with a skip in her\nstep, feeling like a real Slytherin for maybe the first time in her\nlife, and having just decided that Draco Malfoy would be one of her\nhusbands too.",
      "After the girl was gone, Gregory came in, shut the door again\nand said, \"Are you alright, Mr. Malfoy?\"",
      "Draco said nothing to his servant and friend. His eyes gazed off\ninto nowhere, like he was trying to stare through the wall of his\nbedroom, through the Hogwarts lake that surrounded the Slytherin\ndungeons, through Earth's crust and atmosphere and the interstellar\ndust of the Milky Way, into the utterly empty and lightless void\nbetween galaxies which no wizard and no scientist had ever\nseen.",
      "\"Mr. Malfoy?\" Gregory said, starting to sound a little\nworried.",
      "\"I can't believe I believed every word of that,\" said Draco.",
      "Daphne finished her final inch of Transfiguration and looked up\nacross the Slytherin common room, at where Millicent Bulstrode was\nstill working on her own homework. It was time to come to a\nDecision.",
      "If S.P.H.E.W. did go around trying to stun bullies, the bullies\nwouldn't like it, that was certain. And they'd try to do something\nunpleasant about it, which was also certain. On the other hand, if\nthe bullies got really nasty then Hermione could ask Harry Potter\nfor help, or they could pool their combined Quirrell points and ask\nthe Defense Professor for a favor... No, the thing that Daphne was\nreally worried about was if this business got them in bad\nwith Professor Snape. You didn't want to ever end up on\nthe wrong side of Professor Snape.",
      "But since the day she'd challenged Neville to a Most Ancient\nDuel, she'd noticed people looking at her differently. Even the\nSlytherins who'd made fun of her were looking at her differently.\nIt was dawning on Daphne that being the daughter of the Noble and\nMost Ancient House of Greengrass brought in a lot more\nrespect if you were a beautiful heroine born to a Most\nAncient House, and not just a pretty noble girl. It was the\ndifference between having your role played by the lead actress and\nhaving your role played by a two-Galleon extra with a screechy\nlaugh.",
      "Fighting bullies might not be the best way to become a\nheroine. But Father had once told her that the trouble with passing\nup opportunities was that it was habit-forming. If you told\nyourself you were waiting for a better opportunity next time, why,\nnext time you'd probably tell yourself the same thing. Father had\nsaid that most people spent their whole lives waiting for\nan opportunity that was good enough, and then they died. Father had\nsaid that while seizing opportunities would mean that all\nsorts of things went wrong, it wasn't nearly as bad as being a\nhopeless lump. Father had said that after she got into the\nhabit of seizing opportunities, then it was time to start\nbeing picky about them.",
      "On the other hand, Mother had warned her not to take all of\nFather's advice, and said that Daphne wasn't allowed to ask about\nFather's sixth year in Hogwarts until she was at least thirty years\nold.",
      "But in the end Father had gotten Mother to marry him\nand successfully plotted his way into a Most Ancient House, so\nthere was that.",
      "Millicent Bulstrode finished her homework and began putting her\nthings away.",
      "Daphne stood up from her desk, and walked over.",
      "Millicent swung out her legs from the table and stood up,\nslinging her bookbag over one shoulder, then looked over at where\nDaphne was approaching, the girl's expression puzzled.",
      "\"Hey, Millicent,\" Daphne said as she drew near, making her voice\nlow and excited, \"guess what I figured out today?\"",
      "\"The thing about Salazar Slytherin's ghost helping Granger?\"\nsaid Millicent. \"I already heard about that -\"",
      "\"No,\" Daphne said in a hushed whisper, \"this is even\nbetter.\"",
      "\"Really?\" Millicent said, in an equally low excited voice. \"What\nis it?\"",
      "Daphne looked around conspiratorially. \"Come to my room and I'll\ntell you.\"",
      "They went off toward the stairs that led downward, the private\nrooms were even lower in the lake than the seventh-year\ndorms...",
      "Soon enough Daphne was sitting in her comfy desk-chair and\nMillicent had bounced over to the edge of her bed.",
      "\"Quietus,\" said Daphne, when they were both seated; and\nthen instead of putting her wand away inside her robes, Daphne just\nlet her hand fall naturally down to her side, still holding the\nwand, just in case.",
      "\"All right!\u202f\" said Millicent. \"What is\nit?\"",
      "\"You know what I figured out?\" said Daphne. \"I figured out that\nyou get the gossip so fast, you know about things\nbefore they actually happen.\"",
      "Daphne had half-expected Millicent to turn white and fall over,\nand she didn't really, but the girl did flinch pretty hard before\nshe started stammering denials.",
      "\"Don't worry,\" said Daphne with her sweetest smile, \"I won't\ntell anyone else you're a seer. I mean, we're friends, right?\"",
      "Rianne Felthorne, seventh-year of Slytherin, was working\ndiligently on yet another two-foot essay (she was taking everything\nexcept Divination and Muggle Studies and her N.E.W.T. year seemed\nto consist entirely of homework) when her Head of House\nstrode up to the table she was working at and barked \"You will come\nwith me, Miss Felthorne!\" and walked away even as she frantically\nbegan putting away her parchment and book and quill.",
      "When she caught up with Professor Snape, he was waiting just\noutside the room and gazing at her with half-lidded eyes that\nseemed far too intense; and before she could ask what this was\nabout he spun without a word and stalked off through the hallways,\nso that she had to scramble to keep up.",
      "Their walk took them down a flight of stairs, and then another,\nbelow what she'd thought was the lowest level of the Slytherin\ndungeons. And the corridors began to look older in their\nappearance, the architecture reverting back in time by centuries\ninto roughened stone held together by crude-looking mortar. She\nbegan to wonder if Professor Snape was taking her to the\nreal dungeons that she'd heard rumors of, the true\ndungeons of Hogwarts that had been sealed off to all but faculty;\nand if maybe Professor Snape did terrible things down there to\ninnocent helpless young girls but that was probably just wishful\nthinking on her part.",
      "They went down another flight of stairs, and came out into a\nroom that was no room at all, but an empty rock cavern with a\nsingle door, pierced by many dark openings and lit by a single\ntorch of ancient style that fired as they entered.",
      "Professor Snape took out his wand, then, and began to cast Charm\nafter Charm, she lost track of how many; and when the Potions\nMaster was done he turned back toward her, locked his intense eyes\non hers, and said in a level voice unlike his usual drawl, \"You\nwill say nothing to anyone of this matter, Miss Felthorne, nothing\nnow or ever. If that is acceptable to you, nod. If not, we will\nturn and go.\"",
      "She nodded, frightened and with a strange hope dawning in her\nheart (well, not exactly her heart).",
      "\"The task I have for you is very simple, Miss Felthorne,\" said\nProfessor Snape's toneless voice, \"and your extremely generous pay\nof fifty Galleons is merely to compensate you for being\nMemory-Charmed afterward.\"",
      "She drew an involuntary breath. Her family might be rich but\nthey had other daughters and kept her on a tight leash and it was\ncertainly a lot of money for her.",
      "Then her ears caught up with the words Memory-Charmed\nand for a moment she felt outraged, there was no point if she\ncouldn't keep the memories, what sort of girl did Professor Snape\nthink she was?",
      "\"You surely know,\" said Severus Snape, \"of Miss Hermione\nGranger, the Sunshine General?\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" said Rianne Felthorne in sudden horror and\ndisgust. \"She's in her first year! Ew!\u202f\""

      "The winter Sun had well set by the time dinner ended, and so it\nwas amid the peaceful light of stars twinkling down from the\nenchanted ceiling of the Great Hall that Hermione left for the\nRavenclaw Tower alongside her study partner Harry Potter, who\nlately seemed to have a ridiculous amount of time for\nstudying. She hadn't the faintest idea of when Harry was doing his\nactual homework, except that it was getting done, maybe by house\nelves while he slept.",
      "Nearly every single pair of eyes in the whole Hall lay on them\nas they passed through the mighty doors of the dining-room, which\nwere more like siege gates of a castle than anything students ought\nto go through on the way back from supper.",
      "They went out without speaking, and walked until the distant\nbabble of student conversation had faded into silence; and then the\ntwo of them went on a little further through the stone corridors\nbefore Hermione finally spoke.",
      "\"Why'd you do that, Harry?\"",
      "\"Do what?\" said the Boy-Who-Lived in an abstracted tone, as if\nhis mind were quite elsewhere, thinking about vastly more important\nthings.",
      "\"I mean, why didn't you just tell them no?\"",
      "\"Well,\" Harry said, as their shoes pattered across the tiles, \"I\ncan't just go around saying 'no' every time someone asks me about\nsomething I haven't done. I mean, suppose someone asks me, 'Harry,\ndid you pull the prank with the invisible paint?' and I say 'No'\nand then they say 'Harry, do you know who messed with the\nGryffindor Seeker's broomstick?' and I say 'I refuse to answer that\nquestion.' It's sort of a giveaway.\"",
      "\"And that's why,\" Hermione said carefully, \"you told\neveryone...\" She concentrated, rembering the exact words. \"That if\nhypothetically there was a conspiracy, you could not\nconfirm or deny that the true master of the conspiracy was Salazar\nSlytherin's ghost, and in fact you wouldn't even be able to admit\nthe conspiracy existed so people ought to stop asking you questions\nabout it.\"",
      "\"Yep,\" said Harry Potter, smiling slightly. \"That'll teach them\nto take hypothetical scenarios too seriously.\"",
      "\"And you told me not to answer anything -\"",
      "\"They might not believe you, if you deny it,\" said\nHarry. \"So it's better to say nothing, unless you want them to\nthink you're a liar.\"",
      "\"But -\" Hermione said helplessly. \"But - but now people think\nI'm doing things for Salazar Slytherin!\u202f\" The way\nthe Gryffindors had been looking at her - the way the\nSlytherins had been looking at her -",
      "\"It goes along with being a hero,\" Harry said. \"Have you seen\nwhat the Quibbler says about me?\u202f\"",
      "For a brief second Hermione imagined her parents reading a\nnewspaper article about her, and instead of the story being about\nher winning a nationwide spelling bee or any of the other ways\nshe'd imagined getting into the papers, the headline said \"HERMIONE\nGRANGER GETS DRACO MALFOY PREGNANT\".",
      "It was enough to make you think twice about the whole heroine\nbusiness.",
      "Harry's voice turned a bit more formal. \"Speaking of which, Miss\nGranger, how goes your latest quest?\"",
      "\"Well,\" said Hermione, \"unless the ghost of Salazar Slytherin\nreally does show up and tell us where to find bullies, I\ndon't think we're going to have much luck.\" Not that she was sorry\nabout that.",
      "She glanced over at Harry, and saw the boy giving her a\npeculiarly intense look.",
      "\"You know, Hermione,\" the boy said quietly, as though to make\nsure that nobody else in the world heard, \"I think you're right. I\nthink some people get a lot more help than others in becoming\nheroes. And I don't think that's fair, either.\"",
      "And Harry grabbed at her witch's robes where they lay over her\narm, and hustled her into a side-hall of the corridor they were\nwalking through, her mouth gaping open in surprise even as Harry's\nwand came into his hand, they rounded a curve of the side-hall and\nit was so narrow that it was almost pushing her and Harry into each\nother, even as Harry pointed to the way they'd come and softly said\n\"Quietus\", then a moment later, in the other direction,\n\"Quietus\" again.",
      "The boy looked searchingly around them, not just to every side,\nbut even upward toward the ceiling and down toward the floor.",
      "And then Harry stuck a hand in his pouch and said, \"Invisibility\ncloak.\"",
      "\"Gleep?\u202f\" said Hermione.",
      "Harry was already drawing out folds of shimmering black fabric\nfrom the mokeskin device. \"Don't worry,\" the boy said with a small\ngrin, \"they're so rare that nobody bothered to make a school rule\nagainst them...\"",
      "And then Harry held out the dark velvet mesh to her, and said,\nhis voice strangely formal, \"I do not give you, but loan you, my\ncloak, unto Hermione Jean Granger. Protect her well.\"",
      "She stared at the shimmering velvet of the cloak, cloth that\nswallowed all the light that fell on it except what glinted from\nsmall strange reflections, fabric so perfectly black it should've\nshown dust or lint or something but it didn't, the longer\nyou looked the more you felt like what you were seeing wasn't\nreally there at all, but then you blinked again and it was just a\nblack cloak.",
      "\"Take it, Hermione.\"",
      "Hardly even thinking, Hermione stretched out her hand to grasp\nthe fabric; and then just as her brain woke up and she started to\npull her hand back, Harry let go of the cloak and it started to\nfall and she grabbed at it without thinking. And the instant her\nfingers touched and held the cloak she felt an intangible jolt run\nthrough her like picking up her wand for the first time; and it was\nlike she heard a song being sung, ever so faintly, in the back of\nher mind.",
      "\"That's one of my quest items, Hermione,\" Harry said softly. \"It\nbelonged to my father, and it's not something I can replace, if\nit's lost. Don't loan it to anyone else, don't show it to anyone,\ndon't tell anyone it exists... but if you want to borrow it for a\nwhile, just come to me and ask.\"",
      "Hermione finally tore her eyes loose from the depthless black\nfolds and stared back up at Harry.",
      "\"I can't -\"",
      "\"You certainly can,\" Harry said. \"Because there's nothing even\nthe tiniest bit fair about my finding this gift-wrapped in a box\nnext to my bed one morning, and you... not.\" Harry paused\nthoughtfully. \"Unless you did get your own invisibility\ncloak, in which case never mind.\"",
      "Then the implications of invisibility cloak finally\ndawned on her, and she pointed a shocked finger at Harry, though\nthey were close enough together that she couldn't quite straighten\nher arm properly, and her voice rose with considerable indignation\nas she said, \"So that's how you disappeared from the\nPotions closet! And the time when -\" and then she trailed off,\nbecause even with an invisibility cloak she still couldn't\nsee how Harry had...",
      "Harry buffed his fingernails on his robes with artful\nnonchalance, and said, \"Well, you knew there had to be\nsome trick to it, right? And now the heroine will\nmysteriously know where and when to find bullies - just like she\nlistened to the bullies planning it, even though nobody her age\ncould possibly have turned herself invisible to spy on\nthem.\"",
      "There was a pause and a silence.",
      "\"Harry -\" she said. \"I'm - I'm not sure anymore that fighting\nbullies is such a good idea.\"",
      "Harry's eyes stayed steady on hers. \"Because the other girls\nmight get hurt?\"",
      "She nodded, just nodded.",
      "\"That's their choice, Hermione, just like it's yours.\nI decided not to do the obvious stupid thing that everyone\ndoes in books, try to keep you safe and protected and helpless, and\nhave you get really angry at me, and push me away while you go off\non your own and get into even more trouble, and then heroically\npull through it successfully, after which I'd finally have my\nepiphany and realize that blah blah blah etcetera. I know how that\npart of my life story goes, so I'm just skipping over it. If I can\npredict what I'm going to think later, I might as well go ahead and\nthink it now. Anyway, my point is, you shouldn't smother\nyour friends to keep them safe, either. Just tell them up\nfront it's predictably going to go horribly wrong, and if they\nstill want to be heroines after that, fine.\"",
      "It was at times like this that Hermione wondered if she was\never going to get used to the way Harry thought. \"Harry, I\nreally,\" her voice stuck for a second, \"really, really\ndon't want them getting hurt! Especially because of something I\nstarted!\"",
      "\"Hermione,\" Harry said seriously, \"I'm pretty sure you did the\nright thing. I don't see what could realistically happen to them\nthat would be worse for them, in the long run, than\nnot trying.\"",
      "\"What if they get badly hurt?\" Hermione said. Her voice\nfelt blocked in her throat; she remembered Captain Ernie saying how\nHarry had just stared straight into the eyes of a bully as the\nbully bent his finger back, before Professor Sprout had arrived to\nsave him; and there was another thought that came after that, about\nHannah and her delicate hands with the fingernails that she\ncarefully painted in Hufflepuff yellow every morning, but that\nwasn't allowed to be imagined. \"And then - they'll never do\nanything courageous, ever again -\"",
      "\"I don't think it works like that,\" Harry said steadily. \"Even\nif it all goes mind-bogglingly wrong, I don't think it works like\nthat inside a human mind. The important thing is believing about\nyourself that you're someone who can break your boundaries. Trying\nand getting hurt can't possibly be worse for you than being...\nstuck.\"",
      "\"What if you're wrong, Harry?\"",
      "Harry paused for a moment, and then shrugged a little sadly, and\nsaid, \"What if I'm right?\"",
      "Hermione looked back at the black mesh running over her hand.\nFrom the inside the cloak felt strangely soft and yet firm against\nher palm, as if it was trying to give her hand a reassuring\nhug.",
      "Then she lifted her arm back up, holding the cloak back to\nHarry.",
      "Harry didn't move to take it.",
      "\"I -\" said Hermione. \"I mean, thank you, thank you a lot, but\nI'm still thinking about it, so you can take it back for now.\nAnd... Harry, I don't think it's right to spy on people\n-\"",
      "\"Not even on known bullies, to rescue their victims?\" Harry\nsaid. \"I've never been bullied, but I've been through a\nrealistic simulation, and it didn't feel very pleasant. Have you\never been bullied, Hermione?\"",
      "\"No,\" she said in a quiet voice, and went on holding out Harry's\ninvisibility cloak to him.",
      "Finally Harry took back his cloak - she felt a small twitch of\nloss as the inaudible song vanished from the back of her mind - and\nstarted to stuff the black material back into his pouch.",
      "As the pouch ate the last of the fabric, Harry turned from her,\nto break the Quieting Barrier -",
      "\"And, um,\" Hermione said. \"That's not the Cloak of\nInvisibility, is it? The one we read about in the library on page\neighteen of Paula Vieira's translation of Gottschalk's An\nIllustrated Scroll of Lost Devices?\"",
      "Harry turned his head back, grinning slightly, and said in\nexactly the same tone of voice he'd used earlier with the other\nstudents at dinner, \"I cannot confirm or deny that I possess\nmagical artifacts of incredible power.\"",
      "When Hermione climbed into bed that night she was still trying\nto decide. Her life had been simpler at dinnertime, back when there\nhadn't been any practical way for them to find bullies;\nand now she had to choose again; not for herself, this time, but\nfor her friends. In her mind's eye she kept seeing Dumbledore's\nlined face and the pain it hadn't quite hidden, and in her mind's\nears she kept hearing Harry's voice saying 'That's their choice,\nHermione, just like it's yours.'",
      "And her hand kept remembering the sensation of the cloak against\nher fingers, replaying it over and over in her mind. There was a\npower to the feeling that compelled her thoughts to return to it,\nand to the song she'd heard / hadn't heard in a part of her mind\nand magic which now lay silent once more.",
      "Harry had spoken to the cloak like it was a person,\ntelling it to take good care of her. Harry had said the cloak had\nbelonged to his father, that he couldn't replace it if it was\nlost...",
      "But... Harry wouldn't really do that, would he?",
      "Just hand her one of the three Deathly Hallows created\ncenturies before Hogwarts?",
      "She could say that she felt flattered, but this went\nway beyond feeling flattered, into making her wonder just\nwhat she was to Harry, exactly.",
      "Maybe Harry was the sort of person who went around loaning\nancient lost magical artifacts to anyone he considered a\nfriend, but -",
      "But when she thought about which part of his life Harry\nhad said he'd skipped over, the part where he tried to keep her\nsafe and protected...",
      "Hermione stared up at the ceiling of the Ravenclaw dorm.\nSomewhere beyond her bed, Mandy and Su were talking. She'd turned\nup her Quieting Charm to where she couldn't hear the exact words,\nbut could still hear their faint murmur; there was something\ncomforting about sleeping in a dorm with the other girls. Harry\nkept his own Quieter turned up all the way, she knew.",
      "She was starting to wonder if maybe Harry actually did,\nwell...",
      "You know...",
      "Like her.",
      "It took Hermione Granger a long time to fall asleep that\nnight.",
      "And when she woke up the next morning there was a small slip of\nparchment peeking out from under her pillow which said At\nhalf-past ten you will find a bully in the fourth passageway to the\nleft of the hall leaving the Potions classroom - S.",
      "When Hermione entered the Great Hall that morning, her stomach\nwas filled with flying butterflies the size of Hippogriffs; even as\nshe approached the Ravenclaw breakfast table she still hadn't\ndecided what to do.",
      "There was an empty place next to Padma, she saw. That would be\nwhere to sit down, if she was going to tell Padma and then ask\nPadma to tell Daphne and Tracey.",
      "Hermione walked toward the empty place next to Padma.",
      "There were words waiting in her throat, Padma, I got a\nmysterious message -",
      "And she could feel a huge brick wall inside her, stopping the\nwords from coming out. She'd be putting Hannah and Susan and Daphne\nin danger. Taking them and leading them by the hand\nstraight into trouble. That was Wrong.",
      "Or she could just go try to handle the bully herself, without\ntelling her friends anything, and that, quite obviously, was also\nWrong.",
      "Hermione knew she was being faced with a Moral Dilemma, just\nlike all those wizards and witches she'd read about in stories.\nOnly in stories people always got a right choice and a\nwrong choice, not two wrong ones, which seemed a bit unfair. But\nshe had the sense, somehow - maybe it came from the way Harry\nalways talked about how the history books would see them - that she\nwas faced with a Heroic Decision, and that her whole life might end\nup going one way or another, depending on what she chose right now,\nthis morning.",
      "Hermione sat down at the table without looking to either side,\njust gazing at the plate and silverware like they might have\nanswers hidden inside, thinking as hard as she ever had, and a few\nseconds later she heard Padma's voice whispering almost in her ear,\n\"Daphne says she knows where a bully's going to be at ten-thirty\ntoday.\"",
      "Doomed.",
      "They were all doomed, in Susan Bones's opinion.",
      "Auntie sometimes told stories which started out like this,\npeople doing something they knew was stupid, and the\nstories usually ended with someone being doomed all over\nthe floor and all over the walls and getting on Auntie's shoes.",
      "\"Hey, Padma,\" muttered Parvati, her voice just barely audible\nover the soft impacts of eight girls tiptoeing through the corridor\nleading to the Potions classroom, \"d'you know why Hermione's been\nsighing all morning -\"",
      "\"No talking!\" hissed Lavender, the harsh whisper sounding much\nlouder than Parvati's mutter. \"You never know when Evil might be\nlistening!\"",
      "\"Shhh!\u202f\" said three other girls even more loudly.",
      "Utterly, totally, quite extremely doomed.",
      "As they approached the fourth passageway to the left of the\nPotions classroom, where Daphne's mysterious informant had said the\nbullying would take place, the eight of them moved slower, the\nsound of their feet got softer, and finally General Granger made\nthe gesture that meant Halt, I'll look ahead.",
      "Lavender raised a hand, then, and when Hermione turned to look\nat her, Lavender, looking puzzled, pointed straight down the\ncorridor, gestured to herself, and then tried to sign something\nelse that Susan didn't understand -",
      "General Granger shook her head, and once again, this time with\nslower, more exaggerated movements, made the sign for Halt,\nI'll look ahead.",
      "Lavender, looking even more puzzled, pointed back the way they'd\ncome, and made a bouncing gesture with her other hand.",
      "Now everyone else was looking even more confused than Lavender,\nand Susan thought with some acerbity that evidently one hour of\npractice done two days ago wasn't enough to remember a new set of\ncode signals.",
      "Hermione pointed at Lavender, then at the floor beneath\nLavender's feet, the expression on her face making it very clear\nthat the intended meaning was You. Stay. Here.",
      "Lavender nodded.",
      "Doom doom doom, went the words of the Chaos Legion's\nmarching song through Susan's mind, doom doom doom doom doom\ndoom...",
      "Hermione reached into her robes, and drew out a little rod with\na mirror on the end of it and an eyepiece. Very very softly indeed,\nthe Ravenclaw girl crept up to the wall, right next to where the\npassageway opened off the corridor, and peeked just the tip of the\neyepiece around the corner.",
      "Then a little more.",
      "Then a little more.",
      "Then General Granger cautiously stuck her head around the\nside.",
      "General Granger turned back to them, nodded, and made the hand\ngesture for follow me.",
      "Susan felt a little better as she crept forward. The part of the\nPlan which called for them to arrive thirty minutes before the\nbully had, apparently, actually worked. Maybe they were only\nslightly doomed...?",
      "At ten-twenty-nine, almost on the dot, the bully showed up. If\nanyone had been present to hear - though the corridor was\napparently empty - they would have heard his shoes clicking solidly\nthrough the main corridor, entering the passageway, walking toward\nwhere the passageway turned its first corner, turning that corner,\nand then stopping in some surprise upon seeing that the passageway\nnow terminated in a solid brick wall where no wall had been\nbefore.",
      "Then the bully shrugged and turned away, as he leaned back to\nwatch the main passage from just around the corner.",
      "It was the castle Hogwarts, after all.",
      "Behind the hastily Transfigured thin panels they'd assembled\ninto the outward appearance of a brick wall, the girls waited; not\nspeaking, not moving, hardly even breathing, but watching through\nthe eyeholes they'd left themselves.",
      "As Susan's gaze took in the bully, she could feel the tightening\nof her chest all the way into her toes. The boy looked to be in his\nseventh-year if not older, and his robes were trimmed in\ngreen instead of the red they'd been hoping for, and he had\nmuscles, and after staring for a bit longer, Susan\nrealized his stance had the balance that meant that he\ndueled.",
      "Then they all heard the sound of more feet approaching from the\ncorridor. The fourth-year Gryffindors and Slytherins had just been\nlet out of Potions class.",
      "The footsteps pattered past, and diminished and faded, and the\nbully didn't do anything. For a moment Susan felt an instant of\nrelief -",
      "Then another, smaller group of footsteps approached.",
      "The bully still didn't do anything, as the footsteps went\npast.",
      "That happened a few more times.",
      "And then, as there approached the faintly audible sound of one\nlast set of footsteps, the seven girls heard the bully's voice\nsaying, clear and cold and quiet, \"Protego\".",
      "Someone did gasp then, though fortunately very very\nquietly. If they couldn't get in even a single shot -",
      "The bullies were learning already, Susan realized, she\nhadn't expected S.P.H.E.W. to be able to do this very often before\nthe bullies caught on - but - Hermione had already defeated three\nbullies - and the school had been buzzing with speculation about\nSalazar Slytherin's ghost, yesterday -",
      "He's expecting us!",
      "Susan would have whispered to give up, to abort the plan, only\nthere was no way to convey a message to -",
      "\"Silencio,\" said the bully in a soft, deliberate voice\nwith his wand pointed toward the corridor, the blue haze of his\nShielding Charm shimmering around him. \"Accio victim.\"",
      "When the fourth-year boy came into their field of vision he was\ndangling upside down as if an invisible hand were holding him high\nby one leg, his red-trimmed robes beginning to slide down his\nthighs to reveal the pants beneath. His mouth was opening and\nclosing helpessly, no sound coming out.",
      "\"I suppose you're wondering what's going on,\" the seventh-year\nSlytherin said in a quiet, cold voice. \"Don't worry. It's so simple\neven a Gryffindor could understand.\"",
      "With that, the Slytherin's left hand formed a fist and drove\nhard into the Gryffindor's belly. The fourth-year boy's body jerked\naround frantically, but still no words left his mouth.",
      "\"You're my victim,\" said the older Slytherin. \"I'm a bully. I'm\ngoing to beat you up. And we'll see if anyone stops me.\"",
      "It was at that moment that Susan realized it was a trap.",
      "And in almost the same moment, there rang out the mighty and\nhigh-pitched voice of a young girl, crying, \"Stop, evildoer!\nFinite Incantatem!\u202f\"",
      "Lavender, thought Susan, agonized. The Gryffindor girl\nhad volunteered to be a distraction, while the rest of them\nexecuted a flank attack from where the bully wouldn't expect it,\nthat had been the plan, only now -",
      "\"In the name of Hogwarts,\" cried Lavender's voice, though they\ncouldn't see her, \"and in the name of heroines everywhere, I\ncommand you to let go of that EEK!\"",
      "\"Expelliarmus,\" said the bully. \"Stupefy.\nAccio stupid heroine.\"",
      "When Lavender floated into their vision, dangling by one foot\nand unconscious, Susan blinked; the girl was dressed in a bright\ncrimson-and-gold skirt and blouse, instead of her usual Hogwarts\nrobes.",
      "The bully was also giving the girl's upside-down body an odd\nlook, and then he pointed his wand at her and said \"Finite\nIncantatem,\" but the clothes stayed the same.",
      "Then the bully shrugged, and, still facing in the direction of\nLavender instead of the dangling fourth-year boy, drew back his\nfist -",
      "\"Lagann!\u202f\" yelled five voices, and five green spirals\nblasted from five wands aimed through five holes in the false wall,\nand an instant later Hermione's voice shouted\n\"Stupefy!\u202f\"",
      "Five green spirals shattered ineffectually on blue haze, and\nHermione's red bolt bounced off the haze and struck the fourth-year\nboy, who jerked and then was still.",
      "And the seventh-year bully turned around, smiling grimly, as the\nfirst-year girls screamed and charged.",
      "Susan's eyes flew open and instantly she was rolling away from\nwhere she'd lain on the floor, her lungs still on fire and her\nwhole body still aching from when she'd been hit, the battle had\nonly moved forward a few seconds from what she could see, Hannah's\nbody falling with her arm still stretched out toward Susan,\n\"Glisseo!\u202f\" shouted Hermione but the older boy just\nslashed his wand down leaving a trail of green glow behind and\nHermione's Charm visibly disrupted into a shower of blue-white\nsparks, then in almost the same motion the bully said\n\"Stupefy!\u202f\" and Hermione was blown backward and Susan\nsummoned up all the magic she had left and shouted\n\"Innervate!\u202f\" at Hermione's body even as the bully turned\ntoward her, the bully's wand pointed in her direction again and\nthen Padma yelled \"Prismatis!\u202f\" just before the bully\nshouted \"Impedimenta!\u202f\", the rainbow sphere forming\naround the bully and the seventh-year Slytherin staggered\nas his own hex was reflected back at him, but an instant later the\nbully's wand swept back to tap himself and then Padma's Prismatic\nSphere shattered like a blown soap bubble as the bully's wand cut\nthrough it and \"Innervate!\u202f\" yelled Parvati at Hannah's\nbody and Tracey and Lavender screamed at the same time,\n\"Wingardium Leviosa!\u202f\" -",
      "Hannah Abbott held out her wand with a hand that trembled with\nexhaustion, she didn't have enough magic left for even one\nInnervate, now.",
      "The rest of the passageway was silent, scattered bodies lying\nacross the ground, Padma and Tracey and Lavender, Hermione and\nParvati in a heap against one wall, Susan standing in petrified\nrigor as her eyes tracked it all helplessly, even the Gryffindor\nboy lying sprawled and motionless (Hermione had woken him and he'd\nfought, but it hadn't been enough).",
      "It had been a very short battle.",
      "The bully was still smiling, the only signs of his exertion a\nwavering ripple in the blue glow surrounding him, and a few beads\nof sweat on his forehead.",
      "The bully raised his arm, wiped the sweat off his forehead, and\nstalked toward her like a man-shaped living Lethifold.",
      "Hannah turned and fled, spun and ran with screams kept bound in\nher choking throat, sprinted past the fallen paneling of the fake\nbrick wall, ran down the passageway with all the speed she could\nmuster, weaving as much as she could -",
      "Just before Hannah got to the turn in the passageway, the\nbully's voice from behind her said \"Cluthe!\u202f\" and she got\nawful cramps all through her legs, she fell down and slid and hit\nher head against the wall, only she didn't even notice the pain of\nthe smack as she started to scream with the twisting muscles -",
      "The bully was still stalking toward her, Hannah saw as she\nturned her head; approaching her slowly, still wearing that\ndreadful smile.",
      "And she rolled, despite the pain as her leg muscles knotted up\naround themselves, she rolled around the corner of the passageway,\nand screamed, \"Go away!\u202f\"",
      "\"I think not,\" said the bully, his voice deep and scary like\nthat of a grown man, sounding very close at hand now.",
      "The bully walked around the corner and Daphne Greengrass stabbed\nher Most Ancient Blade directly into his groin.",
      "There was a flash that lit up the whole corridor -",
      "It was with a subdued mien that seven girls left Madam Pomfrey's\noffice, leaving one of their own behind in a hospital bed.",
      "Hannah would be all right in about thirty-five minutes, the\nhealer had said; torn muscles were easy to mend.",
      "Daphne had done all the talking, and according to her, Hannah\nhad suffered a mishap with a Road-Running Charm which had caused\nthe leg cramps. Madam Pomfrey had given them a sharp look but\nhadn't argued, even though that Charm was around six years above\ntheir level.",
      "Madam Pomfrey had also given Daphne a potion to help with her\nstate of total magical exhaustion, and warned her not to cast any\nspells for the next three hours. That, supposedly, was from Daphne\nusing up too much magic trying to Finite Hannah, rather\nthan the Most Ancient Blade drawing out all of her power to break\nthe Protego.",
      "The rest of them had decided not to say anything about the\nbruises under their robes until they could get some older girls to\ncast Episkey. There were limits to what Daphne could talk\naround.",
      "The whole thing, Susan thought, had been too close, much too\nclose. If the bully had so much as looked around the corner - if\nhe'd taken a moment to recast his Shielding Charm -",
      "\"We should stop,\" said Susan, as soon as the seven of them had\ngotten out of hearing range of the healer's office. \"We should stop\ndoing this.\"",
      "For some reason, then, even though they were supposed to vote on\nthis sort of thing, everyone turned to look at General Granger.",
      "The Sunshine General didn't seem to see them looking at her, she\njust strode on, gazing off straight ahead.",
      "After a little while, Hermione Granger said, in a voice that\nsounded thoughtful and a little sad, \"Hannah said she\ndidn't want us to stop. I'm not sure it's right for us to... be\nless brave for her, than she is.\"",
      "All the other girls, except Susan, nodded at that.",
      "\"I think that's got to be as bad as it gets,\" said Parvati. \"And\nwe can handle it. We've proved that now.\"",
      "Susan couldn't think of anything to say to that. She didn't\nthink that shrieking at the top of her lungs about blatant\nstupidity and DOOM would be persuasive. And she couldn't just\nleave the other girls, either. Wasn't it enough to be\ncursed with hard work, why did Hufflepuffs have to be\nloyal on top of everything else?",
      "\"By the way, Lavender,\" said Padma. \"What in the name of\nMerlin's underpants were you wearing back there?\"",
      "\"My hero outfit,\" said the Gryffindor girl.",
      "Daphne sounded weary, as she spoke without turning her own head\nfrom where she was plodding through the hall. \"It's the costume of\nthe Soldier of Gryffindor from the play Chronicles of the\nLunarian Soldiers.\"",
      "\"Did you Transfigure it?\" said Parvati, looking puzzled. \"But\nthe bully cast Finite on you -\"",
      "\"Nope!\" Lavender said. \"It's real! See, I just\nTransfigured my hero outfit into a regular shirt and skirt\nbeforehand, so all I had to do was cast Finite on\nmyself after I saw the bully. Do you want your own, Parvati? I got\nmine made yesterday by Katarina and Joshua in sixth-year, for\ntwelve Sickles -\"",
      "\"I think,\" General Granger said in a careful voice, \"that would\nmake us all look a little silly.\"",
      "\"Well,\" said Lavender, \"we should vote on whether to -\"",
      "\"I think,\" General Granger said, \"that no matter what\nanyone votes, I'm not going to be caught dead\nwearing one of those costumes -\"",
      "Susan ignored the argument. She was trying to think up some sort\nof clever strategy for being less doomed.",
      "The whole Great Hall went silent, even if only for a moment, as\nthe seven of them walked into lunch.",
      "Then the applause started.",
      "It was scattered, not the massive applause of everyone\napplauding at once. A lot of it came from the Gryffindor table,\nless from Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw, and none from Slytherin.",
      "Daphne felt her face tightening. She'd hoped - well,\nmaybe after they found a Gryffindor bully to stop and a Slytherin\nto rescue, her fellow Slytherins would realize -",
      "She looked at the Hufflepuff table.",
      "Neville Longbottom was applauding with his hands held high above\nhis head, although he wasn't smiling. Maybe he'd heard about\nHannah, or maybe he was wondering why Hannah wasn't there.",
      "Then, not quite able to help herself, she glanced toward the\nHead Table.",
      "Professor Sprout's face was lined with concern. She and\nProfessor McGonagall were leaning their heads toward Headmaster\nDumbledore, who had a solemn look, and all their lips were moving\nquickly. Professor Flitwick looked more resigned than anything\nelse, and Quirrell, face slack, was taking trembling stabs at his\nsoup using a spoon gripped in a fist.",
      "Professor Snape was looking directly at -",
      "Her?",
      "Or - at Hermione Granger, standing next to her?",
      "A small, thin smile crossed the Potions Master's face, and he\nraised his hands, brought them together once in a motion that was\ntoo slow to be a real clap; and then the Potions Master turned back\nto his plate, ignoring the conversations around him.",
      "Daphne felt a little chill go down her spine, and she hastily\nturned to walk toward the Slytherin table. Susan and Lavender and\nParvati peeled off from their group, heading toward the Hufflepuff\nand Gryffindor tables on the other side of the Great Hall.",
      "It happened as they were passing the part of the Slytherin table\nwhere the Slytherin Quidditch team sat.",
      "That was when Hermione stumbled suddenly, stumbled hard\nlike she was being yanked off her feet, and went sprawling into the\ngap between where Marcus Flint and Lucian Bole sat, and there was a\nsad little splutching sound as Hermione's face ended up in Flint's\nplate of steak and mashed potatoes.",
      "Everything seemed to happen too quickly then, or maybe it was\njust Daphne herself who was thinking too slow, as Flint let out a\nbellow of indignation and his hand yanked Hermione back and threw\nher into the Ravenclaw table, and she bounced off a student's back\nand collapsed onto the ground -",
      "The quiet spread out in ripples.",
      "Hermione pushed herself up on her hands, though she didn't get\nall the way to her feet, Daphne could see that her whole body was\nshaking, and that her face was still covered with mashed potatoes\nwith scattered pieces of steak.",
      "For a long moment, nobody spoke, nobody moved. Like nobody in\nthe whole Great Hall could imagine, any more than Daphne could,\nwhat happened next.",
      "Then Flint's powerful voice, the voice of the Slytherin Captain\nthat bellowed commands on the Quidditch pitch, said in a dangerous\nrumble, \"You ruined my food, girl.\"",
      "Another moment of frozen silence. Hermione's head - Daphne could\nsee it trembling - turned to look at the Slytherin Quidditch\nCaptain.",
      "\"Apologize to me,\" said Flint.",
      "Harry Potter started to push himself up from the Ravenclaw\ntable, and then stopped abruptly, halfway to his feet, as if he'd\njust thought of something -",
      "Then five other people stood up from the Ravenclaw table.",
      "All of the Slytherin Quidditch team stood up, their wands coming\ninto their hands, and then students stood up at the Gryffindor\ntable and at the Hufflepuff table and without thinking Daphne\nturned to look at the Head Table and she saw that the Headmaster\nwas still sitting down, watching, just watching, Dumbledore was\njust watching and he had one hand out as though to\nrestrain Professor McGonagall - in just one second someone would\nshout a spell and then it would be too late, why wasn't the\nHeadmaster doing anything -",
      "And a voice said, \"My apologies.\"",
      "Daphne turned back to look, her mouth gaping open in absolute\nshock.",
      "\"Scourgify,\" said that smooth voice, and the mashed\npotatoes vanished from Hermione's face, revealing the Ravenclaw's\nsurprised expression as Draco Malfoy approached her, sheathed his\nwand again, and then knelt to one knee beside her and offered her a\nhand.",
      "\"Sorry about that, Miss Granger,\" said Draco Malfoy's polite\nvoice. \"I guess someone thought they were being funny.\"",
      "Hermione took Draco's hand, and Daphne suddenly realized what\nwas about to happen -",
      "But Draco Malfoy didn't raise Hermione halfway up and\nthen drop her.",
      "He just pulled her to her feet.",
      "\"Thanks,\" said Hermione.",
      "\"You're welcome,\" Draco Malfoy said in a loud voice, not looking\nto either side to see where all four Houses of Hogwarts were\nstaring at him in total shock. \"Just remember, being cunning and\nambitious doesn't mean you have to be like that.\"",
      "And then Draco Malfoy went back to his seat at the Slytherin\nbench and sat down like he hadn't - he hadn't just - he'd\njust -",
      "Hermione went to the nearest empty place at the Ravenclaw bench\nand sat down.",
      "A number of other people, rather slowly, sat down.",
      "\"Daphne?\" said Tracey. \"Are you all right?\"",
      "Draco's heart was hammering in his chest so hard he worried it\nmight explode right out of his chest in a shower of blood, like\nthat curse Amycus Carrow had used once on a puppy.",
      "Draco's face stayed completely controlled, because he knew (it'd\nbeen drilled into him over and over) that if he showed the\nslightest sign of the fear he was feeling, his Housemates would rip\nhim apart like a swarm of Acromantulas.",
      "There'd been no time to check with Harry Potter, no time to\nplot, no time to think, just the instant of realizing that the time\nto start rescuing Slytherin's reputation was right\nthen.",
      "From all sides of the long Slytherin table, angry faces stared\nat Draco.",
      "But they were outnumbered by the faces that just looked\npuzzled.",
      "\"All right, I give up,\" said a sixth-year boy that Draco didn't\nrecognize, sitting across from him and two places to his right.\n\"Why did you do that, Malfoy?\"",
      "Although his mouth was very dry, Draco didn't swallow. That\nwould have been a sign of fear. Instead he took a bite of carrots,\nwhich had the most moisture of anything on his plate, and chewed\nand swallowed, thinking as rapidly as he could.",
      "\"You know,\" Draco said, making his voice as cutting as he could\n- as his heart thumped even harder in his chest, as everyone around\nhim stopped talking to listen - \"there's probably some way\nto make Slytherin look even worse than attacking eight\nfirst-year girls from all four Houses who are working together to\nstop bullies, but I can't think of how. This way we get\nthe benefit of what Greengrass is doing.\"",
      "The puzzled faces stayed puzzled.",
      "\"What?\" said the sixth-year boy, and \"Wait, what\nbenefit?\" said a fifth-year girl sitting to his right.",
      "\"It makes Slytherin House look better,\" said Draco.",
      "The Slytherins around him were giving him quizzical gazes like\nhe'd just tried to explain algebra.",
      "\"Look better to who?\u202f\" said the sixth-year boy.",
      "\"But you just helped a mudblood,\" said the fifth-year\ngirl. \"How's that supposed to look good?\"",
      "Draco's throat closed up. His brain was experiencing a hideous\nmalfunction during which it couldn't think of anything to say\nexcept the truth -",
      "Then, \"It's probably some kind of tremendously clever scheme\nMalfoy's got going,\" said a fifth-year boy. \"You know, like in\nThe Tragedy of Light, where everything that looks like a\nsetback is part of the plot. And it ends with Granger's head on a\nstick and nobody suspecting that it was him.\"",
      "\"That makes sense,\" someone said from further down the\ntable, and there was a lot of nodding.",
      "\"Do you know what the boss's up to?\" Vincent muttered\nin an undertone.",
      "Gregory Goyle didn't reply. In his mind he could hear very\nclearly his master's voice, saying, I can't believe I believed\nevery word of that, the day the rumor had started about\nSalazar Slytherin showing Potter and Granger where to find\nbullies.",
      "\"Mr. Goyle?\" whispered Vincent.",
      "Gregory Goyle's lips shaped the words, Oh no, but no\nsound came out.",
      "Hermione had left lunch early that day, for some reason she\nhadn't felt hungry. Those few seconds of horrible humiliation had\nkept burning through her mind, over and over, the feeling of her\nface squishing into the mashed potatoes and then being thrown\nthrough the air and then the Slytherin's boy's voice saying\n'Apologize to me'... it might have been the first time in her whole\nlife that she'd felt like hating someone. The boy who'd\nthrown her (Marcus Flint, they'd said his name was) and whoever had\ncast the tripping Jinx on her in the first place... she'd felt it,\nfor one horrible instant she'd wanted to go tell Harry that if he\nstarted getting creative on her behalf, she wouldn't\nobject.",
      "She hadn't been a minute out of the Great Hall before she'd\nheard the sound of running feet behind, and turned to see Daphne\nracing toward her.",
      "And listened to what her Sunshine Soldier had to say...",
      "\"Don't you understand?\u202f\" Daphne's voice was barely\nbelow a shriek. \"Just because someone's nice to you doesn't mean\nthey're your friend! He's Draco Malfoy! His father's a\nDeath Eater, all the parents of all his friends are Death Eaters -\nNott, Goyle, Crabbe, everyone around him, do you get it?\nThey all despise Muggleborns, they want everyone like you\nto die, they think you're good for nothing but being a\nsacrifice in horrible Dark rituals! Draco is the next\nLord Malfoy, he's been raised from birth to hate you and he's\nbeen raised from birth to lie!\u202f\" Daphne's gray-green eyes\nstared fiercely at her, demanding assent and understanding.",
      "\"He -\" Hermione said falteringly. She remembered the rooftop,\nthe awful jolt as she started to fall, Draco Malfoy's hand grabbing\nhers and holding it so hard that she'd had bruises afterward. She'd\nhad to tell him twice before he finally let her fall. \"Maybe Draco\nMalfoy isn't like them -\"",
      "Daphne's whisper was almost a scream. \"If he doesn't\nend up doing you ten times as hard as he just helped you, his\nlife is over, do you understand? I mean Lucius\nMalfoy would literally disinherit him! D'you know what the\nchance is that he's not up to something?\"",
      "\"Tiny?\" said Hermione in a small voice.",
      "\"Zero!\u202f\" hissed Daphne. \"I mean none! I mean\nless than zero! I mean the chance is so small that you\ncouldn't find it with three Magnifying Charms and a Point-Me spell\nand - and - and an ancient map and a centaur prophet! Everyone in\nSlytherin knows he's plotting to do something to you and doesn't\nwant to be suspected, I heard someone say he was seen pointing his\nwand at you just before you tripped - don't you see?\nThis is all part of Malfoy's plan!\u202f\"",
      "Draco sat eating his steak with roasted cauliflower florets and\nAshwinder sauce (it wasn't made from real Ashwinder eggs, it just\ntasted like fire), trying not to laugh and trying not to cry.",
      "He'd heard about plausible deniability, but hadn't\nrealized how much it mattered until he found that Malfoys didn't\nhave any.",
      "\"You want to know my plot?\" said Draco. \"Here's my\nplot. I'm not going to do anything and then the\nnext time people think I'm plotting something, they won't\nbe sure.\"",
      "\"Huh...\" said the fifth-year boy. \"I don't think I believe you,\nthat doesn't sound cunning enough to be really it -\"",
      "\"That's what he wants you to think,\" said the\nfifth-year girl.",
      "\"Albus,\" Minerva said dangerously, \"did you plan all\nthis?\"",
      "\"Well, if I did snap my fingers under the table, I\nwouldn't just tell you that -\"",
      "The Defense Professor's quavering hand dropped his spoon into\nthe soup again.",
      "\"What do you mean, set you up?\u202f\" said Millicent. The\ntwo of them were sitting cross-legged on Daphne's bed, having come\nthere straight from the Great Hall after lunch. \"With my Seer's\neyes that stare through Time Itself, I saw you\nwinning.\"",
      "Daphne stared at Millicent, her own merely mortal eyes rather\nnarrowed at the moment. \"That boy was expecting us.\"",
      "\"Well, yeah!\" said Millicent. \"Everyone knows you're hunting\nbullies!\"",
      "\"Hannah got hit by a really painful hex,\" Daphne said. \"She had\nto visit a healer, Millicent! If we're friends you should've\nwarned me!\"",
      "\"Look, Daphne, I told you -\" The Slytherin girl paused,\nas if trying to remember something, and then said, \"I mean, I told\nyou, what I See has to come to pass. If I try to change\nit, if anyone tries to change it, really terrible, awful,\nno good, extremely bad things will happen. And then it'll come to\npass anyway. If I See you getting beaten up, I\ncan't tell you that, because then you'd try to not\ngo, and then -\" Millicent stopped.",
      "\"And then?\" Daphne said skeptically. \"I mean, what happens if we\njust don't go?\"",
      "\"I don't know!\u202f\" said Millicent. \"But it probably makes\nbeing eaten by Lethifolds look like a tea party!\"",
      "\"Look, even I know that's not how prophecies work,\" Daphne said,\nthen paused. \"At least prophecies don't work like that in plays...\"\nAdmittedly, there were all sorts of tragedies where trying to avoid\na prophecy made it happen, or where, on the other hand,\ntrying to go along with a prophecy was the only reason why\nit happened. But you could make prophecies happen your own\nway if you were clever enough; or someone who loved you enough\ncould take your place; or with enough effort it was possible to\nbreak a prophecy outright... Then again, in plays the Seers never\nremembered what they Saw, either...",
      "Millicent must have seen Daphne's hesitation, because the other\ngirl started looking a little more confident. \"Well,\" Millicent\nsaid sharply, \"this isn't a play! Look, I'll tell you if I See it\nbeing a hard battle or an easy one. But that's all I can\ndo, you understand? And if I say 'hard' you can't not show\nup! Or - or -\" Millicent's eyes rolled back in her head, and she\nintoned hollowly, \"Those who try to cheat their destinies will\ncome to sad and gloomy ends -\"",
      "Professor Sprout shook her head, her face looking tight.",
      "\"But -\" said Susan. \"But you helped Harry Potter that\none time -\"",
      "\"And it was made quite clear to me,\" Professor Sprout\nsaid in a voice that sounded like someone was using a Shrinking\nCharm to squeeze her throat, \"that it was Professor Snape's job,\nand not mine, to keep order in Slytherin House - Miss Bones,\nplease, you don't have to do this if -\"",
      "\"Yes, I do have to,\" Susan said unhappily. \"I'm a\nHufflepuff, we have to be loyal.\"",
      "\"A mysterious parchment under your pillow?\" said Harry Potter,\nlooking up from where he was sitting, in the Quieted nook where\nthey were studying. Then the boy's green eyes narrowed. \"It wasn't\nfrom Santa Claus, was it?\"",
      "Pause.",
      "\"Okay,\" said Hermione. \"I'm not going to ask, and\nyou're not going to tell me, and we're both going\nto pretend you never said that and I don't know anything about it\n-\"",
      "Susan approached the table as soon as the older girl was alone,\nglancing around the Hufflepuff common room to make sure nobody was\nwatching (the way Auntie had taught her to do it, so that it\nwouldn't be obvious that she was looking).",
      "\"Hey, Susie,\" said the seventh-year Hufflepuff. \"Do you already\nneed more -\"",
      "\"Can I please talk to you privately for a bit?\" Susan said.",
      "Jaime Astorga, seventh-year of Slytherin, and until recently\nconsidered a promising upstart on the youth dueling circuit, stood\nramrod straight in Professor Snape's office, with his teeth\nclenched tight and sweat trickling down his spine.",
      "\"I distinctly recall,\" said the Head of his House in a sardonic\ndrawl, \"that I warned you, and a number of others this very\nmorning, that there were certain first-year girls who might prove\nannoying, if a fighter were incautious and allowed himself\nto be taken by surprise.\"",
      "Professor Snape stalked in a slow circle around him.",
      "\"I -\" said Jaime, as more sweat beaded on his forehead. He knew\nhow ridiculous it sounded, how much of a pathetic excuse. \"Sir,\nthey shouldn't have been able to -\" One first-year-girl shouldn't\nhave been able to break his Protego, no matter what sort\nof ancient Charm she used - Greengrass must have had help\n-",
      "But it was very clear that his Head of House wouldn't believe\nthat.",
      "\"Oh, I quite agree,\" murmured Snape in a low tone, instinct with\nmenace. \"They shouldn't have. I begin to wonder if Mr. Malfoy,\nwhatever his plotting, has a point, Astorga. It cannot be good for\nthe repute of Slytherin's House if our fighters, rather than\ndemonstrating their strength, lose to little girls!\" Snape's voice\nhad risen. \"It is well that you had the good taste to be defeated\nby a little girl who is a fellow Slytherin of a Noble House,\nAstorga, or I would deduct points from you myself!\"",
      "Jaime Astorga's fists clenched at his side, but he couldn't\nthink of a thing to say.",
      "It was some time before Jaime Astorga was allowed to leave the\npresence of his Head of House.",
      "And afterward, only the walls, the floor, and the ceiling saw\nSeverus Snape's smile.",
      "That evening Draco was visited by his father's owl, Tanaxu, who\nwasn't green but only because there weren't such things as green\nowls. The best Father had been able to find was an owl of the\npurest silver feathers, with great luminous green eyes, and a beak\nas sharp and cruel as any snake's fang. The parchment wrapped\naround Tanaxu's leg was short and to the point:",
      "What are you doing, my son?",
      "The parchment that Draco sent back was equally short, and it\nsaid,",
      "I am trying to stop harm done to Slytherin's reputation,\nfather.",
      "In as much time as it took for an owl to fly from Hogwarts to\nMalfoy Manor and back again, the family owl bore another message to\nDraco, and this one said only:",
      "What are you really doing?",
      "Draco stared at the parchment he'd unwrapped from the owl's leg.\nHis hands trembled, as he held up the parchment to the light of his\nfireplace. Five words, carved in black ink, shouldn't have been\nscarier than death.",
      "There wasn't very much time to think. Father knew exactly how\nlong it took for a message to go from Malfoy Manor to Hogwarts and\nback again; he would know if Draco delayed to compose a careful\nlie.",
      "But Draco still waited until his hand stopped trembling, before\nhe wrote his reply, the only answer he'd thought of that Father\nmight accept.",
      "I am preparing for the next war.",
      "Draco wrapped that parchment around the owl's leg and tied it,\nand then sent Tanaxu winging out from his room, through the halls\nof Hogwarts, into the night.",
      "He waited, but no reply came."

      "The red jet of fire took Hannah full in the face, flipping\nher end-over-heels and smacking her head straight into the stone\nwall, where her pale face seemed to linger for an instant, framed\nby flying strands of brown-golden hair, before she collapsed to the\nground in a heap of robes, as the third and final volley of blazing\ngreen spirals brought down their foe's Shield Charm.",
      "The March days marched by, filled with lectures and study and\nhomework, breakfast and lunch and dinner.",
      "The Gryffindor boy stared at the eight of them, tension in\nevery line of his body's frame, his face working soundlessly; and\nthen his hands released their clenched grasp on the Slytherin boy's\nlapels, and he walked away without anyone saying a word. (Well,\nLavender almost said a word - her mouth was just opening in\nindignation, maybe because she hadn't gotten a chance to declaim\nher speech - but luckily Hermione spotted it and made the gesture\nthat meant SHUT UP.)",
      "Then there was sleeping, of course. You wouldn't want to forget\nabout sleeping just because it seemed so normal.",
      "\"Innervate!\" said the young voice of Susan Bones, and\nHermione's eyes flew open and her lips drew in air with a gasp, her\nlungs feeling heavy like there was a huge weight resting on her\nchest. Beside her, Hannah was already sitting up, holding her head\nin her hands and grimacing. Daphne had warned them that this would\nbe a 'hard' fight, creating a certain trepidation in Hermione, and\nindeed in all of them. Except maybe Susan, who'd just shown up at\nthe appointed meeting-time, and walked alongside them without\nspeaking, and fought the seventh-year bully until she was the last\ngirl standing. Maybe the Gryffindor had been reluctant to fight the\nlast daughter of Bones, or maybe Susan had just gotten very lucky;\nat any rate, when Hermione had tried to sit up again, she'd\nrealized that her chest had felt heavy because there was, in fact,\na rather large body sprawled on top of her.",
      "And you wouldn't want to forget about magic either, even if the\nactual moment of casting a spell only formed a very small part of\nyour day. It was the whole point of Hogwarts, after all.",
      "\"Okay, how about if we all ride around on skateboards?\" said\nLavender. \"We could get places faster than walking. And we'd look\nreally awesome on skateboards, Muggle artifacts may not be as fast\nas broomsticks but they look cooler - we should vote on it\n-\"",
      "As for the remaining fractions of time, you would fill that\naccording to your nature: gossip about upper-year romances, or\nbooks and study sessions.",
      "Hermione reached out a trembling hand to grasp her copy\nof Hogwarts: A History from where it had fallen, the\never-comforting book only a pace distant from where she herself had\nended up on the floor, after the red-robed upper-year girl had\n\"bumped\" her into a wall. And then the older Gryffindor witch had\nwalked away without a look back, only a whispered \"Salazar's -\" and\na word that hurt her more than anything the Slytherins said about\nmudbloods, 'mudblood' was just a strange wizarding word but\nHermione knew the word the Gryffindor had said. She couldn't get\nused to it, she just couldn't get used to being hated. It still\nhurt just as much every time it happened, and somehow it hurt even\nmore coming from the Gryffindors who were supposed to be\nthe good ones.",
      "Harry had divided up eight of his soldiers among the other\narmies, as ordered; he'd voluntarily given up two Chaotic\nLieutenants, sending Dean Thomas to Dragon Army and then trading\nSeamus Finnigan to her for Blaise Zabini, who Harry had said was\nbeing \"underutilized\" in Sunshine. Lavender had elected to join\nmost of SPHEW in Sunshine; Tracey had decided to stay with\nChaos.",
      "\"So you can work your charms on General Potter?\" said\nLavender, as Hermione ignored both of them as hard as she could.\n\"I've got to say, Traces, I think our Sunshine General has him\npretty well sewn up by now - you'd have better luck convincing\nHermione that the three of you should have one of those, you know,\narrangements -\"",
      "Nobody had figured out yet what Draco Malfoy was plotting.",
      "\"Certain?\" said Harry Potter, sounding rather reluctant.\n\"You know a rationalist isn't ever certain of anything, Hermione,\nnot even that two and two make four. I can't actually read Malfoy's\nmind, and if I could, I couldn't be certain he wasn't a perfect\nOcclumens. All I can say is that based on what I've seen of Malfoy,\nit's a lot more plausible than Daphne Greengrass thinks, that he\nactually is trying to show the Slytherins a better way. We\nshould... we really should try to go along with that,\nHermione.\"",
      "(Well, Harry seemed to think Draco Malfoy was a good guy. But\nthen the trouble was that Harry also tended to trust people like\nProfessor Quirrell.)",
      "\"Professor Quirrell,\" Harry said, \"I'm worried about the hatred\nSlytherin House seems to be developing for Hermione Granger.\"",
      "They were sitting in the Defense Professor's office, Harry\nsitting far back from the teacher's desk (and the sense of pending\ndisaster was still noticeable, even then), the empty bookcase still\nframing Professor Quirrell's balding head. The cup balanced on\nHarry's thigh was filled with Professor Quirrell's obscure,\nprobably-expensive Chinese tea, and it said something about the way\nHarry had been thinking lately that he'd needed to make a conscious\ndecision to drink it.",
      "\"And this concerns me for what reason?\" said Professor Quirrell,\nsipping his tea.",
      "\"Yes, well,\" said Harry, \"I'm just going to ignore that - oh,\nstop that, Professor Quirrell, you've been plotting to\nrestore Slytherin House's reputation since at least the first\nFriday of this year.\"",
      "There might have been a tiny crack of a smile, at the edges of\nthose thin pale lips; and then again, there might not have been. \"I\nthink Slytherin's House will do well enough in the end, Mr. Potter,\nregardless of the fate of one girl. But I do agree that the present\noutlook is not favorable for your little friend. The bullies of two\nHouses, many of them with powerful and well-connected families, see\nMiss Granger as a threat to their reputation and a shame to their\npride. As powerful a motive as that is to hurt her, it pales\ncompared to the raw envy of the Gryffindors, who see an outsider\ngaining the laurels of heroism which they have dreamed of since\nchildhood.\" Now the smile on Professor Quirrell's lips was\ndefinite, though slight. \"And then there are those of Slytherin\nHouse who hear that Salazar Slytherin's ghost has abandoned them to\nfavor a mudblood. I wonder if you can even conceive, Mr. Potter, of\nhow such as they would react? Those who do not believe it would\ncheerfully kill Miss Granger for the insult. And as for those\nSlytherins who wonder deep down, in some quiet place within\nthemselves, if it might perhaps be true... their inner\npanic is something scarcely to be contemplated.\" Professor Quirrell\nsipped his tea equably. \"When you are more experienced, Mr. Potter,\nyou will see such consequences in advance of your plotting. As it\nstands, you are being ill-served by your willful ignorance of all\nhuman nature you deem unpleasant.\"",
      "Harry sipped his own tea.",
      "\"Ah...\" said Harry. \"Professor Quirrell... help?\"",
      "\"I already offered Miss Granger my help,\" said Professor\nQuirrell, \"as soon as I foresaw what would develop. My student told\nme, in polite terms, to stay out of her business. Nor would she\ntell you anything different, I expect. As I have little to truly\ngain or lose in this matter, I hardly intend to press the point.\"\nThe Defense Professor shrugged, his teacup held steady in the\nexactly-right polite grip, so that the surface of the liquid did\nnot even ripple as Professor Quirrell leaned back within his chair.\n\"Do not worry too much, Mr. Potter. Emotions run high around Miss\nGranger, but she is in less danger than you might imagine. When you\nare older, you will learn that the first and foremost thing which\nany ordinary person does is nothing.\"",
      "The envelope which the Slytherin System had delivered to Daphne\nat lunch was unsigned, as always; the parchment within named a time\nand a place and said, simply, \"Hard.\"",
      "That wasn't what had concerned Daphne. What had concerned Daphne\nwas that Millicent didn't seem to be looking in her or Tracey's\ndirection at lunch that day. She'd just stared straight ahead at\nher plate and eaten. Millicent had looked up just once that Daphne\nsaw, in the direction of the Hufflepuff table, and then looked\nquickly back down again; though Daphne was too far away to see the\nexpression on Millicent's face, since Millicent had sat down far\naway from her and Tracey.",
      "Daphne had thought about that during lunch, with a sick feeling\nin her stomach unlike anything she'd felt before, and which had\ncaused her to stop eating halfway through her first plate.",
      "What I See has to come to pass... it probably makes being\neaten by Lethifolds look like a tea party...",
      "It wasn't any conscious decision that Daphne made, nothing like\nSlytherins were supposed to do, no weighing of the benefits to\nherself.",
      "Instead -",
      "Daphne told Hannah and Susan and everyone, that her informant\nhad warned her that the next bully was going to target Hufflepuffs\nin particular, and that the bully planned to risk the teachers'\nwrath in order to really hurt either Hannah or Susan, like\nseriously, and the two of them needed to stay out of this\none.",
      "Hannah had agreed to stay out of it.",
      "Susan had -",
      "\"What are you doing here?\u202f\" yelled General Granger,\nthough it was sort of a yell and a whisper at the same time.",
      "Susan's round face didn't change, like the Hufflepuff girl had\nsuddenly developed the sort of experienced blankness that Daphne's\nown Mother used. \"Am I here, really?\" Susan said calmly.",
      "\"You said you wouldn't come!\u202f\"",
      "\"Did I say that?\" said Susan. She flipped her wand casually in\none hand, leaning against the stone wall of the corridor where they\nwere waiting, her reddish-brown hair somehow arranging itself in\nperfect order against the yellow trim of her witch's robes. \"I\nwonder why. Maybe I didn't want Hannah to get any strange ideas.\nHufflepuff loyalty, you know.\"",
      "\"If you don't leave,\" said the Sunshine General, \"I'll call a\nmission abort, and we'll all go back to our study halls,\nMiss Bones!\"",
      "\"Hey!\u202f\" said Lavender. \"We didn't vote on -\"",
      "\"That's fine by me,\" said Susan, who was keeping a steady gaze\non the other end of the corridor where it merged into the tiled\nhallway where they'd been told to expect the bully. \"I'll just stay\nhere myself, then.\"",
      "\"Why -\" said Daphne. Her heart was in her throat. If I try\nto change it, if anyone tries to change it, really\nterrible, awful, no good, extremely bad things will happen. And\nthen it'll come to pass anyway... \"Why are you doing\nthis?\"",
      "\"It's not like me,\" said Susan. \"I know. But -\" Susan shrugged.\n\"People don't always behave like themselves, you know.\"",
      "They pleaded.",
      "They begged.",
      "Susan didn't even say anything anymore, she just kept watching,\nwaiting.",
      "Daphne was nearly crying, she kept wondering if she'd\ncaused this, if trying to change Fate was making this\nhappen worse -",
      "\"Daphne,\" said Hermione, her voice sounding much higher than\nusual, \"go get a teacher. Run.\"",
      "Daphne spun on her heels and started to pelt down the other\ndirection of the stony corridor, and then she realized, and she\nturned back to where all the other girls except Susan were watching\nher go, and Daphne, feeling like she was about to throw up, said,\n\"I can't...\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" said Hermione.",
      "\"I think it gets worse every time you try to fight it,\" said\nDaphne. That was how it worked in plays, sometimes.",
      "Hermione stared at her, and then Hermione said, \"Padma.\"",
      "The other Ravenclaw girl just tore right out of there without\narguing. Daphne watched her go, knowing that Padma wasn't as good a\nrunner as her, and now wondering if maybe that would turn out to be\nthe only reason why help would come too late...",
      "\"Bullies are here,\" Susan said laconically. \"Huh, they've got a\nhostage.\"",
      "They all whirled, and looked, and saw -",
      "Three older bullies, Daphne's eyes recognized Reese\nBelka who was a top lieutenant in one of the seventh-year armies,\nand Randolph Lee who was number two in the Hogwarts dueling club,\nand worst of all, Robert Jugson III, in his sixth year, whose\nfather was almost certainly a Death Eater.",
      "All three were surrounded by Shielding Charms, blue hazes that\nglowed beneath the surface in ribbons of other color and showed\noccasional faceting above, multi-layered shields like the three of\nthem thought they were fighting serious duelists and had expended\nenergy accordingly.",
      "And behind them, bound and supported by glowing ropes, was\nHannah Abbott. Her eyes were wide and panicked and her mouth was\nmoving, though they couldn't hear anything through the\nQuietus they'd put up earlier.",
      "Then Jugson made an offhand gesture with his wand, and the\nglowing ropes flung Hannah at them, there was a small pop as\nHannah's body blew through the Quieting barrier, Susan's wand was\ninstantly pointing at Hannah and Susan's voice muttered\n\"Wingardium Leviosa\" -",
      "\"Run!\u202f\" screamed Hannah, as she was gently lowered to\nthe ground.",
      "But the corridor behind them and in front of them was now\nblocked with a glowing gray field, a barrier spell that Daphne\ndidn't recognize.",
      "\"Do I need to explain what this is about?\" Lee said with false\njoviality. The seventh-year duelist was sporting a smile that\ndidn't reach his eyes. \"Well, just in case, you little\ninconveniences, and that includes you Miss Greengrass, you've been\nquite enough trouble and you've told quite enough lies. We brought\nyour little friend just to make sure everyone knew we got all of\nyou - though I suppose the other Ravenclaw girl is hiding around a\ncorner or clinging to the ceiling somewhere? Well, no matter. This\nis your -\"",
      "\"Enough talk,\" said Robert Jugson III, \"time for pain,\" and\nraised his wand. \"Cluthe!\u202f\"",
      "Simultaneously Susan pointed her wand and said\n\"Prismatis!\u202f\" and a small rainbow sphere formed in midair\nalmost instantly, the miniature barrier so condensed and bright\nthat it stayed intact even as Jugson's hex hit it and bounced off\ntoward Belka, whose wand flashed to swat away the dark bolt; and\nthen a moment later the many-colored blaze was gone.",
      "Daphne's eyes went wide for a moment; she'd never thought of\nusing a Prismatic Sphere like that -",
      "\"Jugsy, honey?\" said Belka. Her lips widened in a vicious smile.\n\"I thought we discussed this. First we beat them, then we\nplay.\"",
      "\"P-please,\" said Hermione Granger in a faltering voice, \"let\nthem go - I, I, I promise I'll -\"",
      "\"Oh, really,\" said Lee in an annoyed tone. \"Are you about to\noffer to turn yourself over if we let the others go? We've got\nall of you, now.\"",
      "Jugson smiled, then. \"It could be funny,\" said the sixth-year\njunior Death Eater, softly and with menace. \"How about if you lick\nmy shoes, mudblood, and one of your friends can go? Pick\nwhichever one you like best, leave the others to get hurt.\"",
      "\"Nope,\" said the young voice of Susan Bones, \"not going to\nhappen,\" and with a blindingly fast motion the Hufflepuff girl\nleapt leftward just as a red stunbolt erupted from Belka's wand,\nDaphne could hardly see the movement as Susan seemed to\nhit the corridor wall and then bounce off it like she was a rubber\nball and her legs smashed into Jugson's face, it didn't go\nthrough the shield but the sixth-year went sprawling backward with\nthe impact and Susan followed him downward and her foot stamped\ndown on the boy's wand arm, again being repelled by the shield,\n\"Elmekia!\u202f\" shouted Lee and Parvati shouted\n\"Prismatis!\u202f\" and the rainbow wall formed but the fiery\nblue blast passed right through it like it wasn't even there, the\nbolt missed Susan by inches, there was a whirlwind of motion that\nDaphne couldn't follow during which Belka had her feet knocked out\nfrom under her, but the older witch just rolled back to a stand and\nthen -",
      "Daphne saw it coming, and her lips started to mouth\n\"Pris-\" but it was already too late.",
      "Three blasts of brilliance slammed into Susan at once, she had\nher wand raised as though she could counter them and there was a\nwhite flash as the hexes struck the magical wood, but then Susan's\nlegs convulsed and sent her flying into a corridor wall. Her head\nhit with a strange cracking sound, and then Susan fell down and lay\nmotionless with her head at an odd-seeming angle, her wand still\nclutched in one outstretched hand.",
      "There was a moment of frozen silence.",
      "Parvati scrambled over to where Susan lay, pressed a thumb over\nthe pulse point on Susan's wrist, and then - then slowly,\ntremblingly, Parvati rose to her feet, her eyes huge -",
      "\"Vitalis revelio,\" said Lee just as Parvati opened her\nmouth, and Susan's body was surrounded by a warm red glow. Now the\nseventh-year boy really was grinning. \"Probably just a broken\ncollarbone, I'd say. Nice try, though.\"",
      "\"Merlin, they are tricky,\" said Jugson.",
      "\"You had me going for a second there, dearies.\" The seventh-year\ngirl wasn't smiling at all.",
      "\"Tonare!\u202f\" screamed Daphne, raising her wand above her\nhead and focusing harder than she ever had in her life. \"Rava\ncalvaria! Lucis -\"",
      "She didn't even see the hex that got her.",
      "Hermione felt the jolt of Innervation bringing her awake, and\nout of some intuitive strategism she didn't roll to her\nfeet right away; it had been a completely hopeless battle and she\ndidn't know what she could do but some instinct told her that\nleaping to her feet wasn't it.",
      "Just a crack, Hermione opened her eyes, and the thin rays of\nlight that entered them showed Parvati backing away from all three\nbullies, the last girl standing that Hermione could see.",
      "And her eyes also showed Tracey fallen not far away from her,\nand Hermione's wand was still in her hand; and so, desperately\nhoping the Slytherin girl would show more sense than she usually\ndid, Hermione made the wand movements as subtly as she could, and\nhardly moving her lips, whispered, \"Innervate.\"",
      "Hermione felt the spell working, but Tracey didn't move.\nHermione hoped it was because Tracey was being cunning, and waiting\nto...",
      "What could they do?",
      "Hermione didn't know, and the panic that had waited through the\nmoments of fighting was starting to eat her up inside now that she\nwas still, now that she was trying to think, now that she could see\nthat it was all absolutely hopeless.",
      "That was when Hermione heard a thud, and though it was out of\nher field of vision now, she knew that Parvati had fallen.",
      "A moment of silence came, and passed.",
      "\"Now what?\" said the voice of the scary-soft boy.",
      "\"Now we wake up the mudblood,\" said the precise voice of the\nscary-formal boy, \"and find out who's really behind them,\nnot Salazar Slytherin's ghost.\"",
      "\"No, dears,\" said the voice of the scary-sweet girl,\n\"first we bind them all very securely -\"",
      "And then there was a sound like lightning and thunder and\nHermione's eyes widened in shock before she could stop herself, and\nin her widened field of vision she saw the scary-soft boy\nconvulsing as yellow arcs of energy crawled over him like giant\nblazing worms. His wand flew out of his hand as he collapsed to the\nground, twitching, and then a moment later he lay still.",
      "\"Is everyone else asleep now?\" said a voice. \"Good.\"",
      "Susan Bones rose from the floor near where the scary-soft boy\nhad stood, neck still oddly bent. Then she rolled her head around\nher shoulders, a casual loose motion, and her head was straight\nagain.",
      "The round-faced first-year girl stood facing the remaining two\nbullies with one hand cocked on her hip.",
      "Grinning.",
      "And surrounded by faceted blue haze.",
      "\"Polyjuice!\" spat the bully-girl.",
      "\"Polyfluis Reverso!\u202f\" roared the remaining boy\nbully.",
      "Something like the form of a mirrored scarf spat out of his wand\n-",
      "Passed without resistance through the haze surrounding Susan\n-",
      "For an instant, she glowed in a strange mirror-color, like a\nreflection of herself -",
      "And then the glow faded.",
      "The young girl still stood there, hand on her hip.",
      "\"Wrong,\" said Susan.",
      "\"And this is the truth,\" said Susan. \"In case nobody\never told you -\"",
      "In her small hand a wand rose up, blurred by the blue haze\nsurrounding it.",
      "\"You don't mess with the 'Puffs,\" said Susan, and with a grey\nflash so bright it hurt Hermione's half-closed eyes, the real\nbattle started.",
      "It went on for a while.",
      "Some of the ceiling got melted.",
      "The girl-bully tried to cry a truce, that they would leave and\ntake Jugson with them, and Susan roared out the syllables of a\ncurse Hermione recognized as Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting which was\nillegal in seven countries.",
      "Eventually the girl-bully lay unconscious and unawakenable on\nthe ground, and the last boy-bully had fled leaving his companions'\nbodies behind, and Susan was leaned over against one wall, covered\nin sweat and her scorched robes soaked through with wet spots,\ngasping for breath, and clutching at her right shoulder using her\nleft hand.",
      "After a while Susan straightened up, and turned to look back at\nwhere her fellow witches were sleeping on the floor.",
      "Well, they should've been sleeping on the floor.",
      "Lavender was already sitting up with eyes as wide as\nwatermelons.",
      "\"That...\" said Lavender.",
      "\"Was...\" said Tracey.",
      "\"What?\u202f\" said Hermione.",
      "\"I mean, what?\u202f\" said Parvati.",
      "\"Cool!\u202f\" said Lavender.",
      "\"Oh, hell,\" said Susan Bones. Her face had already looked a\nlittle pale beneath the sweat, and now it was getting paler,\nlooking almost frighteningly white. \"Ah... could I convince you\nthat you hallucinated all that?\"",
      "There was a rapid exchange of glances. Hermione looked at\nParvati, Parvati looked at Lavender, Lavender briefly locked gazes\nwith Tracey.",
      "The four of them looked back at Susan and shook their heads.",
      "\"Oh, hell,\" said Susan again. \"Look I'll be back in a few\nminutes but I've really got to go now please don't say\nanything bye!\"",
      "And Susan ran out into the hallway, moving surprisingly fast,\nbefore anyone could say another word.",
      "\"No, seriously, what?\u202f\" said Parvati.",
      "\"Innervate,\" said Hermione, pointing her wand at\nDaphne, whose body she hadn't been able to see before; and Lavender\npointed her wand at Hannah's body and said the same.",
      "Hannah's eyes opened and she tried frantically to roll to her\nfeet, but collapsed to the ground halfway through.",
      "\"It's okay, Hannah!\" said Lavender. \"We won.\"",
      "\"We what?\u202f\" said Hannah from her little heap on the\nfloor.",
      "Daphne hadn't stirred, but Hermione could see her chest rising\nand falling, and the breathing rhythm looked normal enough. \"I\nthink she's okay,\" said Hermione, \"but -\" She took a moment to\nswallow, her mouth was still dry. This had all gotten way, way,\nway out of hand. \"I think we ought to take Daphne to Madam\nPomfrey's...\"",
      "\"Sure, sure, just give me a second here and I'll\nprobably be fine,\" said Parvati.",
      "\"Excuse me,\" Hannah said in a tone that was polite, but\nfirm. \"How did we win? And why does the ceiling look all\nmelty?\"",
      "There was a pause.",
      "\"Susan did it,\" said Tracey.",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Parvati, voice only slightly shaky as she stood up\nand started to brush off her red-trimmed robes, \"it turns out that\nSusan Bones is the Heir of Hufflepuff and she's opened up the\nlong-lost entrance to Helga Hufflepuff's Chamber of Hard Work and\nPractice.\"",
      "\"Huh?\u202f\" said Hannah, who was feeling over herself as if\nto make sure all her body parts were still there. \"I thought that\nwas just something Professor Sprout says to teach us an Important\nMoral Lesson - Susan is?\"",
      "Slowly, Hermione was beginning to feel a bit more together. It\nhadn't really been more than thirty seconds of extreme terror, at\nleast not the parts she'd been conscious for. \"Actually,\" Hermione\nsaid carefully, as her mind started to work again, \"I'm pretty sure\nthat is just something Professor Sprout says, it wasn't in\nHogwarts: A History or anywhere else I've read -\"",
      "\"She's a double witch!\u202f\" shouted Tracey, her voice so\nhigh it cracked. \"She is! She's one of them!\nShe's been this whole time!\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" yelled Parvati, twisting around to look at\nTracey. \"That is the looniest thing -\"",
      "\"Of course!\u202f\" said Lavender, now all the way on her\nfeet and starting to bounce up and down with excitement. \"I\nshould've realized!\u202f\"",
      "\"Susan's a what?\u202f\" said Hermione.",
      "\"A double witch!\" said Tracey.",
      "\"You see,\" said Lavender, speaking very rapidly, \"There've\nalways been stories, about these children who are born as super\nmagicians who can cast spells no one else can, and there's a whole\nsecret school hidden inside Hogwarts with classes that only they\ncan see and go to -\"",
      "\"Those are just stories!\u202f\" yelled Parvati. \"That's not\nhow real life works! I mean, sure, I read those books too -\"",
      "\"Just a minute, please,\" said Hermione. Maybe her mind\nwas feeling a little slow after all. \"You mean even though\nyou already get to go to a magical school and everything,\nyou still want to go to a double magical school?\"",
      "Lavender looked at her, puzzled. \"What?\" said Lavender. \"Who\nwouldn't want to have super extra magical powers? It would\nbe like this whole amazing destiny and everything! It'd\nmean you were special!\u202f\"",
      "Hannah nodded to that, looking up from where she'd crawled to\nDaphne's side and was checking the girl for broken bones. \"I wish\nI was a double witch,\" Hannah said, and then, sounding a\nlittle sadder, \"though I don't believe there is any such thing,\nreally... what did you see Susan do, exactly? I mean, are you sure\nyou weren't just seeing things after getting stunned?\"",
      "Hermione truly, truly couldn't find any words at this point.",
      "\"Oh, no,\" said Tracey. The Slytherin girl spun around to look at\nthe entrance to the corridor, her robes fluttering around her. \"Oh\nno! We've got to get out of here! We've got to get away before\nSusan comes back with someone who can Super-Memory-Charm us!\"",
      "\"Susan wouldn't do that!\" said Parvati. \"I mean, if\nthere even was -\"",
      "\"WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?\" roared a high-pitched squeaky voice, as\nProfessor Flitwick stormed into the partially melted corridor like\na small, dangerously compressed package of pure academic fury, an\nashen-faced Padma gasping along behind him.",
      "\"What happened?\u202f\" Susan blurted to the girl who looked\nexactly like her, except for the scorched robes damp with\nsweat.",
      "\"Ooh, great question!\" said the other Susan Bones as she rapidly\nskinned off what was left of her borrowed clothes. A moment later\nthe girl began to Metamorphose back into her more accustomed form\nof Nymphadora Tonks. \"Sorry but I couldn't think of anything myself\nso you've got about three minutes to decide on an answer to that\n-\"",
      "As Daphne Greengrass observed afterward with some acidity, the\nflaw in Hermione's cunning plan to make sure that House points were\ntaken evenly from all four Houses if they got caught, was that it\ndidn't work on detentions.",
      "They'd all agreed to keep their mouths shut about Susan's\nmysterious powers - even Tracey, after Susan threatened to have her\nSuper-Memory-Charmed if she didn't promise. Unfortunately, they\ndiscovered at dinnertime that someone had forgotten to tell the\nbullies about their agreement, and also that Susan Bones\nhad sacrificed her soul to dreadful forbidden powers which now\ninhabited the hulk of her body and that was why they'd all gotten\ndetention.",
      "\"Hermione?\" Harry Potter said to her from beside her at the\ndinner table, his voice very tentative. \"Please don't take offense,\nand I'll understand if you say it's none of my business, but I\nthink all this is starting to spin out of control.\"",
      "Hermione went on mashing the slice of chocolate cake on her\nplate into a seamless mush of cake and icing. \"Yes,\" Hermione said,\nher voice might have been a little acerbic, \"that was what I said\nto Professor Flitwick while I was apologizing to him, that I knew\nthings had gotten out of hand, and he yelled: Really, Miss\nGranger? Do you think? in a squeak so loud that my ears caught\non fire. I mean my ears actually caught on fire. Professor\nFlitwick had to put them out again.\"",
      "Harry had put his hand to his forehead. \"Excuse me,\" Harry said.\nHis face was perfectly straight. \"Sometimes I still have a little\ntrouble getting used to that sort of thing. Hey, Hermione, remember\nwhen we were young and naive and we still thought the world was a\nrelatively understandable place?\"",
      "Hermione put her fork down and looked at him for a moment. \"Do\nyou sometimes wish you were a Muggle, Harry?\"",
      "\"Huh?\u202f\" said Harry. \"Well, of course not! I mean, even\nif I was a Muggle, I'd probably have tried someday to take over the\nworrrrlllll-\" as Hermione gave him a look and the boy\nhastily swallowed the word and said, \"I mean optimize of\ncourse, you know that's what I really mean, Hermione! My\npoint is, it's not like my goals would change one way or\nanother. But with magic it's going to be a lot easier to get things\ndone than if I had to do stuff using only the Muggle capability\nset. If you think about it logically, that's why I'm going\nto Hogwarts instead of just ignoring all this and studying for a\ncareer in nanotechnology.\"",
      "Hermione, having finished hand-crafting her Chocolate Cake\nSauce, began to dip her carrots in it and eat them.",
      "\"Why do you ask?\" said Harry. \"Do you wish you were\nback in the Muggle world?\"",
      "\"Not exactly,\" Hermione said, as she crunched into both the\ncarrot and the chocolate. \"I was just, well, feeling strange about\nhaving wanted to be a witch... Did you want to be a wizard\nwhen you were little?\"",
      "\"Of course,\" Harry said promptly. \"I also wanted psychic powers\nand super-strength and adamantium-reinforced bones and my own\nflying castle and sometimes I felt sad that I might have to settle\nfor just being a famous scientist and an astronaut.\"",
      "Hermione nodded. \"You know,\" she said softly, \"I think the\nwitches and wizards who grow up here don't really\nappreciate magic properly...\"",
      "\"Well, of course they don't,\" Harry said, \"that's what gives us\nour advantage. Isn't that obvious? I mean seriously, that was\nbloody obvious to me within five minutes of walking into Diagon\nAlley.\" There was a puzzled look on the boy's face, like he\ncouldn't understand why she was paying attention to something so\nordinary."

      "From behind the closed door of the office came a whisper,\ncarrying through the door as though no door were present.",
      "\"It is not my office hours,\" said that cold whisper, \"nor yet\nthe time of our meeting. I take ten Quirrell points from you, and\nbe glad it is not more.\"",
      "Harry stayed calm. Going through Azkaban had recalibrated his\nscale of emotional disturbances; and losing a House point, which\nhad formerly rated five out of ten, now lay somewhere around zero\npoint three. Harry's voice was likewise level, as he said, \"You\nmade a testable prediction and it was falsified, Professor. I only\nwished to note that.\"",
      "As Harry turned to go, he heard the door opening behind him, and\nhe swung back around in some surprise.",
      "Professor Quirrell was leaning back in his chair, his head\nlolling back against its rest, as a parchment floated before him.\nBoth the Defense Professor's hands rested limply on the desk, as\nthough nerveless. He might have been a corpse, excepting that the\nice-blue eyes still moved, back and forth, back and forth.",
      "The parchment vanished, and was replaced by another so quickly\nit was like the material had only flickered.",
      "Then the lips moved as well. \"And from this,\" whispered the\nlips, \"you infer what, Mr. Potter?\"",
      "Harry was shaken by the sight, but his voice stayed even as he\nsaid, \"That ordinary people do not always do nothing, and that\nHermione Granger is in more danger from Slytherin House than you\nthought.\"",
      "The lips curved, ever so barely. \"So you think I have failed in\nmy grasp of human nature. But that is hardly the only possibility,\nboy. Do you see the other?\"",
      "Harry furrowed his brows as he stared at the Defense\nProfessor.",
      "\"I tire of this,\" the Defense Professor whispered. \"You will\nstand there until you see it for yourself, or else leave.\" As\nthough Harry had stopped existing, the Defense Professor's eyes\nlooked back to the parchment, once more scanning back and\nforth.",
      "It was six parchments later that Harry saw it, and said out\nloud, \"You think your prediction failed because there was some\nother factor at work which was not in your model. Some reason why\nSlytherin House hates Hermione more than you realized. Like when\nthe orbital calculations for Uranus were wrong, and the problem\nwasn't in Newton's Laws, it was that they didn't know about Neptune\n-\"",
      "The parchment vanished, and was not replaced. The head rose from\nits lolling position then, facing Harry more directly, and the\nvoice which issued forth was quiet, but not toneless. \"I think,\nboy,\" Professor Quirrell said softly, but in something approaching\nhis normal voice, \"that if all Slytherin House hated her so much, I\nwould have seen it. And yet three formidable fighters of that House\ndid something rather than nothing, at risk and at cost to\nthemselves. What force could have moved them, or willed their\nmotion?\" The icy blue glitter of the Defense Professor's eyes met\nHarry's own gaze. \"Some hand possessed of influence within\nSlytherin, perhaps. Then how would that hand have benefited itself\nby harm done to the girl and her followers?\"",
      "\"Um...\" said Harry. \"It would have to be someone threatened by\nHermione somehow, or someone who would get the credit if she was\nhurt? I don't know anyone who fits that profile, but then I don't\nknow much about anyone in Slytherin outside first-year.\" The\nthought was also coming to Harry that deducing a hidden mastermind\nfrom a single mildly-unexpected attack seemed like insufficient\nevidence to support the prior improbability of the theory; but then\nit was Professor Quirrell who was doing the\ndeducing...",
      "The Defense Professor was just looking at Harry, eyelids\nslightly lowered as though in impatience.",
      "\"And yes,\" said Harry, \"I am sure that Draco Malfoy\nisn't behind it.\"",
      "A hiss of outward air like a sigh. \"He is the son of Lucius\nMalfoy, trained to the most exacting standards. Whatever you have\nseen of him, even in what seem to be unguarded moments when his\nmask slips and you trust that you have seen the truth beneath, even\nthat may all be part of the face he chooses to show you.\"",
      "Only if Draco successfully cast the Patronus Charm as part\nof keeping up the act. But Harry didn't say that, of course;\ninstead he just grinned slightly, and said, \"So either you've\nreally never read Draco's mind, or that's just what you\nwant me to think.\"",
      "There was a pause. One of the hands turned over, beckoned a\nfinger.",
      "Harry stepped into the room. The door closed behind him.",
      "\"That was not something you should have said aloud in human\nspeech,\" said Professor Quirrell's soft voice. \"Legilimency, on\nMalfoy's heir? Did Lucius Malfoy learn of it, he would have me\nassassinated outright.\"",
      "\"He would try,\" Harry said. It should have won a\ncrinkle of Professor Quirrell's eyes, but the Defense Professor's\nface was unmoving. \"But sorry.\"",
      "When the Defense Professor spoke again, his voice had once more\nbecome a cold whisper. \"I suppose I could, and pity the assassin.\"\nHis head fell back against the chair, lolled to one side, the eyes\nno longer meeting Harry's. \"But these small games hardly hold my\ninterest as they stand. Add Legilimency, and it ceases to be a game\nat all.\"",
      "Harry hardly knew what to say. He'd seen Professor Quirrell in\nan angry mood once or twice before, but this seemed emptier, and\nHarry didn't know what to say to it. What's bothering you,\nProfessor Quirrell? he could not ask.",
      "\"What does hold your interest?\" Harry said a few\nmoments later, after he'd worked it out as a safer-seeming strategy\nfor redirecting Professor Quirrell's attention to positive things.\nCiting experimental results about keeping a gratitude journal as a\nstrategy for improving life happiness didn't seem like it would be\ntaken well.",
      "\"I will tell you what does not hold my interest,\" said that icy\nwhisper. \"Grading Ministry-mandated essays does not hold my\ninterest, Mr. Potter. But I have undertaken the position of Defense\nProfessor at Hogwarts, and I will see it through to its end.\"\nAnother parchment appeared in front of Professor Quirrell's head,\nand his eyes began to scan it. \"Reese Belka held a high position in\nmy armies before her folly. I will offer her the chance to stay\nrather than being expelled, if she tells me exactly of the forces\nwhich moved her. And I shall make clear to her what will happen if\nshe lies. I do permit myself to read faces.\"",
      "The Defense Professor's finger pointed past Harry, toward the\ndoor.",
      "\"But whether you were wrong about human nature,\" Harry said, \"or\nwhether there's some extra force at work in Slytherin House -\neither way, Hermione Granger is in more danger than you predicted.\nLast time it was three strong fighters, so what happens after\n-\"",
      "\"She wishes not my help, nor yours,\" said a soft cold voice. \"I\nno longer find your concerns so entertaining as I once did, Mr.\nPotter. Go.\"",
      "Somehow, even though they were all equals and she definitely\nwasn't in charge, it was always Hermione who ended up speaking\nfirst in this sort of situation.",
      "The four tables of Hogwarts, the four Houses having breakfast,\nwere glancing over at where they, the eight members of S.P.H.E.W.,\nhad gathered off to one side.",
      "Professor Flitwick was also staring sternly at all of them from\nthe Head Table. Hermione wasn't looking there, but she could feel\nProfessor Flitwick's gaze on the back of her neck.\nLiterally feel it. It was really creepy.",
      "\"Why'd you tell Tracey you wanted to talk to us, Mr. Potter?\"\nsaid Hermione, her tone crisp.",
      "\"Professor Quirrell expelled Reese Belka from her army last\nnight,\" Harry Potter said. \"And from all her other after-school\nDefense activities. Do any of you see the significance of that?\nMiss Greengrass? Padma?\"",
      "Harry's eyes swept over them, as Hermione exchanged a puzzled\nglance with Padma, and Daphne shook her head.",
      "\"Well,\" Harry said quietly, \"I wouldn't actually expect you to.\nBut what it means is that you're in danger, and I don't know how\nmuch danger.\" The boy squared his shoulders, looking straight into\nHermione's eyes. \"I wasn't going to say this, but... I just wanted\nto offer to put you under whatever protection I could give. Make it\nclear to everyone that anyone who messes with you, is messing with\nthe Boy-Who-Lived.\"",
      "\"Harry!\" said Hermione sharply. \"You know I don't want\n-\"",
      "\"Some of them are my friends too, Hermione.\" Harry\ndidn't take his eyes from hers. \"And it's their decision, not\nyours. Padma? You told me that I owed you no debt for what I did,\nand that's the sort of thing a friend would say.\"",
      "Hermione broke her gaze from Harry, to look at where Padma was\nshaking her head.",
      "\"Lavender?\" Harry said. \"You fought well in my army, and I'll\nfight for you if you wish it.\"",
      "\"Thank you, General!\" Lavender said crisply. \"I mean\nMr. Potter. No, though. I'm a heroine and a Gryffindor, and I can\nfight for myself.\"",
      "There was a pause.",
      "\"Parvati?\" Harry said. \"Susan? Hannah? Daphne? I don't know any\nof you so well, but it's something I would offer anyone who came to\nask it of me, I think.\"",
      "One by one, the other four girls shook their heads.",
      "Hermione realized what was coming, then, but she didn't see a\nsingle thing she could do about it.",
      "\"And my loyal soldier, Chaotic Tracey?\" said Harry Potter.",
      "\"Really?\u202f\" gasped Tracey, oblivious to the stabbing\nglares that Hermione and every other girl were directing at her.\nTracey's hands flew artfully to her cheeks, though she didn't\nactually manage to blush, not that Hermione could see; and her\nbrown eyes were, if not shining, at least opened very wide. \"You'd\ndo that? For me? I mean - I mean, of course, absolutely,\nGeneral Chaos -\"",
      "And so it was on that very morning that Harry Potter went over\nto the Gryffindor table, and then the Slytherin table, and told\nboth Houses that anyone who hurt Tracey Davis, regardless of what\nshe was doing at the time, would, quote, learn the true meaning of\nChaos, unquote.",
      "It was with considerable restraint that Draco Malfoy managed to\nprevent himself from slamming his head repeatedly into his plate of\ntoast.",
      "They weren't exactly scientists, the bullies of Hogwarts.",
      "But even they, Draco knew, were going to want to test\nit.",
      "The Society for the Promotion of Heroic Equality for Witches\nhadn't announced it, it didn't seem like it would do any\ngood to announce it. But they had all quietly decided (or,\nin the case of Lavender, been shouted into it by all seven other\ngirls) to take a break from fighting bullies for a while, at least\nuntil their Heads of House weren't looking at them quite so sharply\nanymore, and older students had stopped bumping Hermione into\nwalls.",
      "Daphne had told Millicent that they were taking a\nbreak.",
      "And so it was with some puzzlement, a few days later, that\nDaphne looked at the parchment delivered to her at lunch, drawn in\na hand so shaky it was almost unreadable, saying:",
      "2 this afternoon at the top of the stairs going up from the\nlibrary REALLY IMPORTANT everyone has to be there -\nMillicent",
      "Daphne looked around, but she couldn't see Millicent anywhere in\nthe Great Hall.",
      "\"A message from your informant?\" said Hermione, when Daphne told\nher. \"That's odd - I didn't -\"",
      "\"You didn't what?\" said Daphne, after the Ravenclaw girl had\nstopped in mid-sentence.",
      "The Sunshine General shook her head and said, \"Listen, Daphne, I\nthink we need to know where these messages come from before we keep\nfollowing them. Look at what happened last time, how could anyone\nhave known where those three bullies would be, unless they\nwere in on it?\"",
      "\"I can't say -\" Daphne said. \"I mean, I can't say anything, but\nI know where the messages come from, and I know how anyone can\nknow.\"",
      "Hermione gave Daphne a look that, for a moment, made\nthe Ravenclaw girl look scarily like Professor McGonagall.",
      "\"Uh huh,\" said Hermione. \"And do you know how Susan suddenly\nturned into Supergirl?\"",
      "Daphne shook her head, and said, \"No, but I think it might be\nreally important that if we get a message saying we should\nbe somewhere, everyone has to be there.\" Daphne hadn't\nseen what had happened with Susan, after Daphne had tried\nto avert the prophecy by keeping Susan away. But she'd been\ntold about it afterward, and now Daphne was afraid\nthat...",
      "She might have possibly...",
      "Might possibly have Broken Something...",
      "\"Uh huh,\" said Hermione, who was doing the McGonagall Stare\nagain.",
      "Nobody seemed to know where it had started, who had started it.\nIf you'd tried tracing it afterward, tracked it back word by word\nand mutter by mutter, you probably would have found it all going in\na huge circle.",
      "Peregrine Derrick was tapped on his shoulder as he left Potions\nthat morning.",
      "Jaime Astorga heard a whisper in his ear at lunch.",
      "Robert Jugson III discovered a tiny folded note under his\nplate.",
      "Carl Sloper overheard two older Gryffindors whispering about it,\nand they gave him significant glances as they walked past.",
      "Nobody seemed to know where the word began, or who had first\nspoken it, but it named the place, and it named the time, and it\nsaid that the color would be white.",
      "\"Every single one of you had better be absolutely clear on\nthis,\" said Susan Bones. The Hufflepuff girl, or whatever strange\npower had possessed her, wasn't even pretending to act\nnormal anymore. The round-faced girl was striding through the halls\nwith a firm, confident gait. \"If we get there and it's just one\nbully, that's fine, you can fight them the regular way. My\nmysterious superpowers won't activate if there are no innocents in\ndanger. But if five seventh-year bullies jump out of a closet, you\nknow what you do? That's right, you run away and let me\nfight them. Finding a teacher is optional, the important thing is\nthat you run away as soon as I create an opening. In a\nfight like that you are liabilities. You are civilian\ntargets I have to worry about protecting. So you will get away\nas fast as possible and you will not try to do\nanything heroic or so help me, the hour you get out of\nyour healer's beds I will personally show up and kick\nyour asses right back in. Are we all clear on that?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" squeaked most of the girls, though in Hannah's case it\ncame out, \"Yes, Lady Susan!\"",
      "\"Don't call me that,\" snapped Susan. \"And I don't\nthink I heard you, Miss Brown! I'm warning you, I have friends\nwho write plays and if you do anything dumb, posterity will\nremember you as Lavender, the Amazing Stupid Hostage.\"",
      "(Hermione was beginning to worry about just how many other\nHogwarts students besides Harry had mysterious dark sides, and\nwhether she was likely to develop one if she kept hanging\nout with them.)",
      "\"Alright, Captain Bones,\" said Lavender in an unusually\nrespectful tone, as they turned another corner along the shortest\nway to the library, passing through a rather large corridor studded\nwith six sets of double doors, three sets on either side. \"Can I\nask if there's any way for me to become a double\nwitch?\"",
      "\"Sign up for the Auror preparation program in your sixth year,\"\nsaid Susan. \"It's the next best thing. Oh, and if a famous Auror\noffers to oversee your summer internship, just ignore anyone who\nwarns you that he's a terrible influence or that you're almost\ncertainly going to die.\"",
      "Lavender was nodding rapidly. \"Got it, got it.\"",
      "(Padma, who hadn't actually been there last time, was giving\nSusan very skeptical looks.)",
      "Then Susan suddenly stopped in place and her wand snapped up and\nshe said, \"Protego Maximus!\u202f\"",
      "A jolt of adrenaline went through Hermione, she was instantly\ndrawing her wand and spinning around -",
      "But she couldn't see anything wrong, through the greater blue\nhaze now surrounding them all.",
      "The other girls, who had likewise pulled into formation, were\nalso looking puzzled.",
      "\"Sorry!\" said Susan. \"Sorry, girls. Give me a moment to check\nthis place out. Thinking of a certain person has just reminded me\nthat this hall we're in right now, with all those doors, would be\nan excellent place for an ambush.\"",
      "There was a moment of silence.",
      "\"Now,\" said a harsh male voice, blurred into unidentifiability\nby a buzzing undertone.",
      "All six sets of double doors slammed open.",
      "White robes filed silently forward, all-concealing white robes\nwithout marks of House affiliation and white cloth hiding the faces\nbeneath the hoods. They marched out, and marched out, crowding the\ngreat corridor in numbers too high to count easily. Less than fifty\nrobes, probably. Certainly more than thirty. All of them already\nsurrounded by blue haze.",
      "Susan said some Extremely Bad Words, so awful that at almost any\nother time, Hermione would have noticed.",
      "\"That message!\" Daphne cried in sudden horror. \"It\nwasn't from -\"",
      "\"Millicent Bulstrode?\" said the voice and its buzzing undertone.\n\"No, it wasn't. You see, Miss Greengrass, if the same girl sends\noff a Slytherin message every day you fight a bully, pretty soon\nsomeone else will notice. We'll have a talk with her after we're\ndone with you.\"",
      "\"Miss Susan,\" said Hannah in a voice just starting to quaver,\n\"can you be super enough to -\"",
      "Wands rose in many hands. There came a series of blinding\nflashes of green light, a massive volley of shieldbreakers, at the\nend of which there was no more protective blue dome surrounding\nthem, and Susan had fallen to her knees, clutching her head.",
      "Barriers of solid blackness had sprung into being at both ends\nof the corridor. Behind the double doors that Hermione could see\ninto, there were only unused classrooms, very dead ends.",
      "\"No,\" said the male voice with that buzz overlaid, \"she can't.\nIn case you haven't noticed, you've gotten quite a lot of people\nvery angry at you and we have no intention of losing this time. All\nright everyone, prepare to fire.\"",
      "The wands around the perimeter aimed again, low enough that\ntheir enemies wouldn't hit each other if they missed.",
      "And then another male voice, with a similar buzz accompanying\nit, suddenly said \"Homenum Revelio!\u202f\"",
      "An instant later there was another massive volley of\nshieldbreakers and hexes, fired on reflex at the suddenly revealed\nfigure, shattering the shields which had almost immediately begun\nto form around it -",
      "And then, as that same figure fell to the ground, a stunned\nsilence.",
      "\"Professor Snape?\u202f\" said the second voice.\n\"He's the one who's been interfering?\"",
      "It was the Potions Master of Hogwarts who now lay unconscious on\nthe stone floor, the dirt-spotted robes stirring for a final moment\nbefore they settled in place, his fallen hand outstretched toward\nwhere his wand was slowly rolling away.",
      "\"No,\" said the first male voice, now sounding a bit more\nuncertain. Then it rallied, \"No, that can't possibly be it. He\nheard us passing the word, of course, and came along to make sure\nnobody screwed it up again. We'll wake him up afterward and\napologize and he'll Memory-Charm the children so they don't\nremember, he's a Professor so he can do that. Anyway, we should\nmake sure we're really alone now. Veritas\nOculum!\u202f\"",
      "Fully two dozen different Charms must have been spoken, then,\nbut no more invisible people showed up. One of them in particular\nmade Hermione's heart sink; she recognized it as the Charm which\nhad been listed alongside the description of the True Cloak of\nInvisibility, which would not reveal the Cloak, but would tell you\nwhether it or certain other artifacts were nearby.",
      "\"Girls?\" whispered Susan. She was slowly pushing herself to her\nfeet, though Hermione could see her limbs swaying and quivering.\n\"Girls, I'm sorry for what I said before. If you've got anything\nclever and heroic to try, you might as well try it.\"",
      "\"Oh, yeah,\" Tracey Davis said then, her voice trembling. \"I\nalmost forgot.\" The Slytherin girl raised her voice, and\nspoke.",
      "\"Hey, all of you!\" yelled Tracey in a high-pitched shaky shout.\n\"Hey, are you planning to hurt me too?\"",
      "\"Yes, actually,\" said the buzzing voice of the leader. \"We\nare.\"",
      "\"I'm under Harry Potter's protection, you know! Anyone who tries\nto hurt me will learn the true meaning of Chaos! So are you going\nto let me go?\" It should have sounded defiant. It came out sounding\nterrified.",
      "There was a pause. Some of the hoods of the robes turned to face\neach other, then turned back to face the girls.",
      "\"Hm...\" said the buzzing male voice. \"Hm... no.\"",
      "Tracey Davis put her wand away into her robes.",
      "Slowly, deliberately, she raised her right hand high in the air,\nand pressed her thumb and forefingers together.",
      "\"Go ahead,\" said that voice.",
      "Tracey Davis snapped her fingers.",
      "There was a long, awful pause.",
      "Nothing happened.",
      "\"Yes, well,\" said the voice -",
      "Tracey said, her voice sounding even higher and shakier,\n\"Acathla, mundatus sum.\" Her hand, stretching up still\nfurther, snapped its fingers a second time.",
      "A nameless chill went down Hermione's spine then, a frisson of\nfear and disorientation like she'd just felt the floor tilt beneath\nher, threatening to spill her into some darkness lying beneath.",
      "\"What's she -\" began a buzzing female voice.",
      "Tracey's face looked pale, twisted with fear, but her lips\nmoved, spilled forth sound in a high chant, \"Mabra, brahoring,\nmabra...\"",
      "A chill wind seemed to spring up within the confines of the\ncorridor, a dark breath that caressed their faces and touched their\nhands with ice.",
      "\"Fire at her on my count!\" shouted the leading voice. \"One,\ntwo, three!\u202f\" and maybe-forty voices roared spells,\ncreating a huge concentric array of fiery bolts that lit the wide\ncorridor brighter than the Sun -",
      "- for the short moment before the bolts struck and vanished upon\na dark red octagon that appeared in the air around the girls, and\nthen disappeared a moment later.",
      "Hermione saw it, she saw it but she still couldn't imagine it;\nshe couldn't imagine a Shielding Charm that powerful, a spell that\nwould withstand an army.",
      "And Tracey's voice went on chanting, her voice sounding louder\nand more confident, and her face screwed up like she was trying to\nremember something very exactly.",
      "\"Shuffle, duffle, muzzle, muff.\nFista, wista, mista-cuff.\"",
      "Now all those present could feel it, heroines and bullies alike,\nthe sensation of some dark will pressing down on them, a tingling\nin the air as something built and built and built. All the blue\nhazes around the white robes, all the shielding spells, had died\nout without any visible hex touching them. There were more flashes\nof light as more desperate spells were fired, but they fizzled out\nin midair like candle-flames touching water.",
      "The black barriers at the two ends of the corridor had\ndissipated like smoke beneath the growing pressure, but their\nevaporation revealed the exits sealed, blocked by tiled slats of\ndark metal that looked stained as though with blood; and as Tracey\nchanted \"Lemarchand, Lament, Lemarchand,\" a dreadful blue\nlight began to shine out from beneath the metal slats and between\nthem; and the six sets of double doors slammed shut all at once, as\npanicked white-robed bullies began to pound on them and howl.",
      "Then Tracey's hand slashed to her left, and she cried\n\"Khornath!\u202f\", then her hand pointed below her and\n\"Slaaneth!\u202f\", above her \"Nurgolth!\u202f\", and then,\nto her right, \"TZINTCHI!\u202f\"",
      "Tracey paused, took a deep breath; and Hermione found her voice\nand cried, \"Stop! Tracey, stop!\u202f\"",
      "But there was a strange wild smile on Tracey's face. She raised\nher hand still higher, and snapped her fingers a third time; and\nwhen she spoke again, beneath her high girlish voice there was an\nundertone as though some lower chorus were chanting along with\nher.",
      "\"Darkness beyond darkness, deeper than pitchest black.\nBuried beneath the flow of time...\nFrom darkness to darkness, your voice echoes in the\nemptiness,\nUnknown to death, nor known to life.\"",
      "\"What are you doing?\u202f\" shrieked Parvati, and the\nGryffindor girl stretched out a hand as though to pull down the\nSlytherin, who was now starting to float upward into the air; and\nboth Daphne and Susan grabbed Parvati's arm at the same time and\nDaphne cried out, \"Don't, we don't know what will happen if the\nritual is interrupted!\"",
      "\"Well what happens if it gets COMPLETED?\u202f\" screamed\nHermione, as close as she'd ever come to total brain meltdown.",
      "Susan's face was white as chalk, and she whispered, \"I'm sorry,\nMad-Eye...\"",
      "And Tracey spoke on, her body floating higher and higher off the\nfloor, her black hair whipping wildly around her in the chill\nwinds.",
      "\"You who know the gate, who are the gate, the key and\nguardian of the gate:\nI bid you open the way for him, and manifest his power before\nme!\"",
      "The corridor was plunged then into utter darkness and silence,\nso that only Tracey could be seen and heard, like there was nothing\nleft in the universe except her and the light illuminating her from\nsome nameless source.",
      "The shining girl raised her hand one final time, and with\ndreadful gravity, pressed her thumb and forefinger together.",
      "And within the darkness Hermione looked at Tracey's face and saw\nthat the Slytherin girl's eyes were now, to the exact shade, the\ngreen of Harry Potter's.",
      "\"Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres!\nHarry James Potter-Evans-Verres!\nHARRY JAMES POTTER-EVANS-VERRES!\"",
      "There was a snap like thunder, and then -",
      "Harry had chosen to assume a rather relaxed posture, as he sat\nin a low chair before the mighty desk of the Headmaster of\nHogwarts: one leg cocked over his knee, and his arms sprawling\ncasually to either side. Harry was doing his best to disregard the\nnoise from the surrounding devices, although the one directly\nbehind him that sounded like an owl hooting desperately as it was\nput through a woodchipper was pretty difficult to ignore.",
      "\"Harry,\" the old wizard said from behind the desk, the aged\nvoice level as the blue eyes stared out at him from beneath the\nshining half-moon spectacles. Headmaster Dumbledore had garbed\nhimself in robes of midnight purple; not true formal black, but\ndark enough to come close indeed to deadly seriousness, as the\nwizarding world counted the meaning of fashions. \"Were you...\nresponsible for this?\"",
      "\"I cannot deny that my influence was at work,\" Harry said.",
      "The old wizard took off his glasses, leaned forward to stare at\nHarry directly, blue eyes to green. \"I will ask you one question,\"\nthe Headmaster said in a quiet voice. \"Do you think that what you\ndid today was - appropriate?\u202f\"",
      "\"They were bullies and they came to that hallway with the direct\nintent of hurting Hermione Granger and seven other first-year\nchildren,\" Harry said levelly. \"If I am not too young for moral\njudgment, then neither are they. No, Headmaster, they didn't\ndeserve to die. But they did deserve to be stripped naked\nand glued to the ceiling.\"",
      "The old wizard put his glasses back on. For the first time that\nHarry had seen of him, the Headmaster seemed to be at a loss for\nwords. \"As Merlin himself is my witness,\" said Dumbledore, \"I\nhaven't the faintest notion of how I ought to react to this.\"",
      "\"That's pretty much the effect I was aiming for,\" said Harry. He\nfelt like he ought to be whistling a merry tune, but unfortunately\nhe had never learned how to whistle reliably.",
      "\"I need not ask you who is directly responsible,\" said\nthe Headmaster. \"Only three wizards within Hogwarts might be\npowerful enough. I myself did not do it. Severus has assured me he\nwas not involved. And the third...\" The Headmaster shook his head\nin some dismay. \"You loaned the Defense Professor your Cloak,\nHarry. I do not think that was wise. For now that he has escaped\ndetection by simple Charms, he surely knows that it is a Deathly\nHallow - if, indeed, he did not know from its first touch upon his\nflesh.\"",
      "\"Professor Quirrell had already deduced my possession of an\ninvisibility cloak,\" Harry said. \"And knowing him, he has probably\nguessed that it is a Deathly Hallow. But in this case,\nHeadmaster, it so happens that Professor Quirrell was under one of\nthose face-concealing white robes.\"",
      "There was another pause.",
      "\"How very cunning,\" said the Headmaster. He leaned back in his\nthrone and sighed. \"I have spoken to the Defense Professor. Just\nbefore you, indeed. I did not quite know what to say. I told him\nthat this was not the approved Hogwarts policy for dealing with\ninfractions of hallway discipline, and that I did not feel it was\nappropriate for a Hogwarts professor to do what he had done.\"",
      "\"And what did Professor Quirrell say to that?\" said Harry, who\nwas not impressed with Hogwarts's current policies for enforcing\nhallway discipline.",
      "The Headmaster wore a look of resignation. \"He said: Fire\nme.\"",
      "Somehow Harry managed not to cheer out loud.",
      "The Headmaster frowned. \"But why did he do it,\nHarry?\"",
      "\"Because Professor Quirrell doesn't like school bullies and I\nasked very politely,\" said Harry. And he was feeling bored and\nI thought this might cheer him up. \"Either that or it's part\nof some incredibly deep plot.\"",
      "The Headmaster rose up from behind the desk, began to pace back\nand forth before the hatstand that held the Sorting Hat and the red\nslippers. \"Harry, do you not feel that all of this has gotten a\nbit...\"",
      "\"Awesome?\" offered Harry.",
      "\"Utterly and completely out of hand would say it\nbetter,\" said Dumbledore. \"I am not sure there has ever been a time\nin the whole history of this school when things have become so,\nso... I don't have a word for this, Harry, because things have\nnever become like this before, and so no one has ever needed to\ninvent a word for it.\"",
      "Harry would have tried to invent words to express how deeply\ncomplimented he felt, if he hadn't been snerkling too hard to\nspeak.",
      "The Headmaster was regarding him with increasing graveness.\n\"Harry, do you understand at all why I find these events\nconcerning?\"",
      "\"Honestly?\" said Harry. \"No, not really. I mean, of course\nProfessor McGonagall would object to anything that breaks up the\ndull monotony of the Hogwarts school experience. But then Professor\nMcGonagall wouldn't set a chicken on fire.\"",
      "The frown lines deepened on Dumbledore's wrinkled face. \"That,\nHarry, is not what disturbs me,\" the Headmaster said quietly.\n\"There was a full battle fought in these halls!\"",
      "\"Headmaster,\" Harry said, trying to keep his voice carefully\nrespectful, \"Professor Quirrell and I did not choose for that\nbattle to happen. The bullies did that. We just decided to\nhave the Light side win. I know there are times where the\nboundaries of morality are uncertain, but in this case the line\nseparating the villains and the heroines was twenty meters tall and\ndrawn in white fire. Our intervention may have been weird,\nbut it certainly wasn't wrong -\"",
      "Dumbledore had gone back to his desk, sat down in his padded\nthrone with a dull thump, and was now covering his face with both\nhis hands.",
      "\"Am I missing something here?\" Harry said. \"I thought you'd be\nsecretly on our side, Headmaster. It was the Gryffindor thing to\ndo. The Weasley twins would approve, Fawkes would approve\n-\" Harry glanced at the golden perch, but it was empty; either the\nphoenix had more important things to do, or the Headmaster hadn't\ninvited him to today's meeting.",
      "\"That,\" said the Headmaster in an old and tired and somewhat\nmuffled voice, \"is precisely the problem, Harry. There is a reason\nwhy courageous young heroes are not put in charge of schools.\"",
      "\"All right,\" Harry said. He couldn't quite keep the skepticism\nout of his voice. \"What am I missing this time?\"",
      "The old wizard lifted his head, his face now solemn, and calmer.\n\"Listen, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, \"hear me well; for all who wield\npower must learn this in time. Some things in this world are,\nindeed, truly simple. If you pick up a stone and drop it again, the\nearth will be no heavier for it, the stars will not move from their\npaths. I say this, Harry, so that you know I am not pretending to\nbe wise, when I tell you that even as some things are simple,\nothers are complex. There are greater wizardries which leave marks\nupon the world, and marks upon those who wield them, as a simple\nCharm would not. Those wizardries demand hesitation,\nconsideration of consequence, a moment to weigh the meaning of\ntheir marks. And yet the most intricate magics known to me are\nsimpler than the simplest soul. People, Harry, people are\nalways marked, by what they do and by what is done to them. Do you,\nthen, understand how to say, 'Here is the line between hero and\nvillain!' is not enough to say that what you did was right?\"",
      "\"Headmaster,\" Harry said evenly, \"this is not a decision I made\nat random. No, I don't know what exact effect this will have on\nevery single one of the bullies present. But if I always waited for\nperfect information before I acted, I would never do anything. When\nit comes to the future psychological development of, say, Peregrine\nDerrick, beating up eight first-year girls probably wouldn't have\nbeen good for him. And it wasn't enough to just stop them quietly\nand quickly, since then they would just try again later; they had\nto see that there was a protective power worth fearing.\" Harry's\nvoice stayed level. \"But of course, since I am a good guy,\nI didn't want to permanently injure them or even cause them any\npain; and yet the penalty had to be enough to weigh on the minds of\nanyone thinking about trying it again. So, after weighing the\nexpected outcomes as best I could with my boundedly rational\nintellect, I thought it would be wisest to strip the bullies naked\nand glue them to the ceiling.\"",
      "The young hero stared directly into the old wizard's gaze,\nunflinching green eyes locked with the blue behind the\nspectacles.",
      "And since I wasn't there and didn't do anything personally,\nthere's no lawful way to punish me under the Hogwarts school rules;\nthe only one who acted was Professor Quirrell, and he's fireproof.\nAnd just breaking the rules to get at me wouldn't be a wise thing\nto do to the hero you're grooming to fight Lord Voldemort...\nThis time Harry actually had tried to think through all\nthe ramifications in advance, before he'd made the suggestion to\nProfessor Quirrell; and for once the Defense Professor hadn't\ncalled him a fool, just slowly smiled and then begun to laugh.",
      "\"I understand your intentions, Harry,\" the old wizard said. \"You\nthink you have taught the bullies of Hogwarts a lesson. But if\nPeregrine Derrick could learn that lesson, he would not be\nPeregrine Derrick. He will only be provoked more by what you do -\nit is not fair, it is not right, but that is the way it is.\" The\nold wizard closed his eyes, as though in brief pain, and then\nopened them again. \"Harry, the most painful truth any hero must\nlearn is that the right cannot, should not, must not win every\nbattle. All of this began when Miss Granger fought three older\nenemies and won. If she had been content with this, the echoes of\nher deed would have died away in time. Yet instead she banded\ntogether with her classmates and raised her wand in open challenge\nto Peregrine Derrick and all his kind; and his kind cannot but\nraise their own wands in answer. So Jaime Astorga went hunting her,\nand in the natural course he would have beaten her; it would have\nbeen a sad day, but it would have ended there. There is not enough\nmagic in eight first-year witches all together to defeat such a\nfoe. But you could not accept that, Harry, could not let Miss\nGranger learn her own lessons; and so you sent the Defense\nProfessor to watch over them invisibly, and pierce Astorga's\nshields when Daphne Greengrass struck at him -\"",
      "What? thought Harry.",
      "The old wizard went on speaking. \"Each time you intervened,\nHarry, it escalated matters further and yet further. Soon Miss\nGranger was facing Robert Jugson himself, the son of a Death Eater,\nwith two strong allies at his side. Painful indeed it would have\nbeen for her, if Miss Granger had lost that battle. And yet again\nby your will and Quirinus's hand, this time shown more openly, she\nwon.\"",
      "Harry was still struggling with the notion of the Defense\nProfessor watching invisibly over S.P.H.E.W., guarding the heroines\nfrom harm.",
      "\"And so,\" the old wizard finished, \"that is how we came to\ntoday, Harry, to forty-four students attacking eight first-year\nwitches. A full battle in these halls! I know it was not your\nintent, but you must accept some measure of responsibility. Such\nthings did not happen before you came to this school, not through\nall my decades in Hogwarts; neither when I was a student nor when I\nwas a Professor.\"",
      "\"Thank you very much,\" Harry said evenly. \"Though I think\nProfessor Quirrell deserves more credit than me.\"",
      "The blue eyes widened. \"Harry...\"",
      "\"Those bullies were attacking victims long before this year,\"\nHarry said. Despite his best efforts, his voice was starting to\nrise. \"But nobody seems to have taught the students that they're\nallowed to fight back. I know it's much harder to\nignore a two-sided fight than some helpless victims\ngetting hexed or almost pushed out of windows, but it's not exactly\nworse, is it? I wish I'd read more of Godric Gryffindor's\nwritings so I could quote him, there's got to be something in there\nabout this. Open battle may be louder than the victims\nsuffering in silence, it may be harder to pretend that nothing is\nhappening, but the final result is better -\"",
      "\"No, it is not,\" Dumbledore said. \"It is not, Harry. To\nalways fight the darkness, to never let evil pass\nunchallenged - that is not heroism, but simple pride. Even Godric\nGryffindor did not think that every war was worth fighting, though\nhe went his whole life from one battle to another.\" The old\nwizard's voice went quieter. \"In truth, Harry, the words you speak\n- they are not evil. No, not evil, and yet they have frightened me.\nYou are one who might someday wield great power, over wizardry,\nover your fellow wizards. And if, come that day, you still think\nthat evil must never pass unchallenged -\" Now a note of real worry\nhad entered the Headmaster's voice. \"The world has grown more\nfragile since the age when Hogwarts was raised; I fear it cannot\nbear the fury of another Godric Gryffindor. And he was slower to\nhis wrath than you.\" The old wizard shook his head. \"You are too\nready to fight, Harry. Much too ready to fight, and Hogwarts itself\nis becoming a more violent place around you.\"",
      "\"Well,\" Harry said carefully, after weighing his words. \"I don't\nknow if it will help to say this, but I think you're getting the\nwrong impression of what I'm all about. I don't like real fighting\neither. It's scary, and violent, and somebody might get hurt. But I\ndidn't fight today, Headmaster.\"",
      "The Headmaster frowned. \"You sent the Defense Professor in your\nplace -\"",
      "\"Professor Quirrell didn't do any fighting either,\" Harry said\ncalmly. \"There wasn't anyone there strong enough to fight him. What\nhappened today wasn't fighting, it was winning.\"",
      "It was a while then before the old wizard spoke. \"That may be as\nit may be,\" the Headmaster said, \"but all these conflicts must end.\nI can hear the strain in the air, and with each of these clashes,\nit rises. All this must end, decisively and soon; you must not\nstand in the way of its ending.\"",
      "The old wizard gestured toward the great oaken door of his\noffice, and Harry departed through it.",
      "It was with some surprise that Harry stepped out from between\nthe huge grey gargoyles which had made way for him, and saw that\nQuirinus Quirrell was still slumped against the stone of the\ncorridor wall, a thick thread of spittle drooling from his slack\nmouth onto his Professorial robes, in just the same position he'd\noccupied when Harry had first gone up into the Headmaster's\noffice.",
      "Harry waited, but the slumped man didn't rise up; and after long\nawkward seconds, Harry began to walk down the corridor again.",
      "\"Mr. Potter?\" came a soft call, after Harry had turned two\ncorners; a quiet voice carrying unnaturally through the halls.",
      "When Harry had returned he found Professor Quirrell still\nslumped against the wall, but the pale eyes now watched him with\nkeen intelligence.",
      "I'm sorry to have tired you out -",
      "It was something that Harry couldn't say. He'd noticed the\ncorrelation between the effort Professor Quirrell expended and the\ntime he had to spend 'resting'. But Harry had reasoned that if the\neffort was too painful or detrimental, surely Professor Quirrell\nwould just say no. Now Harry was wondering if that reasoning had\nactually been correct, and if not, how to apologize...",
      "The Defense Professor spoke in a quiet voice, the rest of the\nbody unmoving. \"How went your meeting with the Headmaster, Mr.\nPotter?\"",
      "\"I'm not sure,\" Harry said. \"Not the way I predicted. He seems\nto believe the Light should lose a lot more often than I'd consider\nwise. Plus I'm not sure he understands the difference between\ntrying to fight and trying to win. It explains a lot, actually...\"\nHarry hadn't read much about the Wizarding War, but he'd read\nenough to know that the good guys probably had acquired a\npretty accurate picture of who most of the worst Death Eaters were,\nand hadn't just owled them all hand grenades over the\ncourse of five minutes.",
      "A soft, soft laugh from the pale lips. \"Dumbledore does not\ncomprehend the enjoyment of winning, just as he does not comprehend\nthe enjoyment of the game. Tell me, Mr. Potter. Did you suggest\nthis little plan with the deliberate intention of relieving my\ntedium?\"",
      "\"That was among my many motives,\" Harry said, because some\ninstinct had warned that he couldn't just say Yes.",
      "\"Do you know,\" the Defense Professor said in soft reflective\ntones, \"there are those who have tried to soften my darker moods,\nand those who have indeed participated in brightening my day, but\nyou are the first person ever to succeed in doing it deliberately?\"\nThe Defense Professor seemed to straighten up from the wall with a\npeculiar motion which might have included magic as well as muscle;\nand the Defense Professor began to walk away without a look back in\nHarry's direction. Only a single small gesture of one finger\nindicated that Harry was to follow.",
      "\"I particularly enjoyed that chant you composed for Miss Davis,\"\nsaid Professor Quirrell after they had walked a short distance.\n\"Though you might have been wiser to consult me in advance, before\ngiving it to her to memorize.\" One hand bestirred itself to within\nthe Defense Professor's robes and drew forth a wand, which traced a\nsmall gesture in the air, after which all the faraway sounds of the\ncastle Hogwarts fell silent. \"Tell me honestly, Mr. Potter, have\nyou somehow acquired a familiarity with the theory of Dark rituals?\nThat is not the same as confessing an intent to cast them; many\nwizards know the principles.\"",
      "\"No...\" Harry said slowly. He had decided some time ago against\ntrying to sneak into the Restricted Section of the Hogwarts\nlibrary, for much the same reason he'd decided a year earlier\nnot to look up how to make explosives out of common\nhousehold materials. Harry prided himself on at least having\nmore sense than people thought he did.",
      "\"Oh?\" said Professor Quirrell. The man was walking more normally\nnow, and the lips curved about in a peculiar smile. \"Why, perhaps\nyou possess a natural talent for the field, then.\"",
      "\"Yes, well,\" Harry said wearily. \"I suppose Dr. Seuss also has a\nnatural talent for Dark rituals, because the part about\nshuffle, duffle, muzzle, muff came from a children's book\ncalled Bartholomew and the Oobleck -\"",
      "\"No, not that part,\" said Professor Quirrell. His voice grew a\nlittle stronger, took on some of its normal lecturing tone. \"An\nordinary Charm, Mr. Potter, can be cast merely by speaking certain\nwords, making precise motions of the wand, expending some of your\nown strength. Even powerful spells may be invoked in this way, if\nthe magic is efficient as well as efficacious. But with the\ngreatest of magics, speech alone does not suffice to give them\nstructure. You must perform specific actions, make significant\nchoices. Nor is the temporary expenditure of your own strength\nsufficient to set them in motion; a ritual requires permanent\nsacrifice. The power of such a greater spell, compared to ordinary\nCharms, can be like day compared to night. But many rituals -\nindeed, most - happen to demand at least one sacrifice which might\ninspire squeamishness. And so the entire field of ritual magic,\ncontaining all the furthest and most interesting reaches of\nwizardry, is widely regarded as Dark. With a few exceptions carved\nout by tradition, of course.\" Professor Quirrell's voice took on a\nsardonic tinge. \"The Unbreakable Vow is too useful to certain\nwealthy Houses to be outlawed entirely - even though to bind a\nman's will through all his days is indeed a dread and terrible act,\nmore fearsome than many lesser rituals that wizards shun. A cynic\nmight conclude that which rituals are prohibited is not so much a\nmatter of morality, as habit. But I digress...\" Professor Quirrell\nmade a brief coughing sound, a clearing of his throat. \"The\nUnbreakable Vow requires three participants and three sacrifices.\nThe one who receives the Unbreakable Vow must be one who could have\ncome to trust the Vower, but chooses instead to demand the Vow from\nthem, and they sacrifice that possibility of trust. The one who\nmakes the Vow must be someone who could have chosen to do what the\nVow demands of them, and they sacrifice that capacity for choice.\nAnd the third wizard, the binder, permanently sacrifices a small\nportion of their own magic, to sustain the Vow forever.\"",
      "\"Ah,\" Harry said. \"I'd wondered why that spell wasn't\nused all over the place, every time two people have difficulty\ntrusting each other... although... why don't wizards on their\ndeathbeds charge money to bind Unbreakable Vows, and use that to\nleave an inheritance for their children -\"",
      "\"Because they are stupid,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"There are\nhundreds of useful rituals which could be performed if men had so\nmuch sense; I could name twenty without stopping to draw breath.\nBut in any case, Mr. Potter, the thing about such rituals - whether\nor not you choose to term them Dark - is that they are shaped to be\nmagically efficacious, not to appear impressive when performed. I\nsuppose there is a certain tendency for the more powerful rituals\nto require more dreadful sacrifices. Even so, the most terrible\nritual known to me demands only a rope which has hanged a man and a\nsword which has slain a woman; and that for a ritual which promised\nto summon Death itself - though what is truly meant by that I do\nnot know and do not care to discover, since it was also said that\nthe counterspell to dismiss Death had been lost. The most dread\nchant I have encountered does not sound even a hundredth as\nfearsome as the chant you composed for Miss Davis. Those among the\nbullies who had a passing familiarity with Dark rituals - and I am\ncertain that there were some - must have been terrified beyond the\ncapacity of words to describe. If there existed a true ritual which\nappeared that impressive, Mr. Potter, it would melt the Earth.\"",
      "\"Um,\" said Harry.",
      "Professor Quirrell's lips twisted further. \"Ah, but the truly\namusing thing was this. You see, Mr. Potter, the chant of every\nritual names that which is to be sacrificed, and that which is to\nbe gained. The chant which you gave to Miss Davis spoke, first, of\na darkness beyond darkness, buried beneath the flow of time, which\nknows the gate, and is the gate. And the second thing spoken of,\nMr. Potter, was the manifestation of your own presence. And always,\nin each element of the ritual, first is named that which\nis sacrificed, and then is said the use commanded of\nit.\"",
      "\"I... see,\" said Harry, as he trod through the halls of Hogwarts\nafter Professor Quirrell, following him toward the Defense\nProfessor's office. \"So my chant, the way I wrote it, implies that\nthe Outer God, Yog-Sothoth -\"",
      "\"Was permanently sacrificed in a ritual which but briefly\nmanifested your presence,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"I suppose we\nwill discover tomorrow whether anyone took that seriously, when we\nread the newspapers and see whether all the magical nations of the\nworld are banding together in a desperate effort to seal off your\nincursion into our reality.\"",
      "They walked on, as the Defense Professor began chuckling, odd\nthroaty sounds.",
      "The two of them didn't talk after that until they came to the\nDefense Professor's office, and then the man halted with his hand\nupon the door.",
      "\"It is a very strange thing,\" the Defense Professor said, his\nvoice now soft again, almost inaudible. The man was not looking at\nHarry, and Harry saw only his back. \"A very strange thing... There\nwas a time when I would have sacrificed a finger from my wand hand,\nto work upon the bullies of Hogwarts as we have worked upon them\nthis day. To make them fear me as they now fear you, to have the\ndeference of all the students and the adoration of many, I would\nhave given my finger for that. You have everything now that I\nwanted then. All that I know of human nature says that I should\nhate you. And yet I do not. It is a very strange thing.\"",
      "It should have been a touching moment, but instead Harry felt a\ncoldness traveling down his spine, as though he were a little fish\nin the sea, and some vast white shark had just looked him over and\ndecided after a visible hesitation not to eat him.",
      "The man opened the door to Defense Professor's office, and\npassed within, and was gone.",
      "Aftermath:",
      "Her fellow Slytherins were looking at Daphne like... like they\ndidn't have the faintest idea of how to look at her.",
      "The Gryffindors were looking at her like they didn't have the\nfaintest idea of how to look at her.",
      "Showing no fear, Daphne Greengrass strode into the Potions\nclassroom, wrapped in the imperious dignity of a Noble and Most\nAncient House. Inside she was feeling much the same way everyone\nelse probably did.",
      "It had been two hours since the What? when the\nWhat? had happened and Daphne's brain was still going:\nWhat? What? What?",
      "The classroom was quiet as they all waited for Professor Snape\nto arrive. Lavender and Parvati sat near a cluster of other\nGryffindors, surrounded by silent stares. The two of them were\nlooking over each other's homework before class started, and nobody\nelse was helping them or talking to them. Even Lavender, who Daphne\nwould have sworn could never be fazed by anything, seemed\nsubdued.",
      "Daphne sat down at her desk, and took Magical Draughts and\nPotions out of her bag, and began looking over her own\nhomework, doing her very best to act normal. People stared at her,\nand said nothing -",
      "A gasp went through the whole classroom. Girls and boys flinched\nback, leaning away from the door like they were stalks of wheat\ntouched by a gust of wind.",
      "In the door stood Tracey Davis, wrapped in a black tattered\ncloak which had been draped over her Hogwarts uniform.",
      "Tracey walked slowly into the classroom, swaying slightly with\neach step, looking like she was trying to drift. She sat\ndown at her accustomed desk, which happened to be right next to\nDaphne's.",
      "Slowly Tracey's head turned to stare at Daphne.",
      "\"See?\" the Slytherin girl said in a low, sepulchral tone. \"I\ntold you I'd get him before she did.\"",
      "\"What?\" blurted Daphne, who immediately wished she hadn't said\nanything.",
      "\"I got Harry Potter before Granger did.\" Tracey's voice was\nstill low, but her eyes were gleaming with triumph. \"See, Daphne,\nwhat General Potter wants in a girl isn't a pretty face or a pretty\ndress. He wants a girl willing to channel his dread powers, that's\nwhat he wants. Now I'm his - and he's mine!\"",
      "This announcement produced a frozen silence through the whole\nclassroom.",
      "\"Excuse me, Miss Davis,\" said the cultured voice of Draco\nMalfoy, who seemed unconcerned as he shuffled through his own\nPotions parchments. The other scion of a Most Ancient House didn't\nso much as glance up from his desk, even as everyone else turned to\nlook at him. \"Did Harry Potter actually tell you that?\nUsing those words?\"",
      "\"Well, no...\" Tracey said, and then her eyes flashed angrily.\n\"But he'd better take me in, now that I've sacrificed my\nsoul to him and everything!\"",
      "\"You sacrificed your soul to Harry Potter?\u202f\" gasped\nMillicent. There was a clatter from the other side of the room as\nRon Weasley dropped his inkwell.",
      "\"Well, I'm pretty sure I did,\" said Tracey, sounding briefly\nuncertain before she rallied. \"I mean, I looked at myself in a\nmirror and I look paler now, and I can always feel darkness\nsurrounding me, and I was a conduit for his dread powers and\neverything... Daphne, you also saw my eyes go green, right? I\ndidn't see it myself but that's what I heard afterward.\"",
      "There was a pause, broken only by the sounds of Ron Weasley\ntrying to clean up his desk.",
      "\"Daphne?\" said Tracey.",
      "\"I don't believe it,\" said an angry voice. \"There's no way the\nnext Dark Lord would take you to be his bride!\"",
      "Slowly, and with considerable disbelief, heads turned to stare\nat Pansy Parkinson.",
      "\"Hush, you,\" said Tracey, \"or I'll...\" The Slytherin girl\npaused. Then Tracey's voice went even lower, and she said, \"Hush,\nyou, or I'll devour your soul.\"",
      "\"You can't do that,\" said Pansy, in the confident tones of a hen\nwhich had worked out a perfectly good pecking order where she was\nat the top, and wasn't about to go updating that belief based on\nmere evidence.",
      "Slowly, like she was trying to float, Tracey got up from her\ndesk. There were more gasps. Daphne felt like she'd been Petrified\nin place within her chair.",
      "\"Tracey?\" said Lavender in a small voice. \"Please don't do all\nthat again. Please?\"",
      "Now Pansy was showing definite nervousness as Tracey swayed\ntoward her desk. \"What d'you think you're doing?\" Pansy said, not\nquite managing to sound indignant.",
      "\"I told you,\" Tracey said menacingly. \"I'm going to devour your\nsoul.\"",
      "Tracey bent down over Pansy, who sat frozen at her desk; and,\nwith their lips almost touching, made a loud inhaling noise.",
      "\"There!\" said Tracey as she straightened. \"I ate your soul.\"",
      "\"No you didn't!\" said Pansy.",
      "\"Did too!\" said Tracey.",
      "There was a very slight pause -",
      "\"Merlin, she did!\u202f\" cried Theodore Nott. \"You look all\npale now, and your eyes seem empty!\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" screeched Pansy, turning pale. The girl leapt\nup from her desk and began frantically rummaging through her\nbookbag. After Pansy drew out a mirror and looked at herself, she\nturned even paler.",
      "Daphne abandoned all pretense of aristocratic poise and let her\nhead fall to the desk with a dull thud, as she wondered whether\ngoing to the same school as all the other important families was\nreally worth going to the same school as the Chaos Legion.",
      "\"Ooh, you're in trouble now, Pansy,\" said Seamus Finnigan. \"I\ndon't know exactly what happens when a Dementor Kisses you, but if\nTracey Davis kisses you that's probably even worse.\"",
      "\"I've heard about people without souls,\" Dean Thomas said\ngloomily. \"They have to dress all in black, and they write awful\npoetry, and nothing ever makes them happy. They're all\nangsty.\"",
      "\"I don't want to be angsty!\" cried Pansy.",
      "\"Too bad,\" said Dean Thomas. \"You've got to be, now that your\nsoul's gone.\"",
      "Pansy turned, and stretched out a begging hand toward Draco\nMalfoy's desk. \"Draco!\" she said pleadingly. \"Mr. Malfoy! Please,\nmake Tracey give me back my soul!\"",
      "\"I can't,\" said Tracey. \"I ate it.\"",
      "\"Make her throw it up!\" yelled Pansy.",
      "The heir of Malfoy had slumped forward, resting his head in both\nhands, so that nobody could see his face. \"Why is my life like\nthis?\" said Draco Malfoy.",
      "A wild babble of whispers started up as Tracey returned to her\ndesk, now smiling in satisfaction, while Pansy stood in the midst\nof the classroom, wringing her hands and tears starting from her\neyes -",
      "\"Be. Quiet.\"",
      "The soft, lethal voice seemed to fill the whole classroom as\nProfessor Snape stalked in through the door. His face was angrier\nthan Daphne had ever seen it, sending a jolt of genuine fear down\nher spine. Hastily she looked down at her homework.",
      "\"Sit down, Parkinson,\" the Potions Master hissed, \"and you,\nDavis, take off that ridiculous cloak -\"",
      "\"Professor Snaaaaaape!\u202f\" wailed Pansy Parkinson in\ntears. \"Tracey ate my sooouuul!\u202f\""

      "It was a looping, meandering alley in the midst of Hogwarts,\nwandering like a stray lock of hair; sometimes crossing itself, it\nseemed, but you couldn't ever get to the end if you gave into the\ntemptation of apparent shortcuts.",
      "At the end of the tangle, six students leaned against rough\nstones, robes black against the grey walls and trimmed in green,\neyes darting from one to each other. Torches burned in the\nwindowless sconce, casting light to ward off the darkness and heat\nto ward off the chill of the Slytherin dungeons.",
      "\"I am certain,\" Reese Belka snapped, \"absolutely\ncertain, that was no true ritual. Little firstie witches\ncan't do that kind of magic, and even if they could, who's ever\nheard of a Dark ritual which sacrifices a sealed horror\nfor - that?\u202f\"",
      "\"Were you -\" said Lucian Bole. \"I mean - after that girl snapped\nher fingers -\"",
      "Belka's glare should have melted him. \"No,\" she spat, \"I was\nnot.\"",
      "\"That is, she wasn't naked,\" drawled Marcus Flint, his broad\nshoulders leaning back in apparent relaxation against the lumpy\nstone surface. \"Covered in chocolate frosting, yes, but not\nnaked.\"",
      "\"This day Potter has offered great insult to our Houses,\" said\nthe grim voice of Jaime Astorga.",
      "\"Yes, well, I'm sorry to be blunt,\" Randolph Lee said evenly.\nThe seventh-year duelist rubbed at his chin, where a faint fuzz of\nbeard had been allowed to grow. \"But when someone sticks you to the\nceiling, it's a message, Astorga. It's a message which says: I'm an\nincredibly powerful Dark Wizard who could've done anything to you I\ndamn well pleased, and I don't care if your House is offended,\neither.\"",
      "Robert Jugson III gave a soft, low laugh at this, a chuckle that\nsent chills down several spines. \"It makes you wonder if you picked\nthe wrong side, doesn't it? I've heard tales about\nmessages like that, sent at the old Dark Lord's\nbidding...\"",
      "\"I'm not ready to kneel to Potter just yet,\" said Astorga,\nstaring hard into Jugson's eyes.",
      "\"Neither am I,\" said Belka.",
      "Jugson was holding his wand, and he turned it idly back and\nforth in his fingers, pointing it up and then downward. \"Are you a\nGryffindor or a Slytherin?\" said Jugson. \"Everyone's got a price.\nEveryone smart.\"",
      "This statement produced a moment of silence.",
      "\"Shouldn't Malfoy be here?\" Bole said tentatively.",
      "Flint gave a dismissive flick of his fingers. \"Whatever Malfoy's\nplotting, he wants to put on an air of innocence. He can't be seen\nmissing at the same time as us.\"",
      "\"But everyone knows that already,\" said Bole. \"Even in\nthe other Houses.\"",
      "\"Yes, very clumsy,\" said Belka. She snorted. \"Malfoy or no, he's\njust a little firstie and we don't need him here.\"",
      "\"I will owl my father,\" Jugson said softly, \"and he\nwill speak to Lord Malfoy himself -\" Abruptly, Jugson stopped\nspeaking.",
      "\"I don't know about you, dearies,\" Belka said with fake\nsweetness, \"but I don't plan on running scared from a\nfalse ritual, and I'm not done with Potter and his pet\nmudblood.\"",
      "Nobody answered. All their gazes were looking past her.",
      "Slowly, Belka turned around to see what the others were staring\nat.",
      "\"You will do nothing,\" hissed their Head of House.\nSeverus Snape's face was enraged, when he spoke small spots of\nspittle flew from his mouth, further dotting his already-dirtied\nrobes. \"You fools have done enough! You have embarrassed\nmy House - lost to first-years - now you speak of\nembroiling noble Lords of the Wizengamot in your pathetic\nchildish squabbles? I shall deal with this matter.\nYou will not embarrass this House again, you will not\nrisk embarrassing this House again! You are done\nwith fighting witches, and if I hear otherwise -\"",
      "If you thought they'd be sitting next to each other at\ndinnertime, after that, you'd be quite mistaken.",
      "\"What does she want from me?\" came the plaintive cry of\na boy who, for all his extensive reading in the scientific\nliterature, was still a bit naive about certain things. \"Did she\nwant to get beaten up?\"",
      "The upper-year Ravenclaw boys who'd sat down next to him at the\ndinner-table exchanged swift glances with each other until, by some\nunspoken protocol, the most experienced of their number spoke.",
      "\"Look,\" said Arty Grey, the seventh-year who was leading in\ntheir competition by three witches and a Defense Professor, \"the\nthing you've got to understand is, just because she's\nangry doesn't mean you lost points. Miss Granger is angry\nbecause she got all frightened and you're there to be\nblamed, you understand? But at the same time, even though she\nwon't admit it, she'll be touched that her boyfriend went to such\nridiculous and frankly insane lengths to protect her.\"",
      "\"This is not about points,\" ground out Harry Potter,\nthe words visibly escaping from between his clenched teeth. Dinner\nsat ignored on the table in front of him. \"This is about\njustice. And I. Am. Not. Her. Boyfriend!\u202f\"",
      "This was met by a certain amount of sniggering from all\npresent.",
      "\"Yeah, well,\" said a sixth-year Ravenclaw boy, \"I think after\nshe kisses you to bring you out of Dementation and you stick\nforty-four bullies to the ceiling for her, we've gone way past\n'she's not my girlfriend, really' and into the question of what\nyour kids will be like. Wow, that's a scary thought...\" The\nRavenclaw trailed off and then said, in a smaller voice, \"Please\ndon't look at me like that.\"",
      "\"Look,\" said Arty Grey, \"I'm sorry to be blunt about this, but\nyou can have justice or you can have girls, you can't have both at\nthe same time.\" He clapped a companionable hand on Harry Potter's\nshoulder. \"You've got potential, kid, more potential than any\nwizard I've ever seen, but you've got to learn how to use\nit, you know? Be a bit sweeter to them, learn some spells to clean\nup that mess you call hair. Above all, you need to hide your\nevilness better - not too well, but better. Nice\nwell-groomed boys get girls, and Dark Wizards also get girls, but\nnice well-groomed boys suspected of being secretly Dark\nget more girls than you can imagine -\"",
      "\"Not interested,\" Harry said flatly, as he picked up the boy's\nhand from his shoulder and unceremoniously dropped it.",
      "\"But you will be,\" said Arty Grey, his voice low and foreboding.\n\"Ah, you will be!\"",
      "Elsewhere along the same table -",
      "\"Romantic?\u202f\" shrieked Hermione Granger, so loudly that\nsome of the girls next to her winced. \"What part of that was\nromantic? He didn't ask! He never asks! He\njust sends ghosts after people and glues them to ceilings and does\nwhatever he wants with my life!\"",
      "\"But don't you see?\" said a fourth-year witch. \"It means that\neven though he's evil, he loves you!\"",
      "\"You're not helping,\" said Penelope Clearwater a little further\ndown the table, but she was ignored. Several older witches had\nstarted toward Hermione, after she'd sat down at the extreme\nopposite end of the table from Harry Potter, but then a swifter\ncloud of younger girls had surrounded Hermione in an impenetrable\nbarrier.",
      "\"Boys,\" said Hermione Granger, \"should not be allowed to love\ngirls without asking them first! This is true in a number of ways\nand especially when it comes to gluing people to the ceiling!\"",
      "This was also ignored. \"It's just like a play!\" sighed a\nthird-year girl.",
      "\"A play?\" said Hermione. \"I'd like to see the play where\nanything like this happens!\"",
      "\"Oh,\" said the third-year girl, \"I was thinking of that really\nromantic one where there's this very nice, sweet boy who\nmakes a Floo call, only he mispronounces his destination and\nstumbles out into this room full of Dark Wizards who are performing\na forbidden ritual that should've stayed forever lost to time, and\nthey're sacrificing seven victims in order to unseal this ancient\nhorror which is supposed to grant someone a wish if it's freed, so\nof course the boy's presence interrupts the ritual, and as the\nhorror is eating all the Dark Wizards and everyone is dying the\nboy's last thought is that he wishes he could've had a girlfriend,\nand the next thing you know the boy is lying in the lap of this\nbeautiful woman whose eyes are burning with a dreadful light, only\nshe doesn't understand anything about being human so the boy always\nhas to stop her eating people. This is just like that play, only\nyou're the boy and Harry Potter is the girl!\"",
      "\"That...\" Hermione said, feeling quite surprised. \"That actually\ndoes sound something like -\"",
      "\"It does?\u202f\" blurted a second-year girl sitting across\nthe table, who was now leaning forward, looking horrified and yet\neven more fascinated.",
      "\"No!\" said Hermione. \"I mean - he's not my\nboyfriend!\u202f\"",
      "Two seconds later, Hermione's ears caught up with what her lips\nhad just said.",
      "The fourth-year witch put her hand on Hermione's shoulder and\ngave her a comforting squeeze. \"Miss Granger,\" she said in a\nsoothing voice, \"I think if you're really honest with yourself,\nyou'll admit that the real reason you're angry with your dark\nmaster is that he channeled his unspeakable powers through Tracey\nDavis instead of you.\"",
      "Hermione's mouth opened but her throat locked up before the\nwords came out, which was probably a good thing, because if she'd\nactually yelled that loudly it would've broken something.",
      "\"How's that possible, actually?\" said the third-year girl. \"I\nmean for Harry Potter to work through another girl even though he's\nbound himself to you? Do the three of you have one of those, you\nknow, arrangements?\"",
      "\"Gaaaaack,\" said Hermione Granger, her throat still\nlocked, her brain halted, and her vocal cords spontaneously making\na noise like she was coughing up a yak.",
      "(Later.)",
      "\"I don't understand why you're being so unreasonable,\"\nsaid another second-year witch, who'd replaced the third-year-girl\nafter Hermione had threatened to ask Tracey to eat her soul. \"I\nmean, really, if someone like Harry Potter rescued me, I'd\nbe - sending him thank-you cards, and hugging him, and,\" the girl's\nface was a bit red, \"well, kissing him, I'd hope.\"",
      "\"Yeah!\" said the other second-year witch. \"I've never understood\nwhy girls in plays get angry when the main character goes\nout of his way to be nice to them. I wouldn't act like\nthat if the hero liked me.\"",
      "Hermione Granger had dropped her head to the dinner table, her\nhands slowly pulling at her hair.",
      "\"You just don't understand male psychology,\" the fourth-year\nwitch said in an authoritative voice. \"Granger's got to make it\nlook like she can mysteriously resist his seductive\ncharm.\"",
      "(Even later.)",
      "And so before long Hermione Granger had turned to the only\nperson left she could talk to, the only person guaranteed to\nunderstand her point of view -",
      "\"They're all mad,\" said Hermione Granger as she strode\nvigorously toward Ravenclaw tower, having left dinner a bit early.\n\"Everyone except you and me, Harry, I mean everyone except\nus in this whole school of Hogwarts, they're all entirely\nmad. And Ravenclaw girls are the worst, I don't\nknow what Ravenclaw girls go reading when they get older,\nbut I'm certain they ought not to be reading it. One witch asked me\nif the two of us had soul-bonded, which I'm going to look up in the\nlibrary tonight, but I'm pretty sure has never actually happened\n-\"",
      "\"I don't even know a name for this kind of fallacious\nreasoning,\" said Harry Potter. The boy was walking normally, which\nmeant he often had to skip forward a few steps to match her own\nindignation-fueled speed. \"I seriously think if it was up to\nthem, they'd be dragging us off this minute to get our\nnames changed to Potter-Evans-Verres-Granger... Ugh, saying that\nout loud makes me realize how awful it sounds.\"",
      "\"You mean your name would be\nPotter-Evans-Verres-Granger and mine would be\nGranger-Potter-Evans-Verres,\" said Hermione. \"It's too horrible to\nimagine.\"",
      "\"No,\" said the boy, \"House Potter is a Noble House, so I think\nthat name stays in front -\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" she said indignantly. \"Who says we\nhave to -\"",
      "There was a sudden awful silence, broken only by the thuds of\ntheir shoes.",
      "\"Anyhow,\" Hermione said hastily, \"some of the crazy\nthings they said at dinner got me thinking, so I just want to say,\nHarry, that I really am grateful to you for saving me and everybody\nfrom getting beat up, and even though some parts of this afternoon\nupset me, I'm sure we can just talk about it calmly.\"",
      "\"Ah...\" Harry said with a faint and tentative smile, his eyes\nshowing a mixture of befuddlement and apprehension, \"that's...\ngood, I guess?\"",
      "To be specific, there'd been the fourth-year witch explaining\nthat, since Harry was the evil wizard who'd fallen in love with\nHermione, and Hermione was the pure and innocent girl who would\neither redeem him or get seduced by the Dark Arts herself, it\nfollowed that Hermione had to be perpetually indignant at\nanything Harry did, even if it was him heroically saving her from\ncertain doom, just so that their romance wouldn't resolve itself\nbefore the end of Act IV. And then Penelope Clearwater,\nwho Hermione had really thought was smarter than that, had remarked\nin a loud voice that for identical reasons it was\nimpossible for Hermione to just go over and talk sensibly\nwith Harry about why she was feeling hurt, and anyway Dark Wizards\nwere attracted to passionate defiance in a woman, not logic. This\nwas the point at which Hermione had shoved herself up from the\nbenches, stomped furiously over to where Harry was sitting, and\nasked him in a reasonable voice if the two of them could go for a\nwalk and sort things out.",
      "\"So in other words,\" Hermione said in her calmest voice ever,\n\"you're not really in trouble with me, I'm still talking to you,\nwe're still friends, and we're still studying together. We're\nnot having a fight. Right?\"",
      "Somehow this only seemed to increase Harry Potter's\napprehension. \"Right,\" said the Boy-Who-Lived.",
      "\"Great!\" said Hermione. \"So, have you worked out why I\nwas upset, Mr. Potter?\"",
      "There was a pause. \"You wanted me to keep out of your affairs?\"\nHarry said cautiously. \"I mean - I know you wanted to do things on\nyour own. And I was staying out of your way, until I'd\nheard you'd gotten ambushed by three junior Death Eaters and,\nhonestly, I wasn't expecting that. Professor Quirrell\nwasn't expecting that. I started to worry you'd gotten in over your\nhead and then, no offense Hermione, forty-four bullies in a massed\nambush is way beyond what anyone could handle without\nhelp. That's why I thought you really needed help just that once\n-\"",
      "\"No, that part's fine,\" said Hermione. \"We were in over\nour heads, honestly. Please guess again, Mr. Potter.\"",
      "\"Um,\" said Harry. \"What Tracey did... startled you?\"",
      "\"Startled me, Mr. Potter?\" There might have been a touch of\nacidity in her voice. \"No, Mr. Potter, I was scared. I was\nfrightened. I wouldn't want to admit to being afraid of\njust dragons or something, people might think I was\ncowardly, but when you can hear distant voices crying\n'Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!' and there's pools of blood seeping out from\nunder all the doors, then it's okay to be scared.\"",
      "\"I am sorry,\" Harry said with what sounded like genuine\nregret. \"I thought you'd realize it was me.\"",
      "\"And the reason we all got scared like that, Mr.\nPotter, was that you didn't ask first!\u202f\" Despite her\nintentions, Hermione found her voice was rising again. \"You\nshould've asked me before you did something like that,\nHarry! You should've said very specifically, 'Hermione, can I make\nblood come out from under the doors?' It's important to be specific\nwhen you're asking about that sort of thing!\"",
      "The boy rubbed the back of his neck as he walked. \"I...\nhonestly, I just thought you'd have to say no.\"",
      "\"Yes, Mr. Potter, I could've said no. That's the\nwhole point of asking first, Mr. Potter!\"",
      "\"No, I mean you'd have had to say no, whether or not it\nwas what you really wanted. And then all of you would've\ngotten beaten up and it would've been my fault for asking\nfirst.\"",
      "Hermione's eyebrows went up in a bit of surprise, and she kept\nwalking for a few steps while she tried to understand this. \"What?\"\nshe said.",
      "\"Well...\" the boy said a bit slowly. \"I mean... you're the\nSunshine General, aren't you? You couldn't say yes to me\nscaring people, not even bullies, not even to save your friends\nfrom getting beaten up. You would've had to say no, and\nthen you would've gotten hurt. This way, you can tell people\nhonestly that you had no idea and that it wasn't your fault. That's\nwhy I didn't warn you.\"",
      "Hermione stopped walking, turned to face Harry full on instead\nof just turning her head. Her voice was carefully even as she said,\n\"Harry, you've got to stop coming up with clever reasons\nfor doing stupid things.\"",
      "Harry's eyebrows flew up. After a moment he said, \"Look... I\nknow what you mean, of course, but there's still the question of\nwhether it's actually is a good idea, not just a clever\none -\"",
      "\"I understand why you did what you did today,\" Hermione said.\n\"But I want you to promise that from now on, you'll ask me first,\nalways, even if you can come up with a reason why you\nshouldn't.\"",
      "There was a pause that stretched, and Hermione could feel her\nheart sinking.",
      "\"Hermione -\" Harry started to say.",
      "\"Why?\u202f\" The frustration burst out into her voice.\n\"Why is it so awful? All you have to do is ask!\"",
      "Harry's eyes were very serious. \"Who in S.P.H.E.W. do you try\nhardest to defend, Hermione? Who are you most afraid for, when you\nfight?\"",
      "\"Hannah Abbott,\" Hermione said without having to think about it,\nand then felt a little bad, because Hannah was trying hard\nand she had improved a lot -",
      "\"Would you feel okay about trusting someone else, like Tracey,\nwith final responsibility for protecting Hannah? If you\nknew Hannah was about to walk into an ambush, and you came up with\na plan for protecting her, would you feel good about letting Tracey\nsay whether or not you were allowed to do it?\"",
      "\"Well... no?\" said Hermione, puzzled.",
      "The green eyes of the Boy-Who-Lived were steady on hers. \"Would\nyou trust Hannah to have the final say in whether she\nneeded protecting?\"",
      "\"I -\" said Hermione, and then paused. It was strange, she knew\nthe right answer and she also knew the right answer wasn't actually\ntrue. Hannah was trying so hard to prove she wasn't afraid, even\nthough she was, and it was easy to see how the Hufflepuff\ngirl might try too hard -",
      "Then Hermione realized the implication. \"You think I'm like\nHannah?\u202f\"",
      "\"Not... exactly...\" Harry ran his hands through his mess of\nhair. \"Listen, Hermione, what would you have suggested\ndoing, if I'd warned you about an ambush by forty-four\nbullies?\"",
      "\"I would've done the responsible thing and told\nProfessor McGonagall and let her take care of\nit,\" Hermione said promptly. \"And then there wouldn't have\nbeen darkness and people screaming and horrible blue light -\"",
      "But Harry just shook his head. \"That's not the\nresponsible thing to do, Hermione. It's what someone playing the\nrole of a responsible girl would do. Yes, I\nthought of going to Professor McGonagall. But she would've only\nstopped the disaster once. Probably before any disturbance\nhappened in the first place, like by telling the bullies she knew.\nIf the bullies got punished just for plotting, it would be by\nlosing House points, or at worst a day's detention, not anything\nthat would really scare them. And then the bullies would have\ntried again. Fewer of them, with better operational\nsecurity so I didn't hear about it. They would probably ambush\none of you, alone. Professor McGonagall doesn't have the\nauthority to do something scary enough to protect you -\nand she wouldn't have overstepped her authority, because\nshe's not really responsible.\"",
      "\"Professor McGonagall isn't responsible?\" Hermione said\nincredulously. She jammed her hands on her hips, now openly glaring\nat him. \"Are you nuts?\"",
      "The boy didn't blink. \"You could call it heroic responsibility,\nmaybe,\" Harry Potter said. \"Not like the usual sort. It means that\nwhatever happens, no matter what, it's always your fault.\nEven if you tell Professor McGonagall, she's not responsible for\nwhat happens, you are. Following the school rules isn't an\nexcuse, someone else being in charge isn't an excuse, even trying\nyour best isn't an excuse. There just aren't any excuses, you've\ngot to get the job done no matter what.\" Harry's face\ntightened. \"That's why I say you're not thinking responsibly,\nHermione. Thinking that your job is done when you tell Professor\nMcGonagall - that isn't heroine thinking. Like Hannah being beat up\nis okay then, because it isn't your fault\nanymore. Being a heroine means your job isn't finished until you've\ndone whatever it takes to protect the other girls,\npermanently.\" In Harry's voice was a touch of the steel he\nhad acquired since the day Fawkes had been on his shoulder. \"You\ncan't think as if just following the rules means you've done your\nduty.\"",
      "\"I think,\" Hermione said evenly, \"that you and I might disagree\nabout some things, Mr. Potter. Like whether you or Professor\nMcGonagall is more responsible, and whether being\nresponsible usually involves people running around and\nscreaming, and how much it's a good idea to follow school rules.\nAnd just because we disagree, Mr. Potter, doesn't mean that\nyou get the final say.\"",
      "\"Well,\" said Harry, \"you asked what was so awful about\nhaving to ask you first, and it was a surprisingly good question,\nso I examined my mind and that's what I found. I think my real fear\nis that if Hannah is in trouble and I come up with a way to save\nher that seems weird or dark or something, you might not weigh the\nconsequences to Hannah. You might not accept the heroine's\nresponsibility of coming up with some way to save her,\nsomehow, no matter what. Instead you'd just carry out the\nrole of Hermione Granger, the sensible Ravenclaw girl; and\nthe role of Hermione Granger automatically says no,\nwhether or not she has a better plan in mind. And then forty-four\nbullies will take turns beating up Hannah Abbott, and it'll all be\nmy fault because I knew, even if I didn't want reality to\nbe that way, I knew that was how it would go. I'm pretty sure that\nwas my secret, wordless, unutterable fear.\"",
      "The frustration was building up inside her again. \"It's\nmy life!\" Hermione burst out. She could imagine what it\nwould be like with Harry messing with her all the time, constantly\ninventing justifications not to ask her first and not to listen to\nher objections. She shouldn't have to win an argument just\nto - \"There'll always be some reason, you can\nalways say I'm not thinking right! I want my own\nlife! Otherwise I'll walk away, I really will, I mean it\nHarry.\"",
      "Harry sighed. \"This is exactly where I didn't want things to end\nup, and here we are. You're afraid of just the same thing I am,\naren't you? Afraid that if you let go of the steering\nwheel, we'll crash.\" The corners of his lips twisted, but it didn't\nlook like a real smile. \"That's something I can understand.\"",
      "\"I don't think you understand at all!\u202f\" Hermione said\nsharply. \"You said we'd be partners, Harry!\"",
      "That stopped him, she could see it stop him.",
      "\"How about this?\" Harry said at last. \"I'll promise to ask you\nfirst before I do anything that could be interpreted as meddling in\nyour affairs. Only you've got to promise me to be\nreasonable, Hermione. I mean really, genuinely, stop and\nthink for twenty seconds first, treat it as a real choice. The sort\nof reasonableness where you realize I'm offering a way to protect\nthe other girls, and that if you automatically say no\nwithout considering it properly, there's this actual\nconsequence where Hannah Abbott ends up in the hospital.\"",
      "Hermione stared at Harry, as his recitation wound down.",
      "\"Well?\" said Harry.",
      "\"I shouldn't have to make promises,\" she said, \"just to be\nconsulted about my own life.\" She turned from\nHarry and began walking toward the Ravenclaw tower, not looking at\nhim. \"But I'll think about it, anyway.\"",
      "She heard Harry sigh, and after that they walked in silence for\na while, passing through an archway of some reddish metal like\ncopper, into a corridor that was just like the one they'd left\nexcept that it was tiled in pentagons instead of squares.",
      "\"Hermione...\" said Harry. \"I've been watching you and thinking,\nsince the day you said you were going to be a hero. You've\ngot the courage. You'll fight for what's right, even in\nthe face of enemies that would scare other people away. You've\ncertainly got the raw intelligence for it, and you're probably a\nbetter person inside than I am. But even so... well, to be honest,\nHermione... I can't quite see you filling Dumbledore's shoes,\nleading magical Britain's fight against You-Know-Who. Not yet,\nanyway.\"",
      "Hermione had turned her head to stare at Harry, who just went on\nwalking, as though lost in thought. Fill those shoes?\nShe'd never tried to imagine herself that way. She'd never\nimagined imagining herself that way.",
      "\"And maybe I'm wrong,\" Harry said as they walked. \"Maybe I've\njust read too many stories where the heroes never do the sensible\nthing and follow the rules and tell their Professor McGonagalls, so\nmy brain doesn't think you're a proper storybook hero. Maybe it's\nyou who's the sane one, Hermione, and me who's just being silly.\nBut every time you talk about following rules or relying on\nteachers, I get that same feeling, like it's bound up with this one\nlast thing that's stopping you, one last thing that puts your PC\nself to sleep and turns you into an NPC again...\" Harry let out a\nsigh. \"Maybe that's why Dumbledore said I should have wicked\nstepparents.\"",
      "\"He said what?\u202f\"",
      "Harry nodded. \"I still don't know whether the Headmaster was\njoking or... the thing is, he was right in a way. I\nhad loving parents, but I never felt like I could trust\ntheir decisions, they weren't sane enough. I always knew\nthat if I didn't think things through myself, I might get hurt.\nProfessor McGonagall will do whatever it takes to get the job done\nif I'm there to nag her about it, she doesn't break rules\non her own without heroic supervision. Professor Quirrell really\nis someone who gets things done no matter what, and he's\nthe only other person I know who notices stuff like the Snitch\nruining Quidditch. But him I can't trust to be\ngood. Even if it's sad, I think that's part of the\nenvironment that creates what Dumbledore calls a hero - people who\ndon't have anyone else to shove final responsibility onto, and\nthat's why they form the mental habit of tracking everything\nthemselves.\"",
      "Hermione didn't say anything to that, but she was thinking back\nto something Godric Gryffindor had written near the end of his very\nshort autobiography. Briefly and without any explanation, because\nthe scroll had been meant to be copied by hand, centuries before\nthe Muggle printing press had inspired wizards to invent the\nReading-Writing Quill.",
      "No rescuer hath the rescuer, Godric Gryffindor had\nwritten. No Lord hath the champion, no mother and no father,\nonly nothingness above.",
      "If that was the price of being a hero, Hermione wasn't\nsure she wanted to pay it. Or maybe - though it wasn't the sort of\nthing she would have thought, before she started hanging around\nHarry - maybe Godric Gryffindor had gotten it wrong.",
      "\"Do you trust Dumbledore?\" Hermione said. \"I mean, he's\nright here in our school and he's the most legendary hero in the\nwhole world -\"",
      "\"He was the most legendary hero,\" said Harry. \"Now he\nsets chickens on fire. Honestly, does Dumbledore seem reliable to\nyou?\u202f\"",
      "Hermione didn't answer.",
      "Side by side, the two of them began to climb huge wide spiral\nstairs, the steps alternating between bronze metal and blue stone;\nthe final approach to where the Ravenclaw portrait waited to guard\ntheir dorm with silly riddles.",
      "\"Oh, and I just thought of something I should tell you,\" Harry\nsaid when they were about halfway up. \"Since it affects your life\nand all. Think of it as a sort of down payment -\"",
      "\"What is it?\" said Hermione.",
      "\"I predict S.P.H.E.W. is about to retire.\"",
      "\"Retire?\u202f\" Hermione said, almost stumbling on one of\nthe stairs.",
      "\"Yeah,\" Harry said. \"I mean, I could be wrong, but I suspect the\nteachers are about to clamp down hard on fighting in the\ncorridors.\" Harry was grinning as he spoke, a glint in his eyes\nbehind the glasses hinting at secret knowledge. \"Cast new wards to\ndetect offensive hexes, or start verifying reports of bullying\nusing Veritaserum - I can think of several ways they might shut it\ndown. But if I'm right, it's something to celebrate, Hermione, you\nand all of you. You kicked up enough public ruckus that you got\nthem to actually do something about the bullying.\nAll the bullying.\"",
      "Slowly, then, a smile began to creep up her lips, and as she\nreached the top of the stairs and began walking toward the\nRavenclaw portrait for her riddle, Hermione felt rather lighter on\nher feet, a wonderful lifting feeling spreading through her like\nshe'd been pumped full of helium.",
      "Somehow, despite all the effort the eight of them had put in,\nshe hadn't expected that much, she hadn't expected it to\nactually work.",
      "They'd made a difference...",
      "It was the end of breakfast-time on the next morning.",
      "The students from every year sat very still in their benches,\nall heads turned in the same direction, toward the Head Table,\nbefore which one lone first-year girl stood rigid and motionless,\nher head tilted back to stare up at the Head of House\nSlytherin.",
      "Professor Snape's face was twisted with fury and triumph,\nvindictive as any painting of a Dark Wizard; and behind him the\nother Professors sat at the Head Table, watching with faces as\nthough carved from stone.",
      "\"- permanently disbanded,\" spat the Potions Master. \"Your\nself-proclaimed Society is outlawed within Hogwarts, by my\ndecision as a Professor! If your Society or any member of it is\ndiscovered fighting in the hallways again, Granger, you will be\npersonally held responsible and expelled, by me, from the\nHogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!\"",
      "That first-year girl stood there, before the Head Table where\nshe'd been called before only to receive commendations and smiles;\nstood there with her spine held tall and upright in its curve like\na centaur's bow, giving nothing to the enemy.",
      "That first-year witch stood there with all tears and anger\nbottled, her face still, nothing changing of her outward\nappearance, while something slowly broke inside her, she could feel\nit breaking.",
      "It broke further when Professor Snape gave her two weeks\ndetention for the crime of violence in school, sneering with the\ncontemptuous face he'd shown them all on the first day of Potions,\nand with a little twist in the corner of his smile that said the\nPotions Master knew exactly how unfair he was being.",
      "Whatever-it-was inside her cracked all the way through, from top\nto bottom, when Professor Snape took one hundred points from\nRavenclaw.",
      "It ended, then, and Snape told her she was dismissed.",
      "She turned around and saw that at the Ravenclaw table, Harry\nPotter was sitting still in his place, she couldn't see his\nexpression from here, she saw his fists on the table but she\ncouldn't see if they were clenched white like her own. She had\nwhispered to him, when Professor Snape had called her, that he\nwasn't to do anything without asking first.",
      "Hermione wheeled back again to look at the Head Table, just as\nSnape was turning away from her to resume his place.",
      "\"I said you're dismissed, girl,\" said the sneering voice, but\nthere was a pleased smile on Snape's face, like he was waiting for\nher to do something -",
      "Hermione strode forward another five steps toward the Head Table\nand said in a breaking voice, \"Headmaster?\"",
      "Utter silence filled the Great Hall.",
      "Headmaster Dumbledore said nothing, didn't move. It was as\nthough he, too, was just carved from stone.",
      "Hermione turned her gaze to look at Professor Flitwick, whose\nhead, barely visible above the table, seemed to be staring down\ninto his lap. Beside him, Professor Sprout's face was very tight,\nshe seemed to be forcing herself to watch, and her lips were\ntrembling, but she said nothing.",
      "Professor McGonagall's chair was empty, the Deputy Headmistress\nhadn't shown up to breakfast that morning.",
      "\"Why aren't any of you saying anything?\" said Hermione Granger.\nHer voice was trembling with the last of her hope, the last\ndesperate reach for help from that place inside her. \"You\nknow what he's doing is wrong!\"",
      "\"Two more weeks' detention, for insolence,\" Snape said\nsilkily.",
      "It shattered.",
      "She looked at the Head Table for a few seconds longer, at\nProfessor Flitwick and Professor Sprout and the empty place where\nProfessor McGonagall should've been. Then Hermione Granger turned\nand began walking toward the Ravenclaw table.",
      "There was a babble of voices starting up, as the students came\nunfrozen from where they'd sat.",
      "And then, as she was almost to the Ravenclaw table -",
      "The dry voice of Professor Quirrell cut through everything, and\nthat voice said, \"One hundred points to Miss Granger for doing what\nis right.\"",
      "Hermione almost fell over her own feet; and then she continued\nforward, even as Snape shouted something furious, even as Professor\nQuirrell leaned back in his chair and began to laugh, even as\nDumbledore's voice was saying something she didn't catch and then\nshe was sitting down at the Ravenclaw table again next to Harry\nPotter.",
      "Harry Potter was frozen beside her, he looked like someone who\ndidn't dare move.",
      "\"It's all right,\" her voice said to him, automatically without\nthere being any choice or thought involved, although really it\nwasn't right at all. \"But can you see if you can get me out of\nSnape's detentions, like you did yourself that time?\"",
      "Harry Potter nodded, a single jerky motion of his head. \"I -\"\nsaid Harry. \"I - I'm sorry, this - this is all my fault -\"",
      "\"Don't be ridiculous, Harry.\" It was odd how her voice\nwas coming out all normal, and without her thinking about what to\nsay. Hermione looked down at her breakfast plate, but eating seemed\nto be clearly out of the question, there was a roiling and churning\nin her stomach which suggested that she was already on the verge of\nthrowing up, which was odd because she could have sworn her whole\nbody felt numb, like she wasn't feeling anything, at the same\ntime.",
      "\"And,\" her voice said, \"if you want to break school rules or\nsomething, you can ask me about it, I promise I won't just say\nno.\"",

      "Rianne Felthorne descended the stairs of roughened stone and\ncrude mortar, keeping a Lumos lit through the distances\nbetween fire-sconces, holding aloft her wand through the gaps from\nlight to light.",
      "She came to the empty rock cavern pierced by many dark openings,\nlit by a torch of ancient style that fired as she entered.",
      "There was no one else there, as yet, and after long minutes of\nnervous standing, she began the spell to Transfigure a cushioned\nsofa large enough for two people to sit, or maybe even lie down on.\nA simple wooden stool would have been easier, she could have done\nthat in fifteen seconds, but - well -",
      "Even when the sofa was fully conjured, Professor Snape still\nhadn't arrived, and she sat down on the left side of her sofa with\nher pulse hammering in her throat. Somehow she was only becoming\nmore nervous, not less, as the delay stretched.",
      "She knew this was the last time.",
      "The last time before all these memories went away, and Rianne\nFelthorne found herself in a mysterious cavern, wondering what was\ngoing on.",
      "There was something about it that felt like dying.",
      "The books said a properly done Obliviation wasn't harmful,\npeople forgot things all the time. People dreamed, and then woke up\nwithout remembering their dreams. Obliviation didn't even involve\nthat much discontinuity, just a brief instant of disorientation; it\nwas like being distracted by a loud noise and losing track of a\nthought you couldn't seem to remember afterward. That was what the\nbooks said, and why Memory Charms were fully approved by the\nMinistry for all authorized governmental purposes.",
      "But still, these thoughts, the thoughts she was\nthinking right now; soon nobody would have them anymore. When she\nlooked ahead in the future, there was nobody to complete the\nthoughts she wasn't finished thinking. Even if she managed to tie\nup all the loose ends in her mind over the next minute, there\nwouldn't be anything left of it afterward. Wasn't that exactly what\nyou would find yourself reflecting on, if you were going to die in\nthe next minute?",
      "There came the sound of muffled steps...",
      "Severus Snape emerged into the cavern.",
      "His eyes moved to her sitting on the sofa, and a strange\nexpression crossed his face; strange because it wasn't sardonic, or\nangry, or cold.",
      "\"Thank you, Miss Felthorne,\" Snape said quietly, \"that was\nconsiderate of you.\" The Potions Master took out his wand and\nperformed the usual privacy Charms, and then he moved toward her,\nand sat down heavily beside her on the Transfigured sofa.",
      "Her pulse was now pounding for another reason entirely.",
      "She slowly turned to look at Professor Snape, and saw that his\nhead was leaning back against the sofa, and his eyes were closed.\nNot sleeping, though. His face appeared tense, unrelaxed, bearing\npain.",
      "She knew - she was suddenly certain - that she was only allowed\nto see this sight because she wouldn't remember it afterward; and\nthat nobody before her had ever been allowed to see it.",
      "The frantic conversation going on inside Rianne Felthorne's mind\nsounded something like this: I could just lean over and kiss\nhim, you are completely out of your tiny mind, his eyes are closed\nI bet he wouldn't stop me in time, I bet it would be years before\nanyone found your body -",
      "But Professor Snape opened his eyes then (to her inner\ndisappointment and relief), and said, in a more normal voice, \"Your\npayment, Miss Felthorne.\" From his robe he took a ruby, cut to\nGringotts standard, and held it out toward her. \"Fifty facets. I\nwill not mind if you count them.\"",
      "She held out a trembling hand, hoping that Snape would press the\nruby into her fingers, that she would feel a touch of his skin\nalive against hers -",
      "But instead Snape raised his hand slightly and dropped the ruby\ninto her hand, then leaned back against the couch. \"You will\nremember finding it lying on the ground of this cavern, where you\ncame exploring,\" said Snape. \"And since nobody except you will\nactually believe that, you will remember thinking that it would be\nless troublesome if you deposited the money into a separate box in\nGringotts.\"",
      "For a stretch there was only the faint crackling of the\ntorch.",
      "\"Why -\" Rianne Felthorne said. He knows I won't\nremember. \"Why did you do it? I mean - you said to\ntell you where bullies would be, and who they would be, but not\nwhether Granger would be there. And I know, the way the Time-Turner\nworks, if you want to make Granger be there, you can't be\ntold whether it's already happened. So I did work out that\nwe were the ones telling her where to go. We were, weren't\nwe?\"",
      "Snape nodded without speaking. He had closed his eyes again.",
      "\"But,\" said Rianne, \"I didn't understand why you were\nhelping her. And now - after what you did to Granger in the Great\nHall - I just don't understand at all.\" Rianne had never thought of\nherself as particularly nice. She'd taken little notice of the\ncontroversy over the Sunshine General. But something about\nhelping Granger fight bullies had... well, she'd gotten\nused to thinking of that as the good side, and thinking of\nherself as being on the good side. And she'd found she\nactually liked it. It was hard, to just let that go. \"Why'd you do\nthat, Professor Snape?\"",
      "Snape shook his head, his face tightened.",
      "\"Is -\" Rianne said falteringly. \"I mean - so long as we're here\n- is there anything you do want to talk about?\" There was something\nshe wanted to say, but she couldn't make the words pass\nher own lips.",
      "\"I can think of one matter,\" Snape said after a pause. \"If you\nare interested, Miss Felthorne.\"",
      "Snape's eyes were still shut, so she couldn't just nod her head.\nHer voice almost broke, when she forced herself to say \"Yes.\"",
      "\"There's a certain boy in your class who likes you, Miss\nFelthorne,\" Snape said from behind his closed eyes. \"I won't say\nhis name. But he watches you every time you walk across the room,\nwhen he thinks you aren't looking. He dreams about you and desires\nto possess you, but he's never asked you for so much as a\nkiss.\"",
      "Her heart started hammering even harder.",
      "\"Please tell me the honest truth, Miss Felthorne. What do you\nthink of that boy?\"",
      "\"Well -\" she said. She was stumbling over her words. \"I think -\nto never even ask for one kiss - would be -\"",
      "Sad.",
      "Just too pitiful.",
      "\"Weakness,\" she said, her voice trembling.",
      "\"I agree,\" said Snape. \"Suppose that boy had helped you, though.\nWould you think that you owed him a kiss, if he asked?\"",
      "She inhaled sharply -",
      "\"Or would you think,\" Snape continued, his eyes still closed,\n\"that he was just being bothersome?\"",
      "The words stabbed into her like a knife and she couldn't help\ngasping out loud.",
      "Snape's eyes flew open, and his gaze met hers across the\nsofa.",
      "Then the Potions Master began to laugh, small sad chuckles.",
      "\"No, not you, Miss Felthorne!\" Snape said. \"Not\nyou! We really are talking about a boy. One who\nattends your Potions class, in fact.\"",
      "\"Oh,\" she said. She tried to remember what Snape had said\nbefore, now feeling rather unnerved as she thought of some boy\nwatching her, always silently watching. \"Well, um, in that case.\nThat's kind of creepy, actually. Who is it?\"",
      "The Potions Master shook his head. \"It doesn't matter,\" said\nSnape. \"Out of curiosity, what would you think if that boy were\nstill in love with you years later?\"",
      "\"Um,\" she said, feeling a bit confused, \"that would be totally\npathetic?\"",
      "The torch crackled a bit in the cavern.",
      "\"It's strange,\" Snape said quietly. \"I have had two mentors,\nover the course of my days. Both were extraordinarily perceptive,\nand neither one ever told me the things I wasn't seeing. It's clear\nenough why the first said nothing, but the second...\" Snape's face\ntightened. \"I suppose I would have to be naive, to ask why he\nstayed silent.\"",
      "The quiet stretched, while Rianne tried frantically to think of\nsomething to say.",
      "\"It is an odd thing,\" Snape said, his voice still softer, \"to\nlook back after only thirty-two years, and wonder when your life\nwas ruined past all rescuing. Was it determined when the Sorting\nHat cried 'Slytherin!' for me? It seems unfair, since I was offered\nno choice; the Sorting Hat spoke the moment it touched upon my\nhead. Yet I cannot claim it named me untruly. I never treasured\nknowledge for its own sake. I was not loyal to the one person I\ncalled friend. I was never one for righteous fury, then or now.\nCourage? There is no bravery in risking a life already ruined. My\nlittle fears have always mastered me, and I never turned aside from\nany of the paths I walked down, for those little fears. No, the\nSorting Hat could never have put me in her House. Perhaps my final\nloss was determined, even then. Is that fair, I ask, even if the\nSorting Hat speaks truly? Is it fair that some children should\npossess more courage than others, and thus a man's life be\njudged?\"",
      "Rianne Felthorne was starting to realize that she'd never had\nthe tiniest inkling of who her Potions Master was inside, and\nunfortunately all these dark hidden depths weren't helping her with\nher problem.",
      "\"But no,\" Snape said. \"I know where it went wrong for the last\ntime. I could point to the very day and hour I missed my final\nchance. Miss Felthorne, did the Sorting Hat offer you\nRavenclaw?\"",
      "\"Y-yes,\" she said without thinking.",
      "\"Have you ever been any good at riddles?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" she said again, because whatever Professor Snape was\nabout to say, she wouldn't hear it if she said no.",
      "\"I am terrible at riddles,\" Snape said in a distant voice. \"I\nwas once given a riddle to solve, and I did not understand even the\nsimplest part until too late. I did not even realize the riddle was\nmeant for me until too late. I thought I had merely\nhappened to overhear it, when in truth it was I who was overheard.\nSo I sold my riddle to another, and that is when the wreckage of my\nlife passed beyond retrieval.\" Snape's voice was still distant,\nsounding more abstracted than sorrowful. \"And even now, I\nunderstand nothing of importance. Tell me, Miss Felthorne, suppose\na man were carrying a knife, and he tripped over a baby and stabbed\nhimself. Would you say that the baby had,\" Snape's voice lowered,\nas though he were imitating some still deeper voice, \"THE POWER\nTO VANQUISH him?\"",
      "\"Um... no?\" she said hesitantly.",
      "\"Then what does it mean to have the power to vanquish\nsomeone?\"",
      "Rianne considered the puzzle. (Wishing, not for the first time\nin her life, that she had chosen Ravenclaw and to perdition with\nher parents' disapproval; but the Sorting Hat had never offered her\nGryffindor.) \"Well...\" Rianne said. She was having trouble putting\nher thoughts into words. \"It means you've got the power,\nbut you don't have to do it. It means you could do it if\nyou tried -\"",
      "\"Choice,\" the Potions Master said in the same faraway voice, as\nthough he wasn't really talking to her at all. \"There will be a\nchoice. That is what the riddle seems to imply. And that choice is\nnot a foregone conclusion to the chooser, for the riddle does not\nsay, will vanquish, but rather the power to\nvanquish. How would a grown man mark a baby as his equal?\"",
      "\"What?\" said Rianne. She didn't understand that at all.",
      "\"Marking a baby is simple. Any strong Dark curse would\nproduce a lasting scar. But such may be done to any child. What\nmark would signify that a baby was your equal?\u202f\"",
      "She answered with the first thought that came to mind. \"If you\nsigned a betrothal contract, that would mean you'd be equals with\nthem someday, when they grew up and you got married.\"",
      "\"That...\" said Snape. \"That's probably not it, Miss Felthorne,\nbut thank you for trying.\" The long delicate fingers, honed by\nstirring potions to unimaginably fine tolerances, reached up and\nrubbed at the temples of the man's forehead. \"It is enough to drive\nme to madness, so much hinging on such fragile words. Power he\nknows not... it must be more than some unknown spell. Not\nsomething he could acquire simply by practice and study.\nSome innate talent? No one can learn to be a Metamorphmagus... and\nyet that hardly seems like a power he knows not. Nor can I\nsee how either could destroy all but a remnant of the\nother; I can see it in one direction, but not the reverse...\" The\nPotions Master sighed. \"And none of this means anything to you,\ndoes it, Miss Felthorne? The words are nothing. The words are\nshadows. It is her intonation which carries the meaning\nand that is something I've never been able to...\"",
      "The Potions Master trailed off, while Rianne stared at him.",
      "\"A prophecy?\u202f\" Rianne said in a high squeak. \"You heard\na prophecy?\u202f\" She'd taken Divination for a couple of\nmonths before dropping it in disgust, and she knew that much about\nhow it worked.",
      "\"I will try one last thing,\" said Snape. \"Something I have not\ntried before. Miss Felthorne, listen to the sound of my\nvoice, the way I say it, not the words\nthemselves, and tell me what you think it means. Can you do that?\nGood,\" said Snape, as she nodded obediently, though she wasn't sure\nat all what she was supposed to do.",
      "And Severus Snape drew a breath, and intoned, \"FOR THOSE TWO\nDIFFERENT SPELLETS CANNOT EXIST IN THE SAME VULD.\"",
      "It sent shivers down her spine, all the worse for knowing the\nhollow words had been spoken in imitation of a true prophecy.\nUnnerved, she blurted out the first thing which came to mind, which\nmight have been influenced by her present company. \"Those two\ndifferent ingredients cannot exist in the same cauldron?\"",
      "\"But why not, Miss Felthorne? What is the\nmeaning of a statement like that? What are we really being\ntold?\"",
      "\"Ah...\" she hazarded. \"If the two ingredients mix, they'll catch\nfire and burn the cauldron?\"",
      "Snape's face did not change expression in the slightest.",
      "\"Perhaps,\" Snape finally said, after they'd sat on the sofa in\nawful silence for what seemed like minutes. \"It would explain the\nword must. Thank you, Miss Felthorne. Once again you have\nbeen most helpful.\"",
      "\"I -\" she said, \"I was glad to -\" and the words stuck in her\nthroat. The Potions Master had thanked her with a tone of finality,\nand she knew that the time of the Rianne Felthorne who remembered\nthese moments was drawing to an end. \"I wish I didn't have to\nforget this, Professor Snape!\"",
      "\"I wish,\" Severus Snape said in a whisper so low she could\nhardly hear it, \"that everything had been different...\"",
      "The Potions Master stood up from the sofa, the weight of his\npresence vanishing from beside her. He turned and drew his wand\nfrom his robes, pointing it at her.",
      "\"Wait -\" she said. \"Before that -\"",
      "Somehow it was unbelievably hard to take the first step from\nfantasy to reality, from imagining to doing. Even if it was only\none step and would never go any further. The gap stretched like the\ndistance between two mountains.",
      "The Sorting Hat had never offered her Gryffindor...",
      "...was it fair that thus a woman's life be judged?",
      "If you can't say it now, when you won't even\nremember it afterward - when nothing will continue from this\nmoment, just as if you were to die - then when will you ever say\nit, to anyone?",
      "\"Can I have a kiss first?\" said Rianne Felthorne.",
      "Snape's black eyes studied her so intensely that her blush\nstarted to reach all the way to her chest, and she wondered if he\nknew perfectly well that she was still being weak, and it wasn't a\nkiss she'd truly wanted.",
      "\"Why not,\" the Potions Master said quietly, and he leaned his\nhead down over the sofa and kissed her.",
      "It was nothing like she'd imagined. In her fantasies Snape's\nkisses were fierce, seized from her, but this was - it was just\nawkward, actually. Snape's lips pressed down too hard on\nhers, forcing them back against her teeth, and the angle wasn't\nright and their noses were sort of bending and his lips were too\ntight and -",
      "Only as the Potions Master straightened back up again, raising\nhis wand once more, did she realize.",
      "\"That wasn't -\" she said in a wondering voice, looking up at\nhim. \"That wasn't - was it - your first -\"",
      "Rianne Felthorne blinked at the stone cavern she'd discovered,\nstill holding the extraordinary ruby she'd found embedded in the\ndirt of one corner. It was an incredible windfall, and she didn't\nknow why looking at the ruby made her feel so sad, like she'd\nforgotten something, something that had been precious to her."

      "Aftermath: Albus Dumbledore and -",
      "The old wizard sat alone at his desk, in the unsilence of the\nHeadmaster's office, amid the innumerable and unnoticed devices;\nhis robes a gentle yellow, of soft fabric, not such clothing as he\nordinarily wore before others. His wrinkled hand held a quill\nscratching away at an official-looking parchment. If you had\nsomehow been there to watch his lined face, you would have been\nunable to deduce anything more about the man himself than you\nunderstood of the enigmatic devices. You might have observed that\nthe face looked a little sad, a little tired, but then Albus\nDumbledore always looked like that when he was alone.",
      "In the Floo hearth there were only scattered ashes without a\nhint of flame, a magical door that had been shut so solidly as to\nstop existing. On the material plane, the great oaken door to the\noffice had been closed and locked; beyond that door, the Endless\nStairs stayed motionless; at the bottom of those stairs, the\ngargoyles that blocked the entrance did not flow, their pseudo-life\nwithdrawn to leave solid rock.",
      "Then, even as the quill was in the middle of penning a word,\neven as it was in the middle of scratching a letter -",
      "The old wizard shot to his feet with a speed that would have\nshocked anyone watching, abandoning the quill in mid-letter to fall\nonto the parchment; like lightning he spun on the oaken door, his\nyellow robes whirling around him and a wand of dread power leaping\ninto his hand -",
      "And as abruptly, the old wizard paused, halting his motion even\nas the wand came to bear.",
      "A hand struck upon the oaken door, three times knocking.",
      "More slowly, now, that grim wand went back into the dueling\nholster strapped beneath the old wizard's sleeve. The ancient man\nmoved forward a few paces, drew himself up into a more formal\nstance, composed his face. Nearby upon the desk, the quill moved to\nthe side of the parchment, as though it had been carefully placed\nthere rather than dropped in haste; and the parchment itself\nflipped over to show blankness.",
      "With a silent twitch of his will, the oaken door swung open.",
      "Hard as stones, the green eyes glared at him.",
      "\"I admit that I am impressed, Harry,\" the old wizard said\nquietly. \"The Cloak of Invisibility would have let you evade my\nlesser means of vision; but I did not sense my golems step aside,\nnor the stairs turning. How did you come here?\"",
      "The boy walked into the office, step by deliberate step until\nthe door closed smoothly behind him. \"I can go anywhere I choose,\nwith or without permission,\" that boy said. His voice seemed calm;\ntoo calm, perhaps. \"I am in your office because I decided to be\nhere, and to hell with passwords. You are greatly mistaken,\nHeadmaster Dumbledore, if you think that I stay in this school\nbecause I am a prisoner here. I simply have not chosen,\nyet, to leave. Now keeping that in mind, why did you\ncommand your agent, Professor Snape, to break the agreement we made\nin this office, that he would not torment any student in her fourth\nyear or below?\"",
      "The old wizard looked at the angry young hero for a long moment.\nThen, slowly enough not to alarm the boy, those wizened fingers\ndrew open one of the manifold drawers of the desk, lifted out a\nsheet of parchment, laid it upon the desk. \"Fourteen,\" the old\nwizard said. \"It is not the number of all the owls sent last night.\nOnly the owls sent to families with a seat on the Wizengamot, or\nfamilies of great wealth, or families already allied with your\nfoes. Or, in the case of Robert Jugson, all three; for his father,\nLord Jugson, is a Death Eater, and his grandfather a Death Eater\nwho died by Alastor Moody's wand. What the letters said, I do not\nknow, but I can guess. Do you still not understand, Harry\nPotter? Each time Hermione Granger won, as you put it, the\ndanger to her from Slytherin grew again, and yet again. But now the\nSlytherins have triumphed over her, easily and safely, without\nviolence or lasting harm. They have won, and need fight no more...\"\nThe old wizard sighed. \"So I had planned. So I had hoped. So it\nwould have been, if the Defense Professor had not taken it upon\nhimself to intervene. Now the dispute goes to the Board of\nGovernors, where Severus will seem to conquer the Defense\nProfessor; but that will not feel the same to the Slytherins, it\nwill not have been over and finished in a moment, to their\nsatisfaction.\"",
      "The boy advanced further into the room, his head tilting back\nfurther to look up at the half-moon glasses; and somehow it was\nlike the boy was looking down at the Headmaster, rather than up.\n\"So this Lord Jugson is a Death Eater?\" the boy said softly. \"Good.\nHis life is already bought and paid for, then, and I can do\nanything I want to him without ethical problems -\"",
      "\"Harry!\u202f\"",
      "The boy's voice was clear as ice, frozen of purest water from\nsome untouched spring. \"You seem to think that the Light should\nlive in fear of the darkness. I say it should be the other way\naround. I'd prefer not to kill this Lord Jugson, even if he is a\nDeath Eater. But one hour of brainstorming with the Defense\nProfessor would be plenty of time to come up with some creative way\nto wreck him financially, or get him exiled from magical Britain.\nThat would serve to make the point, I think.\"",
      "\"I confess,\" the old wizard said slowly, \"that the thought of\nruining a five-hundred-year-old House, and challenging a Death\nEater to war to the finish, over a scuffle in a Hogwarts hallway,\nhad not occurred to me, Harry.\" The old wizard lifted a finger to\npush back his half-moon glasses from where they had slid a little\ndown his nose, during his sudden motion earlier. \"I daresay it\nwould not occur to Miss Granger either, nor to Professor\nMcGonagall, nor to Fred and George.\"",
      "The boy shrugged. \"It wouldn't be about the hallways,\"\nthe boy said. \"It would be justice for his past crimes, and I'd\nonly do it if Jugson made the first move. The point isn't to make\npeople scared of me as a wild card, after all. It's to teach them\nthat neutrals are perfectly safe from me, and poking me with a\nstick is incredibly dangerous.\" The boy smiled in a way that didn't\nreach his eyes. \"Maybe I'll buy an ad in the Daily Prophet, saying\nthat anyone who wants to carry on this dispute with me will learn\nthe true meaning of Chaos, but anyone who leaves me alone will be\nfine.\"",
      "\"No,\" the old wizard said. His voice was deeper now,\nshowing something of his true age and power. \"No, Harry, that must\nnot be. You have not yet learned the meaning of fighting, what\ntruly happens when foes meet in battle. And so you dream, as young\nboys do, of teaching your foes to fear you. It frightens me that\nyou, at far too young an age, might already have enough power to\nmake some part of your dreams into reality. There is no\nturning of that road which does not lead into darkness, Harry,\nnone. That is the way of a Dark Lord, for certain.\"",
      "The boy hesitated, then, and his eyes flickered to the empty\ngolden platform where Fawkes sometimes rested his wings. It was a\ngesture that few would have caught, but the old wizard knew it very\nwell.",
      "\"All right, forget the part about teaching them to fear me,\" the\nboy said then. His voice was no less hard, but some of the cold had\ngone from it. \"I still don't think you should let children get hurt\nout of fear of what someone like Lord Jugson might do.\nProtecting them is the whole point of your job. If Lord Jugson\nreally does try to get in your way, then do whatever it takes to\nstop him. Give me full access to my vaults, and I'll take\npersonal responsibility for dealing with any fallout from banning\nbullies in Hogwarts, whether it's Lord Jugson or anyone else.\"",
      "Slowly the old wizard shook his head. \"You seem to think, Harry,\nthat I need merely use my full power, and all foes will be swept\naside. You are wrong. Lucius Malfoy controls Minister Fudge,\nthrough the Daily Prophet he sways all Britain, only by\nbare margins does he not control enough of the Board of Governors\nto oust me from Hogwarts. Amelia Bones and Bartemius Crouch are\nallies, but even they would step aside if they saw us acting\nwantonly. The world that surrounds you is more fragile than you\nseem to believe, and we must walk with greater care. The old\nWizarding War never ended, Harry, it only continued in a different\nform; the black king slept, and Lucius Malfoy moved his chesspieces\nfor a time. Do you think Lucius Malfoy would lightly permit you to\ntake a pawn of his color?\"",
      "The boy smiled, now with a touch of coldness again. \"Okay, I'll\nfigure out some way to set it up so that it looks like Lord Jugson\nbetrayed his own side.\"",
      "\"Harry -\"",
      "\"Obstacles mean you get creative, Headmaster. It\ndoesn't mean you abandon the children you're supposed to protect.\nLet the Light win, and if trouble comes of it -\" The boy shrugged.\n\"Let Light win again.\"",
      "\"So might phoenixes speak, if they had words,\" the old wizard\nsaid. \"But you do not understand the phoenix's price.\"",
      "The last two words were spoken in a peculiarly clear voice that\nseemed to echo around the office, and then a huge rumbling noise\nseemed to come from all around them.",
      "Between the ancient shield on the wall and the Sorting Hat's\nhatrack, the stone of the walls began to flow and move, pouring\nitself into two framing columns and revealing a gap between them,\nan opening that showed a set of stone stairs leading upward into\ndarkness.",
      "The old wizard turned and strode toward those stairs, and then\nlooked back at where Harry Potter stood. \"Come!\" said the old\nwizard. There was no twinkle now in those blue eyes. \"Since you\nhave already gone so far as to force your way here uninvited, you\nmay as well go further.\"",
      "There were no railings on those stone steps, and after the first\nfew steps Harry drew his wand and cast Lumos. The\nHeadmaster did not look back, did not seem to be looking downward,\nas though he had climbed the steps often enough to have no need of\nvision.",
      "The boy knew that he should have been curious, or frightened,\nbut there was no spare brain capacity for that. It was taking all\nhis control not to let the fury simmering inside him boil over any\nfurther than it already had.",
      "The stairs went on for only a short distance, one straight\nrising flight without turns or curves.",
      "At the top was a door of solid metal, looking black in the blue\nlight cast from Harry's wand, meaning that the metal itself was\neither black or perhaps red.",
      "Albus Dumbledore lifted up his long wand like a brandished\nsymbol, and again spoke in that strange voice which seemed to echo\nin Harry's ears, as though burning itself into his memory:\n\"Phoenix's fate.\"",
      "That last door opened, and Harry followed Dumbledore inside.",
      "The room beyond seemed to be made of black metal like the door\nthat led to it. The walls were black, the floor was black. The\nceiling above was black, but for a single globe of crystal that\nhung down from the ceiling on a white chain, and shone with a\nbrilliant silver light that looked like it had been cast in\nimitation of Patronus light, though you could tell it wasn't the\nreal thing.",
      "Within the room were pedestals of black metal, each bearing a\nmoving picture, or an upright cylinder half-filled with some\nfaintly shining silver liquid, or a lone small object; a scorched\nsilver necklace, a crushed hat, an untouched golden wedding ring.\nMany pedestals bore all three, the moving picture and the silver\nliquid and the item. There seemed to be a good many wizards' wands\nupon those pedestals, and many of those wands were broken, or\nburned, or looked like the wood had somehow melted.",
      "It took that long for Harry to realize what he was seeing, and\nthen his throat suddenly choked; it was like the rage inside him\nhad been hit a hammerblow, maybe the hardest hammerblow of his\nentire existence.",
      "\"These are not all the fallen of all my wars,\" Albus Dumbledore\nsaid. His back was to Harry, only his grey locks and yellowish\nrobes showed. \"Not even nearly all of them. Only my closest\nfriends, and those who died of my worst decisions, there is\nsomething of them here. Those I regret most of all, this is their\nplace.\"",
      "Harry couldn't count how many pedestals were in the room. It\nmight have been around a hundred. The room of black metal was not\nsmall, and there was clearly more space left in it for future\npedestals.",
      "Albus Dumbledore turned and regarded Harry, the deep blue eyes\nset like steel in his brow, but his voice, when he spoke, was calm.\n\"It seems to me that you know nothing of the phoenix's price,\"\nAlbus Dumbledore said quietly. \"It seems to me that you are not an\nevil person, but most terribly ignorant, and confident in your\nignorance; as I once was, a long time ago. Yet I have never heard\nFawkes so clearly as you seemed to, that day. Perhaps I was already\ntoo old and full of grief, when my phoenix came to me. If there is\nsomething I do not understand, about how ready I should be to\nfight, then tell me of this wisdom.\" There was no anger in the old\nwizard's voice; the impact that drove out your breath like falling\noff a broomstick was all in the scorched and shattered wands,\ngleaming gently in their death beneath the silver light. \"Or else\nturn and go from this place, but then I wish to hear no more of\nit.\"",
      "Harry didn't know what to say. There had been nothing in his own\nlife that was like this, and all the words seemed to fall away. He\nwould find something to say if he looked, but he couldn't believe,\nin that moment, that the words would be meaningful. You shouldn't\nbe able to win any possible argument, just from people having died\nof your decisions, and yet even knowing that it felt like there was\nnothing to be said. That there was nothing Harry had any right to\nsay.",
      "And Harry almost did turn and go from that place, except for the\nunderstanding which came to him then: that there was probably a\npart of Albus Dumbledore which always stood in this place, always,\nno matter where he was. And that if you stood in a place like this\nyou could do anything, lose anything, if it meant that you\ndidn't have to fight another time.",
      "One of the pedestals caught Harry's eye; the photograph on it\ndid not move, did not smile or wave, it was a Muggle photograph of\na woman looking seriously at the camera, her brown hair twisted\ninto braids of an ordinary Muggle style that Harry hadn't seen on\nany witch. There was a cylinder of silvery liquid beside the\nphotograph, but no object; no melted ring or broken wand.",
      "Harry walked forward, slowly, until he stood before the\npedestal. \"Who was she?\" Harry said, his voice sounding strange in\nhis own ears.",
      "\"Her name was Tricia Glasswell,\" said Dumbledore. \"The mother of\na Muggleborn daughter, who the Death Eaters killed. She was a\ndetective of the Muggle government, and after that she fed\ninformation from the Muggle authorities to the Order of the\nPhoenix, until she was - betrayed - into the hands of Voldemort.\"\nThere was a catch in the old wizard's voice. \"She did not die well,\nHarry.\"",
      "\"Did she save lives?\" Harry said.",
      "\"Yes,\" the wizard said quietly. \"She did.\"",
      "Harry lifted his gaze from the pedestal to look at Dumbledore.\n\"Would the world be a better place if she hadn't fought?\"",
      "\"No, it would not,\" said the old wizard. His voice was tired,\nand grieving. He seemed more bent now, as though he were folding in\non himself. \"I see that you still do not understand. I think you\nwill not understand until the day that you - oh, Harry. So very\nlong ago, when I was not much older than you are now, I learned the\ntrue face of violence, and its cost. To fill the air with deadly\ncurses - for any reason - for any reason, Harry - it is an\nill thing, and its nature is corrupted, as terrible as the darkest\nrituals. Violence, once begun, becomes like a Lethifold that\nstrikes at any life near it. I... would spare you that lesson the\nway I learned it, Harry.\"",
      "Harry looked away from the blue eyes, cast his gaze down at the\nblack metal of the floor. The Headmaster was trying to tell him\nsomething important, that was clear; and it wasn't something that\nHarry thought was stupid, either.",
      "\"There was a Muggle once named Mohandas Gandhi,\" Harry said to\nthe floor. \"He thought the government of Muggle Britain shouldn't\nrule over his country. And he refused to fight. He convinced his\nwhole country not to fight. Instead he told his people to walk up\nto the British soldiers and let themselves be struck down, without\nresisting, and when Britain couldn't stand doing that any more, we\nfreed his country. I thought it was a very beautiful thing, when I\nread about it, I thought it was something higher than all the wars\nthat anyone had ever fought with guns or swords. That they'd really\ndone that, and that it had actually worked.\" Harry drew\nanother breath. \"Only then I found out that Gandhi told his people,\nduring World War II, that if the Nazis invaded they should use\nnonviolent resistance against them, too. But the Nazis would've\njust shot everyone in sight. And maybe Winston Churchill always\nfelt that there should've been a better way, some clever way to win\nwithout having to hurt anyone; but he never found it, and so he had\nto fight.\" Harry looked up at the Headmaster, who was staring at\nhim. \"Winston Churchill was the one who tried to convince the\nBritish government not to give Czechoslovakia to Hitler in\nexchange for a peace treaty, that they should fight right away\n-\"",
      "\"I recognize the name, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. The old wizard's\nlips twitched upward. \"Although honesty compels me to say that dear\nWinston was never one for pangs of conscience, even after a dozen\nshots of Firewhiskey.\"",
      "\"The point is,\" Harry said, after a brief pause to remember\nexactly who he was talking to, and fight down the suddenly\nreturning sense that he was an ignorant child gone insane with\naudacity who had no right to be in this room and no right to\nquestion Albus Dumbledore about anything, \"the point is, saying\nviolence is evil isn't an answer. It doesn't say when to\nfight and when not to fight. It's a hard question and Gandhi\nrefused to deal with it, and that's why I lost some of my respect\nfor him.\"",
      "\"And your own answer, Harry?\" Dumbledore said quietly.",
      "\"One answer is that you shouldn't ever use violence except to\nstop violence,\" Harry said. \"You shouldn't risk anyone's life\nexcept to save even more lives. It sounds good when you\nsay it like that. Only the problem is that if a police officer sees\na burglar robbing a house, the police officer should try\nto stop the burglar, even though the burglar might fight back and\nsomeone might get hurt or even killed. Even if the burglar is only\ntrying to steal jewelry, which is just a thing. Because if\nnobody so much as inconveniences burglars, there will be\nmore burglars, and more burglars. And even if\nthey only ever stole things each time, it would - the\nfabric of society -\" Harry stopped. His thoughts weren't as ordered\nas they usually pretended to be, in this room. He should have been\nable to give some perfectly logical exposition in terms of game\ntheory, should have at least been able to see it that way,\nbut it was eluding him. Hawks and doves - \"Don't you see, if evil\npeople are willing to risk violence to get what they want, and good\npeople always back down because violence is too terrible to risk,\nit's - it's not a good society to live in, Headmaster! Don't you\nrealize what all this bullying is doing to Hogwarts, to Slytherin\nHouse most of all?\"",
      "\"War is too terrible to risk,\" the old wizard said.\n\"And yet it will come. Voldemort is returning. The black\nchesspieces are gathering. Severus is one of the most important\npieces our own side possesses, in that war. But our evil Potions\nMaster must, as the saying goes, keep up appearances. If Severus\ncan pay that keep by hurting the feelings of children, only their\nfeelings, Harry,\" the old wizard's voice was very soft, \"you would\nhave to be most terribly innocent in the ways of war, to think he\nhad made a poor bargain. Hard decisions do not look like\nthat, Harry. They look - like this.\" The old wizard did\nnot gesture. He simply stood where he was, among the pedestals.",
      "\"You shouldn't be Headmaster,\" Harry said through the burning in\nhis throat. \"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, but you shouldn't try to be a\nschool principal and run a war at the same time. Hogwarts shouldn't\nbe part of this.\"",
      "\"The children will survive,\" the old wizard said with tired old\neyes. \"They would not survive Voldemort. Have you wondered why the\nchildren of Hogwarts do not speak much of their parents, Harry? It\nis because there is always, within earshot, someone who has lost\ntheir mother or father or both. That is what Voldemort left behind,\nthe last time he came. Nothing is worth that war beginning\nagain even one day earlier than it must, or lasting one day longer\nthan it must.\" The old wizard did gesture now, as though to\nindicate all the shattered wands. \"We did not fight because it\nseemed righteous to do so! We fought when we had to, when there was\nno other way left. That was our answer.\"",
      "\"Is that why you waited so long to confront Grindelwald?\"",
      "Harry had uttered the question without quite thinking -",
      "There was a slow time while the blue eyes searched him.",
      "\"Who have you been talking to, Harry?\" said the old wizard. \"No,\ndo not answer. I already know.\" Dumbledore sighed. \"Many have asked\nme that question, and always I have turned them aside. Yet in time\nyou must learn the full truth of that matter. Will you swear never\nto speak of it to another, until I give you leave?\"",
      "Harry would have liked to be allowed to tell Draco, but - \"I\nswear,\" Harry said.",
      "\"Grindelwald possessed an ancient and terrible device,\" said\nDumbledore. \"While he held it, I could not break his defense. In\nour duel I could not win, only fight him for long hours until he\nfell in exhaustion; and I would have died of it afterward, if not\nfor Fawkes. But while his Muggle allies yet made blood sacrifice to\nsustain him, Grindelwald would not have fallen. He was,\nduring that time, truly invincible. Of that grim device which\nGrindelwald held, none must know, none must suspect, there must be\nnot a single hint. And therefore you must not speak of it, and I\nwill say no more for now. That is all, Harry. There is no moral to\nit, and no wisdom. That is all there is.\"",
      "Harry slowly nodded. It wasn't entirely implausible, by the\nstandards of magic...",
      "\"And then,\" Dumbledore's voice went on, even quieter, almost as\nthough he were speaking to himself, \"since it was I who felled him,\nthey obeyed me when I said he should not die, though they cried by\nthe thousands for his blood. So he was imprisoned in Nurmengard, in\nthe prison that he built, and he abides there until this day. I\nwent to that duel without any intent to kill him, Harry. Because,\nyou see, I had tried to kill Grindelwald once before, a long time\nago, and that... that was... it proved to be... a mistake,\nHarry...\" The old wizard was staring now at his long dark-grey wand\nwhere he held it in both hands, as though it were a crystal ball\nout of Muggle fantasy, a scrying pool within which answers could be\nfound. \"And I thought, then... I thought that I should never kill.\nAnd then came Voldemort.\"",
      "The old wizard looked back up at Harry, and said, in a hoarse\nvoice, \"He is not like Grindelwald, Harry. There is nothing human\nleft in him. Him you must destroy. You must not hesitate,\nwhen the time comes. To him alone, of all the creatures in this\nworld, you must show no mercy; and when you are done you must\nforget it, forget that you ever did such a thing, and go back to\nliving. Save your fury for that, and that alone.\"",
      "In that office there was silence.",
      "It lasted for some many long seconds, and finally was broken by\na single question.",
      "\"Are there Dementors in Nurmengard?\"",
      "\"What?\" said the old wizard. \"No! I would not have done that\neven to him -\"",
      "The old wizard stared at the young boy, who had straightened,\nand his face changed.",
      "\"In other words,\" the boy said, as though talking to himself\nwithout any other people in the room, \"it's already known how to\nkeep powerful Dark Wizards in prison, without using Dementors.\nPeople know they know that.\"",
      "\"Harry...?\"",
      "\"No,\" the boy said. The boy looked up, and his eyes were blazing\nlike green fire. \"I do not accept your answer, Headmaster. Fawkes\ngave me a mission, and I know now why Fawkes gave that mission to\nme, and not to you. You are willing to accept balances of power\nwhere the bad guys end up winning. I am not.\"",
      "\"That too is not an answer,\" the old wizard said; his face\nshowed nothing of his hurt, he had long practice in concealing\npain. \"Refusing to accept something does not change it. I wonder\nnow if you are simply too young to understand this matter, Harry,\ndespite your outward airs; only in children's fantasies can all\nbattles be won, and not a single evil tolerated.\"",
      "\"And that's why I can destroy Dementors and you can't,\" said the\nboy. \"Because I believe that the darkness can be broken.\"",
      "The old wizard's breath stopped in his throat.",
      "\"The phoenix's price isn't inevitable,\" the boy said. \"It's not\npart of some deep balance built into the universe. It's just the\nparts of the problem where you haven't figured out yet how to\ncheat.\"",
      "The old wizard's lips parted, and no words came forth.",
      "Silver light falling on shattered wands.",
      "\"Fawkes gave me a mission,\" the boy repeated, \"and I will carry\nout that mission if I must break the entire Ministry to do it.\nThat's the part of the answer that you're missing. You don't stop\nand say, oh well, guess I can't possibly figure out any way to\nstop bullying in Hogwarts, and leave it at that. You\njust keep looking until you figure out how to do it. If that\nrequires breaking Lucius Malfoy's entire conspiracy,\nfine.\"",
      "\"And the true fight, the fight against Voldemort?\" the old\nwizard said in an unsteady voice. \"What will you do to win\nthat, Harry? Will you break the whole world? Even if\nsomeday you gain such power, you are not yet beyond prices, and\nperhaps you never will be! For you to act this way now is\nnothing short of madness!\"",
      "\"I asked Professor Quirrell why he'd laughed,\" the boy said\nevenly, \"after he awarded Hermione those hundred points. And\nProfessor Quirrell said, these aren't his exact words, but it's\npretty much what he said, that he'd found it tremendously amusing\nthat the great and good Albus Dumbledore had been sitting there\ndoing nothing as this poor innocent girl begged for help, while\nhe had been the one to defend her. And he told me then\nthat by the time good and moral people were done tying themselves\nup in knots, what they usually did was nothing; or, if they did\nact, you could hardly tell them apart from the people called bad.\nWhereas he could help innocent girls any time he felt like\nit, because he wasn't a good person. And that I ought to remember\nthat, any time I considered growing up to be good.\"",
      "The old wizard did not show the force of the blow. Only a slight\nwidening of his eyes would have betrayed it, if you had been\nwatching him very closely.",
      "\"Don't worry, Headmaster,\" said the boy. \"I haven't gotten my\nwires crossed. I know that I'm supposed to learn goodness from\nHermione and Fawkes, not from Professor Quirrell and you. Which\nbrings me to the actual reason why I came here. Hermione's time is\ntoo valuable to waste in detentions. Professor Snape will revoke\nit, claiming that I blackmailed him.\"",
      "After a hesitation the old wizard nodded his head, the silver\nbeard swaying slowly beneath. \"That would not be best for\nher, Harry,\" the old wizard said. \"But the detention can\nbe put down as being served with Professor Binns, and you and she\ncan study together in his classroom.\"",
      "\"Fine,\" the boy said. \"I think that was all the business we had\ntogether, in the end. You may expect, the next time you seem to be\nworking on the side of the bad guys or letting them win, that I\nwill do whatever I think Fawkes would tell me to, regardless of how\nmuch trouble comes of it. I hope we're both clear on that.\"",
      "Without another word, the boy turned and walked out of the room,\nthrough the open door of black metal, the words \"Lumos!\u202f\"\nand the light of his wand following a moment later.",
      "The old wizard stood there silent, silent amid the ruins of the\nlives which his own life had left behind. His wrinkled hand rose,\nshaking, to touch at his half-moon glasses -",
      "The boy poked his head back in. \"Would you mind switching on the\nstairs, Headmaster? I'd rather not go through all the work again to\nleave the same way I came.\"",
      "\"Go, Harry Potter,\" the old wizard said. \"The stairs will\nreceive you.\"",
      "(Some time later, an earlier version of Harry, who had invisibly\nwaited next to the gargoyles since 9PM, followed the Deputy\nHeadmistress through the opening that parted for her, stood quietly\nbehind her on the turning stairs until they came to the top, and\nthen, still under the Cloak, spun his Time-Turner thrice.)",
      "Aftermath: Professor Quirrell and -",
      "In a shadowy clearing the Defense Professor waited, his back\nleaned negligently against the rough grey bark of a towering beech\ntree as yet unleaved in the late March days, so that its trunk and\ncrown seemed like a pale arm reaching up from the ground and\nexploding into a hand of a thousand fingers. Around the Defense\nProfessor and above him were branches so dense that even in the\nearliest spring, with few trees so much as budding, you could have\nhardly seen the sky from the ground. The strands of the wooden net\ncrossed and proliferated so many times that if you were on a\nbroomstick above, searching for someone below, you would have found\nit easier to follow your ears than your eyes. Nor would it have\nhelped that it was almost dark amid the prohibited woods, the\nunseen sun almost set, so that only a few glows of fading sunlight\nilluminated the tops of the tallest trees.",
      "Then came the faintest sound of footsteps, almost inaudible even\non the forest ground; the gait of a man accustomed to passing\nunseen. No twig snapped, nor leaf rustled -",
      "\"Good afternoon,\" said Professor Quirrell. The Defense Professor\ndid not trouble to move his eyes, or his hands from where they\nrested negligently at his side.",
      "A figure clad in a black cloak shimmered into existence, his\nhead turning to look left and then right. In the figure's right\nhand, gripped low, was a wand of wood so grey it was almost\nsilver.",
      "\"I do not know why you wished to meet here of all\nplaces,\" said Severus Snape, his voice cool.",
      "\"Oh,\" Professor Quirrell said idly, as though the whole matter\nwas of the least importance, \"I thought you would prefer privacy.\nThe walls of Hogwarts have ears, and you would not wish the\nHeadmaster to know of your role in yesterday's affair, would\nyou?\"",
      "The March chill seemed to grow deeper, the temperature further\nfall. \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" the Potions Master\nsaid icily.",
      "\"You know perfectly well what we're talking about,\" said\nProfessor Quirrell in an amused voice. \"Really, my good Professor,\nyou should not meddle in the affairs of idiots unless you are ready\nto defend yourself upon the instant from all their violence.\" (The\nDefense Professor's hands still lay relaxed and open at his side.)\n\"And yet none of those idiots seem to remember the sight of you\nfalling, nor do the young ladies recall your presence. Which raises\nthe fascinating question of why you would go to the extraordinary\nlength, I dare say the desperate length, of casting\nfifty-two Memory Charms.\" Professor Quirrell tilted his\nhead. \"Would you fear so much the opinions of mere students? I\nthink not. Would you dread the matter becoming known to your good\nfriend, Lord Malfoy? But those fools, upon the very spot, invented\na quite satisfactory excuse for your presence. No, there is only\none person who holds so much power over you, and who would be most\nperturbed to find you executing any plot without his knowledge.\nYour true and hidden master, Albus Dumbledore.\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" hissed the Potions Master, the anger plain\nupon his face.",
      "\"But now, it seems, you are moving on your own; and so I find\nmyself most intrigued as to what you could possibly be\ndoing, and why.\" The Defense Professor regarded the black-clad\nsilhouette of the Potions Master with the scrutiny a man might give\nan exceptionally interesting bug, even if it was still ultimately\njust a bug.",
      "\"I am no servant of Dumbledore's,\" the Potions Master said\ncoldly.",
      "\"Really? What astonishing news.\" The Defense Professor smiled\nslightly. \"Do tell me all about it.\"",
      "There was a long pause. From some tree an owl hooted, the sound\nhuge in the silence; neither man startled or flinched.",
      "\"You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell,\" Severus Snape said,\nhis voice very soft.",
      "\"I don't?\" said Professor Quirrell. \"How would you know?\"",
      "\"On the other hand,\" the Potions Master continued, voice still\nsoft, \"my friends enjoy many advantages.\"",
      "The man leaning against the grey bark raised his eyebrows. \"Such\nas?\"",
      "\"There is much that I know of this school,\" said the Potions\nMaster. \"Things you might not think I knew.\"",
      "There was an expectant pause.",
      "\"How incredibly fascinating,\" said Professor Quirrell. The man\nwas examining his fingernails with a bored look. \"Do go on.\"",
      "\"I know you have been... investigating... the\nthird-floor corridor -\"",
      "\"You know nothing of the sort.\" The man's back straightened\nagainst the wood. \"Do not bluff against me, Severus Snape; I find\nit annoying, and you are in no position to annoy me. A single\nglance would tell any competent wizard that the Headmaster has\nlaced that corridor with a ridiculous quantity of wards and webs,\ntriggers and tripsigns. And more: there are Charms laid there of\nancient power, magical constructs of which I have heard not even\nrumors, techniques that must have been disgorged from the hoarded\nlore of Flamel himself. Even He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named would have\nhad trouble passing those without notice.\" Professor Quirrell\ntapped a thoughtful finger on his cheek. \"And for the actual lock,\na Colloportus laid on an ordinary doorknob, cast so weakly\nthat it could not have kept out Miss Granger on the day she entered\nHogwarts. Never before in my existence have I encountered such a\nblatant trap.\" Now the Defense Professor narrowed his eyes. \"I know\nof no one left in the world against whom such fantastic feats of\ndetection would serve any useful purpose. If there is some wizard\npossessed of ancient lore, of whom I know nothing, against whom\nthis trap is set - you may trade that information for as\nmuch silence as you like, my dear Professor, and a good serving of\nmy favor left over afterward.\"",
      "You could have sworn that Professor Quirrell was watching\nSeverus Snape with keen interest. Not the faintest trace of a smile\ncrossed the man's lips.",
      "There was another long silence in the clearing.",
      "\"I do not know who Dumbledore fears,\" Snape said. \"But\nI know what bait he has set out, and somewhat of how it is truly\nguarded -\"",
      "\"As to that,\" said Professor Quirrell, sounding bored again, \"I\nstole it months ago, and left a fake in its place. But thank you\nkindly for asking.\"",
      "\"You're lying,\" said Severus Snape after a pause.",
      "\"Yes, I am.\" Professor Quirrell leaned back against the grey\nwood again, his eyes drifting up to the dense net of branches, the\nfalling night scarcely visible between the complex crossings. \"I\nsimply wished to learn whether you would call me on it, since you\nare pretending to know so little.\" The Defense Professor smiled to\nhimself.",
      "The Potions Master looked like he was about to choke on his own\nfury. \"What do you want?\u202f\"",
      "\"Nothing, really,\" said the Defense Professor, continuing to\ngaze at the forest ceiling. \"I was only curious. I suppose I shall\njust watch and see where your plotting goes, and meanwhile I will\nsay nothing to the Headmaster - so long as you are willing to do me\na favor now and then, of course.\" A dry smile crossed the face.\n\"You are dismissed for now, Severus Snape. Though I wouldn't mind\nhaving another little chat soon, if you're willing to speak with me\nhonestly of where your loyalties lie. And I do mean\nhonestly, not the false faces you've shown today. You\nmight find you have more allies than you thought. Take some time to\nthink it over, my friend.\"",
      "Aftermath: Draco Malfoy and -",
      "A rainbow hemisphere, a dome of solid force with little\nchromaticity of its own which sent back the infringing light in\nsplintered reflections, iridescent in many colors, as it fractured\nthe shine of the many-splendored chandeliers of the Slytherin\ncommon room.",
      "Sheltered beneath the rainbow hemisphere, the terrified face of\na young witch who had never fought bullies, who had not joined any\nof Professor Quirrell's armies, who was getting Acceptable marks at\nbest in her Defense class, who could not have cast a Prismatic\nBarrier even to save her own life.",
      "\"Oh, stop it,\" said Draco Malfoy, making his voice sound bored\ndespite the sweat that had broken out underneath his robes, as he\nkept his wand pointed at the barrier that was sheltering Millicent\nBulstrode.",
      "He couldn't remember making the decision, there'd just been the\ntwo older boys about to hex Millicent, the common room silently\nstaring, and then Draco's hand had just drawn his wand and cast the\nbarrier, leaving his heart to pump itself full of shocked\nadrenaline while his poor sad brain frantically racked itself for\nexplanations -",
      "The two older boys were straightening up from where they'd been\nlooming over Millicent, turning to Draco, looking at him with a\nmixture of shock and anger. Gregory and Vincent beside him had\nalready drawn their own wands, but weren't pointing them. All three\nof them together couldn't have won, anyway.",
      "But the older boys wouldn't hex him. Nobody could possibly be\nstupid enough to hex the next Lord Malfoy.",
      "It wasn't fear of being hexed that was making Draco sweat\nbeneath his robes, as he desperately hoped the beads of water\nweren't visible on his forehead.",
      "Draco was sweating because of the dawning and sickening\ncertainty that even if he got away with this now, if he kept down\nthis path, there would come a time when it would all come crashing\ndown; and then he might not be the next Lord Malfoy anymore.",
      "\"Mr. Malfoy,\" said the oldest-looking boy. \"Why are you\nprotecting her?\"",
      "\"So you've located the mistress of the conspiracy,\" Draco said\nwith a Number Two Sneer, \"and it's, let me get this straight now, a\nfirst-year girl named Millicent Bulstrode. She's just a\nconduit, you niddlewit!\u202f\"",
      "\"So?\" demanded the older boy. \"She still helped them!\"",
      "Draco lifted his wand and the Prismatic Sphere winked out. Still\ntalking in a bored voice, Draco said, \"Did you know what\nyou were doing, Miss Bulstrode?\"",
      "\"N-no,\" Millicent stammered from where she was still sitting at\nher desk.",
      "\"Did you know where the Slytherin messages you were passing on\nwere going to?\"",
      "\"No!\" said Millicent.",
      "\"Thank you,\" Draco said. \"All of you please leave her alone,\nshe's just a pawn. Miss Bulstrode, you may consider the favor you\ndid me in February to have been repaid.\" And Draco turned back to\nhis Potions homework, hoping to Merlin and back again that\nMillicent didn't say anything incredibly stupid like 'What favor?'\n-",
      "\"Then why,\" a voice said clearly from across the room, \"did\nthose witches go where a note from Millicent told them to go?\"",
      "Sweating even more, Draco lifted his head again to look at where\nRandolph Lee had spoken. \"What did the fake note say exactly?\" said\nDraco. \"Was it, 'I command you to go forth in the name of the Dark\nLady Bulstrode' or 'Please meet me here, sincerely Millicent?'\"",
      "Randolph Lee opened his mouth, hesitated for a fractional second\n-",
      "\"I thought so,\" said Draco. \"That wasn't a very good test, Mr.\nLee, it - it can -\" A frantic, nerve-racking moment while he\nfigured out how to say it without using Harry-words like false\npositive. \"It can get the witches to go there if any of them\nis just friends with Millicent.\"",
      "As though the matter had been entirely settled, Draco looked\ndown again at his Potions homework, ignoring (except for the\nfeeling of sick dread in his stomach) the whispers from around the\nroom.",
      "It was only out of the corner of his eye that he caught Gregory\nstaring at him.",
      "Draco's eyes rested on his Astronomy homework, but he couldn't\nmake his mind focus there. If you were trying not to think about\nthings Harry Potter had said, pretty much the worst possible thing\nyou could do was look at your textbook's pictures of the night sky,\nand try to remember what you weren't supposed to know\nabout how the planets wandered. Astronomy, a noble and prestigious\nart, a sign of learning and knowledge; only Muggles possessed\nsecret modern artifacts which could do it a million billion times\nbetter using methods that Harry had tried to explain and which\nDraco still couldn't begin to understand except that apparently it\ndidn't even take magic to make things do\nArithmancy.",
      "Draco looked at the pictures of constellations, and wondered if\nit was like this in the other Houses, if people were always\nthreatening each other in Ravenclaw.",
      "Harry Potter had told him once that soldiers on a battlefield\ndidn't really fight for their country. Patriotism might get them to\nthe battlefield in the first place, but once they were there, they\nfought to protect each other, the friends they'd trained\nwith who were right in front of them. And Harry had observed, and\nDraco had known that it was true, that you couldn't use loyalty to\na leader to power a Patronus Charm, it wasn't quite the\nright kind of warm and happy thought. But thinking of protecting\nsomeone beside you -",
      "That, Harry Potter had said thoughtfully, was probably why the\nDeath Eaters had fallen apart the moment the Dark Lord had\ndeparted. They hadn't been warm enough to each other.",
      "You could recruit a group that included Bellatrix Black and\nAmycus Carrow alongside Lord Malfoy and Mr. MacNair, and keep them\nin line with the Cruciatus Curse. But the instant the master of the\nDark Mark was gone, you didn't have an army anymore, you had a\ncircle of acquaintances. That was why Father had failed. It hadn't\neven really been his fault. There'd been nothing Father\ncould have done, after inheriting Death Eaters who weren't\nreally friends with each other.",
      "And even though it was Slytherin House he was supposed to defend\n- Slytherin House which he and Harry had formed a pact to\nsave - sometimes Draco couldn't help but think that it was\njust less wearisome when he was leading army practices.\nWhen he was working with students from the other three Houses that\nweren't Slytherin. Once you saw and named the problems, you\ncouldn't stop seeing them, it just got more\nannoying every day.",
      "\"Mr. Malfoy?\" said the voice of Gregory Goyle, from where he was\nlying on the floor beside Draco's desk, in the small but private\nbedroom; Gregory was doing his Transfiguration homework, on which\nhe often needed help.",
      "Any distraction was welcome at this point. \"Yes?\" said\nDraco.",
      "\"You weren't really plotting against Granger at all,\" said\nGregory. \"Were you?\"",
      "The sensation spreading through Draco's stomach felt just like\nGregory's voice sounded, sickened and afraid.",
      "\"You actually were helping Granger, that day you picked her up\noff the floor,\" said Gregory. \"And before, that time you kept her\nfrom falling off the roof. You helped a mudblood\n-\"",
      "\"Yeah, right,\" said Draco sarcastically, without the slightest\nhesitation or delay, looking back down at his Astronomy homework\nlike he wasn't the least bit nervous. It was all happening the way\nDraco had feared it would, but at least that meant he'd played this\nconversation in his head over and over, coming up with the right\nopening gambit. \"Come on, Gregory, you've dueled General Granger,\nyou know how strong her spells are. Like a real\nMuggle-spawn is going to be more powerful than you, more powerful\nthan Theodore, more powerful than every single pureblood in our\nwhole school year except me? Don't you actually believe in\nanything Father says? She's adopted. Her parents died in\nthe war and someone stuck her with a couple of Muggles to hide her.\nNo way is General Granger a real mudblood.\"",
      "A slow pulse of silence through Draco's bedroom. Draco wanted to\nknow, needed to know what look was on Gregory's face. But he\ncouldn't look up from his desk, not yet, not until Gregory\nspoke first.",
      "And then -",
      "\"Is that what Harry Potter said to you?\" said\nGregory.",
      "The voice wavered, and broke. When Draco looked up from his\nhomework, he saw that tears were leaking out of Gregory's eyes.",
      "Apparently that hadn't worked.",
      "\"I don't know what to do,\" Gregory said in a whisper. \"I don't\nknow what to do now, Mr. Malfoy. Your father isn't - when he finds\nout - he's not going to like it, Mr. Malfoy!\"",
      "It's not your job to decide what Father will like,\nGoyle -",
      "Draco could hear the words in his head; they sounded in Father's\nvoice, with the same sternness. It was the sort of thing Father had\ntold him to say, if Vincent or Gregory ever questioned\nhim; and if that didn't work he was to hex them. They were\nnot equal friends, Father had said, and he wasn't ever to\nforget it. Draco was in charge, they were his servants, and if\nDraco couldn't keep it that way then he wasn't fit to inherit House\nMalfoy...",
      "\"It's all right, Gregory,\" Draco said, as gently as he could.\n\"All you've got to do is worry about protecting me. Nobody's going\nto blame you for following my orders, not my father, not yours.\"\nPutting all the warmth he could into his voice, like trying to cast\na Patronus Charm. \"And anyway, the next war isn't going to be the\nsame as the last one. House Malfoy was around long before the Dark\nLord, and not every Lord Malfoy does the same thing. Father knows\nthat.\"",
      "\"Does he?\" said Gregory in trembling voice. \"Does he\nreally?\u202f\"",
      "Draco nodded. \"Professor Quirrell knows it too,\" said Draco.\n\"That's what the armies are about. The Defense Professor's right,\nwhen the next war comes, Father won't be able to unite the whole\ncountry, they'll remember the last war. But anyone who's\nfought in Professor Quirrell's armies will remember who the\nstrongest generals were, they'll know who's worthy to lead them.\nThey'll proclaim Harry Potter their Lord, and I'll be his right\nhand, and House Malfoy will come out on top, like always. People\nmight even turn to me, if Potter isn't there, so long as\nthey think I'm trustworthy. That's what I'm setting up now. Father\nwill understand.\"",
      "Gregory reached up and wiped his eyes, looking down again at his\nTransfiguration homework. \"Okay,\" Gregory said in a shaky voice.\n\"If you say so, Mr. Malfoy.\"",
      "Draco nodded again, ignoring the hollow feeling inside himself\nat the lies he'd just told his friend, and turned back to the\nstars.",
      "Aftermath: Hermione Granger and -",
      "Being invisible should've been more interesting than\nthis, the corridors of Hogwarts should have been outlined in\nstrange colors or something. But actually, Hermione thought, being\nunder Harry's invisibility cloak was exactly like not\nbeing under an invisibility cloak, except for the cloak part. When\nyou pulled the veil of soft black cloth down from the hood and over\nyour face, you couldn't even see it stretching in front of you, and\nafterward it didn't seem to impede your breathing. And the world\nlooked just the same, except that when you walked past things of\nmetal, you didn't see any small reflections of yourself. Portraits\nnever looked at you, only did whatever strange things they did when\nthey were alone. Hermione hadn't tried walking past a mirror yet,\nshe wasn't sure she wanted to. Most of all, there was no\nyou anymore as you walked around, no hands, no feet, just\na changing point of view. It was an unnerving feeling, not so much\nof being invisible as of not existing.",
      "Harry hadn't questioned her at all, she'd just got out the word\n'invisibility' and then Harry was drawing his invisibility cloak\nfrom his pouch. She hadn't even been given a chance to explain\nabout her extremely secret meeting with Daphne and Millicent\nBulstrode, or that she thought it would help protect the other\ngirls, Harry had just handed over what was probably a Deathly\nHallow. If you were fair, and she did try to be fair, she\nhad to admit that sometimes Harry could be a very true, true\nfriend.",
      "The secret meeting itself had been a great big failure.",
      "Millicent had claimed to be a seer.",
      "Hermione had carefully explained to Millicent and Daphne at\nconsiderable length that this could not possibly be true.",
      "She and Harry had looked up Divination early on in their\nresearch; Harry had insisted that they read everything they could\nfind about prophecies that wasn't in the Restricted Section. As\nHarry had observed, it would save a lot of effort if they could\njust get a seer to prophesy everything they would figure out\nthirty-five years later. (Or to put it in Harry's terms, any means\nof obtaining information transmitted from the distant future was\npotentially an instant global victory condition.)",
      "But, as Hermione had explained to Millicent, prophesying wasn't\ncontrollable, there was no way to ask for a prophecy about\nanything in particular. Instead (the books had said) there was a\nsort of pressure that built up in Time, when some huge\nevent was trying to happen, or stop itself from happening. And\nseers were like weak points that let out the pressure, when the\nright listener was nearby. So prophecies were only about big,\nimportant things, because only that generated enough pressure; and\nyou almost never got more than one seer saying the same thing,\nbecause afterward the pressure was gone. And, as Hermione had\nfurther explained to Millicent, the seers themselves didn't\nremember their prophecies, because the message wasn't for\nthem. And the messages would come out in riddles, and only\nsomeone who heard the prophecy in the seer's original voice would\nhear all the meaning that was in the riddle. There was no\npossible way that Millicent could just give out a prophecy\nany time she wanted, about school bullies, and\nthen remember it, and if she had it would've come\nout as 'the skeleton is the key' and not 'Susan Bones has to be\nthere'.",
      "Millicent had been looking rather frightened at this point, so\nHermione had relaxed her fists where they'd been jammed on her\nhips, calmed herself down, and stated carefully that she was glad\nMillicent had helped them, but they had sometimes walked\ninto traps following what Millicent said, and so Hermione really\ndid want to know where the messages had actually come\nfrom.",
      "And Millicent had said in a small voice:",
      "But, but she told me that she was a\nseer...",
      "Hermione had told Daphne not to press it, after Millicent had\nrefused to give up her source. It wasn't just that Hermione had\nfelt awful about the scared look on Millicent's face. It was that\nHermione had a strong feeling that if they did find the\nperson who'd been telling Millicent things, why, they\nwould turn out to just be finding envelopes under their pillow in\nthe morning.",
      "She was getting that same despairing feeling she'd gotten in the\nbattle before Christmas, looking at Zabini's charts with all the\ncolored lines and boxes and... and she had only just now realized\nwhat it meant that Zabini had been the one showing her\nthat chart.",
      "Even for a Ravenclaw, she felt, there was such a thing as having\nyour life get overly complicated.",
      "Hermione began ascending a short spiral of yellow marble steps\nprotruding from a central spine, a poorly-kept \"secret\" staircase\nthat was actually one of the fastest ways up from the Slytherin\ndungeons to the Ravenclaw tower, but which only witches could\ntraverse. (Why girls in particular needed a quick way to move from\nRavenclaw to Slytherin and back was something Hermione found a bit\npuzzling.) At the top of the staircase, now that she was away from\nSlytherin places and back into the main parts of Hogwarts, Hermione\nstopped and took off Harry's invisibility cloak.",
      "After her pouch had swallowed the cloak, Hermione turned right\nand started to walk down a short passageway, now automatically\nkeeping an eye out in all directions without really thinking about\nit, and her constantly-scanning eyes glanced into a shadowy alcove\n-",
      "(fleeting disorientation)",
      "- and then a rush of shock and fear hit her like a Stunning Hex\nover her whole body, she found that without any thought or any\nconscious decision her wand had leaped into her hand and was\nalready pointed at...",
      "...a black cloak so wide and billowing that it was impossible to\ndetermine whether the figure beneath was male or female, and atop\nthe cloak a broad-brimmed black hat; and a black mist seemed to\ngather beneath it and obscure the face of whoever or whatever might\nlie beneath.",
      "\"Hello again, Hermione,\" whispered a sibilant voice from beneath\nthe black hat, from behind the black mist.",
      "Hermione's heart was already pounding hugely inside her chest,\nher witch's robes felt already sweat-dampened against her skin,\nthere was a taste of fear already in her mouth; she didn't know why\nshe was so suddenly filled up with adrenaline but her hand gripped\nharder on her wand. \"Who are you?\" Hermione demanded.",
      "The hat tilted slightly; the whispery voice, when it came forth\nfrom the black mist, sounded dry as dust. \"The last ally,\" spoke\nthe sibilant whisper. \"The one who finally answers, when no other\nwill answer you. I am perhaps the only true friend you\nhave in all Hogwarts, Hermione. For you have now seen how the\nothers stayed silent when you were in need -\"",
      "\"What's your name?\u202f\"",
      "The black cloak rotated slightly, back and forth, it didn't\nlook like shoulders shrugging, but it conveyed a shrug.\n\"That is the riddle, young Ravenclaw. Until you solve it, you may\ncall me whatever you wish.\"",
      "She could feel her palm already sweaty and was thankful for the\nspiral grooves on her wand that helped her hand keep a steady grip\non the wood. \"Well, Mister Incredibly Suspicious Person,\" Hermione\nsaid, \"what do you want with me?\"",
      "\"That is the wrong question,\" came the whisper from black mist.\n\"You should ask, rather, what I can offer\nyou.\"",
      "\"No,\" the young girl said quite steadily, \"I don't think I\nshould be asking that, actually.\"",
      "A high-pitched chuckle from behind the black mist. \"Not power,\"\nwhispered the voice, \"not wealth, you care little for such things,\ndo you, young Ravenclaw? Knowledge. That is what I\npossess. I know what is unfolding within this school, all the\nhidden plans and players, the answers of the riddle. I know the\ntrue reason for the coldness you see in Harry Potter's eyes. I know\nthe true nature of Professor Quirrell's mysterious illness. I know\nwho Dumbledore truly fears.\"",
      "\"Good for you,\" said Hermione Granger. \"But do you know how many\nlicks it takes to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie\nPop?\"",
      "The black mist seemed to darken slightly, the voice sounded\nlower when it spoke, disappointed. \"So you are not even curious,\nyoung Ravenclaw, about the truths behind the lies?\"",
      "\"One hundred and eighty-seven,\" she said. \"I tried it once and\nthat's how many it came out to.\" Her hand was almost slipping on\nher wand, there was a sense of fatigue in her fingers like she'd\nbeen holding the wand for hours instead of minutes -",
      "The voice hissed, \"Professor Snape is a hidden Death Eater.\"",
      "Hermione almost dropped her wand.",
      "\"Ah,\" the voice whispered in satisfaction. \"I thought that might\ninterest you. So, Hermione. Is there anything else you would like\nto know about your enemies, or those you call friends?\"",
      "She stared up at the black mist that topped the towering black\ncloak, frantically trying to order her thoughts. Professor Snape\nwas a Death Eater? Who would tell her something like that,\nwhy, what was going on? \"That's -\" Hermione said.\nHer voice was quavering. \"That's extremely serious business, if\nit's really true. Why are you telling something like that to\nme, and not to Headmaster Dumbledore?\"",
      "\"Dumbledore did nothing to stop Snape,\" the black mist\nwhispered. \"You saw it, Hermione. The rot at Hogwarts begins at the\ntop. Everything that is wrong with this school, it all begins with\nthe mad Headmaster. You alone dared to call him out for it - and\ntherefore I speak to you.\"",
      "\"And have you also spoken to Harry Potter, then?\" Hermoine said,\nkeeping her voice as even as she could. If this was his\nhelpful ghost -",
      "The black mist darkened and lightened, like a shake of the head.\n\"I am frightened of Harry Potter,\" it whispered. \"Of the coldness\nin his eyes, of the darkness that grows behind them. Harry Potter\nis a killer, and anyone who is an obstacle to him will die. Even\nyou, Hermione Granger, if you dare truly oppose him, the darkness\nbehind his eyes will reach out and destroy you. This I know.\"",
      "\"Then you don't know half of what you pretend to know,\" Hermione\nsaid, her voice a little firmer. \"I'm scared of Harry too. But not\nbecause of what he might ever do to me. I'm scared of what\nhe might do to protect me -\"",
      "\"Wrong.\" The whisper was flat, and hard, as if to brook no\npossibility of denial. \"Harry Potter will turn against you\nin time, Hermione, when the darkness takes him fully. He will not\nshed a tear, he will not even notice, on the day his footsteps\nfinally crush you underneath.\"",
      "\"Double wrong!\" she said back in a rising voice, even\nthough there were chills going down her spine. One of Harry's\nphrases came to her. \"Just what do you think you know, and how do\nyou think you know it, anyway?\"",
      "\"Time -\" The voice seemed to catch itself. \"Time enough for that\nlater. For now, for today, indeed Harry Potter is not your enemy.\nAnd yet you are in gravest danger.\"",
      "\"I can believe that,\" said Hermione Granger. She\ndesperately wanted to shift her wand to her other hand, she felt\nlike she needed to grab her right arm just to keep it up, her head\nached like she'd been staring at the black mist for days; she\ndidn't know why she'd gotten tired so quickly.",
      "\"Lucius Malfoy has taken notice of you, Hermione.\" The whisper\nhad risen, departed from its tonelessness, taken on a note of\naudible concern. \"You have humiliated Slytherin House, you have\ndefeated his son in battle. Even before then you were an\nembarrassment to all who stand with the Death Eaters; for you are a\nMuggleborn and yet you possess a power of wizardry greater than any\npureblood. And now you are becoming known, the eyes of the world on\nyou. Lucius Malfoy seeks to crush you, Hermione, to hurt you and\nperhaps even kill you, and he has the means to do it!\" The whisper\nhad grown urgent.",
      "There was a pause.",
      "\"Is that all?\" Hermione said. If she was ex-Colonel Zabini or\nHarry Potter, she'd probably be asking clever questions to gather\nmore information; but her mind felt slow and fatigued. She really\nneeded to get out of here and go lie down for a while.",
      "\"You don't believe me,\" the whisper said, softer and sadder now.\n\"Why not, Hermione? I am trying to help you.\"",
      "Hermione took a step backward, away from the shadowy alcove.",
      "\"Why not, Hermione?\u202f\" demanded the voice, rising to a\nhiss. \"You owe me that much! Tell me, and then -\" The voice caught,\nand came back quieter. \"And then you can go, I suppose. Only tell\nme - why -\"",
      "Maybe she shouldn't've answered; maybe she should've just turned\nand fled, or better yet, cast a Prismatic Wall first and then\nscreamed at the top of her lungs as she ran; but it was the note of\nreal pain in the voice that caught her, and so she answered.",
      "\"Because you look incredibly dark and scary and suspicious,\"\nHermione said, keeping her voice polite, as her wand stayed level\non the towering black cloak and the faceless black mist.",
      "\"That's all?\u202f\" whispered the voice incredulously.\nSadness seemed to infuse it. \"I hoped for better from you,\nHermione. Surely such a Ravenclaw as you, the most intelligent\nRavenclaw to grace Hogwarts in a generation, knows that appearances\ncan be misleading.\"",
      "\"Oh, I know it,\" said Hermione. She took another step back, her\ntired fingers tightening on the wand. \"But the thing that people\nforget sometimes, is that even though appearances can be\nmisleading, they're usually not.\"",
      "There was a pause.",
      "\"You are the clever one,\" said the voice, and the black\nmist evaporated away, no longer obscuring; she saw the face\nbeneath, and recognition sent a jolt of terrified adrenaline\nbursting through her -",
      "(fleeting disorientation)",
      "- and then a rush of shock and fear hit her like a Stunning Hex\nover her whole body, she found that without any thought or any\nconscious decision her wand had leaped into her hand and was\nalready pointed at...",
      "...a shining lady, her long white dress billowing about her as\nthough in invisible winds; neither her hands nor her feet were\nvisible, her face hidden beneath a white veil; and she was glowing\nall over, not like a ghost, not transparent, just surrounded by\nsoft white light.",
      "Hermione stared open-mouthed at the gentle sight, wondering why\nher heart was already hammering, and why she felt so scared.",
      "\"Hello again, Hermione,\" the kindly whisper emanated from the\nwhite glow behind the veil. \"I've been sent to help you, so please\ndon't be afraid. I am your servant in all things; for you, my Lady,\nare the bearer of a most marvelous destiny -\"",

      "It was Saturday, on the 4th of April, in the year 1992.",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Davis looked rather nervous, as they sat in a\ncertain special section of the Hogwarts Quidditch stands - though\ntoday the cushioned benches did not look upon flying broomsticks,\nbut rather viewed a gigantic square of something like parchment; a\ngreat white blankness soon to flicker with windows into grass and\nsoldiers. For now it showed only the reflected dull gray color of\nthe surrounding overcast skies. (Looking rather stormy, though the\nweather-wizards had promised that the rain wouldn't break before\nnightfall.)",
      "Ordinarily it was the ancient tradition of Hogwarts that mere\nparents were to Stay Out - for much the same reason that impatient\nchildren are told to get out of the kitchen and not meddle in the\ncook's affairs. The only reason for a parent-teacher conference was\nif a teacher felt that a parent wasn't shaping up properly. It took\nan exceptional circumstance to make the Hogwarts administration\nfeel that it had to justify itself to you. On any given\noccasion, generally speaking, the Hogwarts administration was\nbacked up by eight hundred years of distinguished history and you\nwere not.",
      "Thus it had been with some trepidation that Mr. and Mrs. Davis\nhad insisted on an audience with Deputy Headmistress McGonagall. It\nwas hard to muster a proper sense of indignation when you were\nconfronting the same dignified witch who, twelve years and four\nmonths earlier, had given both of you two weeks' detention after\ncatching you in the act of conceiving Tracey.",
      "On the other hand, Mr. and Mrs. Davis's courage had been helped\nby angrily waving about a copy of The Quibbler\nwhose headline showed, in bright bold text for all the world to\nsee:",
      "PACTS WITH POTTER?\nBONES, DAVIS, GRANGER\nIN LOVE RECTANGLE OF FEAR",
      "And so Mr. and Mrs. Davis had argued their way into the Faculty\nBox of the Hogwarts Quidditch stands, where they were now ensconced\nwith an excellent view of Professor Quirrell's enchanted screens,\nso that the two of them could see for themselves \"Just what the\nFiddly-Snocks has been going on in this school, if you'll pardon\nthe expression, Deputy Headmistress McGonagall!\"",
      "Seated to the left of Mr. Davis was another concerned parent, a\nwhite-haired man in elegant black robes of unmatchable quality, one\nLucius Malfoy, political leader of the strongest faction of the\nWizengamot.",
      "To the left of Lord Malfoy, a sneeringly aristocratic man with a\nscarred face who had been introduced to them as Lord Jugson.",
      "Then an elderly but sharp-eyed fellow named Charles Nott,\nrumored to be nearly as wealthy as Lord Malfoy, seated on Lord\nJugson's left.",
      "On the right of Mrs. Davis, one would find the comely Lady and\nyet handsomer Lord of the Noble and Most Ancient House of\nGreengrass. Young they were as wizards counted age, garbed in grey\nsilken robes set with tiny dark emeralds embroidered into the shape\nof grass blades. The Lady Greengrass was considered a key swing\nvote on the Wizengamot, her own mother having retired from the body\nwith surprising speed. Her charming husband, though his family was\nnot noble or wealthy of itself, had taken a seat on the Hogwarts\nBoard of Governors.",
      "To their right, a square-jawed and incredibly tough-looking old\nwitch, who had shaken hands with Mr. and Mrs. Davis without the\nslightest hint of condescension. This was Amelia Bones, Director of\nthe Department of Magical Law Enforcement.",
      "To Amelia's right was a seniorish woman who had set the fashion\nscene of magical Britain on its ear by integrating a live vulture\ninto her hat, one Augusta Longbottom. Though she was not addressed\nas Lady, Madam Longbottom would exercise the full rights of the\nLongbottom family for so long as their last scion had yet to attain\nhis majority, and she was considered a prominent figure in a\nminority faction of the Wizengamot.",
      "At the side of Madam Longbottom was seated none other than Chief\nWarlock Supreme Mugwump Headmaster Albus Percival Wulfric Brian\nDumbledore, legendary defeater of Grindelwald, protector of\nBritain, rediscoverer of the fabled twelve uses of dragon's blood,\nthe most powerful wizard in the world &c.",
      "And finally, on the far right, one would find the enigmatic\nDefense Professor of Hogwarts, Quirinus Quirrell, who was leaning\nback on the cushioned benches as though resting; seeming entirely\nand naturally at ease in the rarefied company of a voting quorum of\nthe Hogwarts Board of Governors, which had dropped by on this fine\nSaturday to learn just what the Fiddly-Snocks had been going on at\nHogwarts in general and with Draco Malfoy, Theodore Nott, Daphne\nGreengrass, Susan Bones, and Neville Longbottom in particular. The\nname of Harry Potter had also been much discussed.",
      "Oh, and one mustn't forget Tracey Davis, of course. Director\nBones's eyebrows had climbed in some interest upon hearing the\nyoung couple introduced as her parents. Lord Jugson had given them\na brief, incredulous stare before dismissing them with a snort.\nLucius Malfoy had greeted them politely, his smile containing a\nhint of grim amusement mixed with pity.",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Davis, whose last vote on anything of significance\nhad been touching their wands to the name of Minister Fudge, who\nhad all of three hundred Galleons stored in their Gringotts vault,\nand who respectively worked at selling cauldrons in a Potions shop\nand enchanting Omnioculars, were pressed up tightly against each\nother, sitting rigidly erect upon their cushioned benches, and\ndesperately wishing they'd worn nicer robes.",
      "The sky above was a solid mass of cloud dispersed into darker\nand lighter grays, grim with the promise of future storms; though\nno lightning flickered as yet, nor distant rumbles of thunder\nechoed; and only a few threatening droplets had fallen.",
      "To their designated starting place in a certain forest, the\nSunshine Regiment marched, though it was really more like a slow\nwalk; you wouldn't want to tire yourself out before the battle even\nstarted, and the breezes of April were annoyingly humid, though\ncool. Ahead of them, a yellow flame wandered slowly through the\nair, guiding them according to their pace.",
      "Susan Bones kept throwing worried glances toward the Sunshine\nGeneral as they marched through the grayly illuminated forest.\nProfessor Snape's going after Hermione seemed to have really shaken\nher. Hermione had even missed her Sunshine Regiment Official\nPlanning Meeting, which seemed understandable enough; but when\nSusan had offered her sympathy afterward, Hermione had stammered\nthat she'd lost track of time, which wasn't at all a usual thing\nfor her to say, and the girl had looked exhausted and frightened\nlike she'd just spent three days locked in a bathroom stall with a\nDementor. Even now, when all the Sunshine General's focus should've\nbeen on the coming battle, the Ravenclaw girl's gaze was constantly\ndarting in all directions, as though she expected Dark Wizards to\njump out of the bushes and sacrifice her.",
      "\"The ban on Muggle artifacts cuts down our options a lot,\"\nAnthony Goldstein was saying in the dour tones the boy used to\ndenote deliberate pessimism. \"I had the idea of trying to\nTransfigure nets to throw on people, but -\"",
      "\"No good,\" said Ernie Macmillan. The Hufflepuff boy shook his\nhead, looking even more serious than Anthony. \"I mean, it's just\nlike throwing a hex, they'd dodge.\"",
      "Anthony nodded. \"That's what I figured, too. Do you have any\nideas, Seamus?\"",
      "The former Chaotic Lieutenant still looked a bit nervous and\nout-of-place, marching along with his new comrades in the Sunshine\nRegiment. \"Sorry,\" said the newly minted Captain Finnigan. \"I'm\nmore the strategic master type.\"",
      "\"I'm the strategic master type,\" said Ron Weasley,\nsounding put-off.",
      "\"There are three armies,\" the Sunshine General said\nacerbically, \"which means we fight two armies at once,\nwhich means we need more than one strategist, which means shut up,\nRon!\"",
      "Ron gave their General a surprised and worried look. \"Hey,\" the\nGryffindor boy said in a calming tone, \"you shouldn't let Snape get\nto you so much -\"",
      "\"What do you think we ought to do, General?\" Susan said\nvery loudly and quickly. \"I mean, we don't really have a plan at\nthis point.\" Their official planning session had failed\namazingly with Hermione gone and both Ron and Anthony\nthinking they were in charge.",
      "\"Do we really need a plan?\" the Sunshine General said, sounding\na little distracted. \"We've got you and me and Lavender and Parvati\nand Hannah and Daphne and Ron and Ernie and Anthony and\nCaptain Finnigan.\"",
      "\"That -\" began Anthony.",
      "\"Sounds like a pretty good strategy,\" Ron said with an approving\nnod. \"We've got as many strong soldiers now as both other armies\nput together. Chaos's only got Potter and Longbottom and Nott left\n- well, and Zabini too, I suppose -\"",
      "\"And Tracey,\" said Hermione.",
      "Several people swallowed nervously.",
      "\"Oh, stop it,\" Susan said sharply. \"She's just a battle-hardened\nmember of S.P.H.E.W., that's all General Sunshine means.\"",
      "\"Still,\" Ernie said, turning to look seriously at Susan, \"I\nthink you'd better go with whatever group fights Chaos, Captain\nBones. I know you can't use your double magical powers except when\ninnocents are in danger, but I mean - just in case Miss Davis\ndoes, you know, go out of control and try to eat someone's\nsoul -\"",
      "\"I can handle her,\" Susan told him, keeping her voice\nreassuring. Admittedly, Susan hadn't been replaced by a\nMetamorphmagus at the moment, but then Tracey probably wasn't\nPolyjuiced Dumbledore or whoever.",
      "Captain Finnigan intoned in a deep, sort-of-rumbling voice, \"I\nfind your lack of skepticism disturbing.\" He raised his hand with\nhis thumb and forefinger almost touching, pointed at Ernie.",
      "For some reason Anthony Goldstein seemed to be having a sudden\nchoking fit. \"What's that supposed to mean?\" said Ernie.",
      "\"It's just something General Potter says sometimes,\" said\nCaptain Finnigan. \"Funny, when you first join the Chaos Legion it\nall seems crazy, and then after a couple of months you realize that\nactually everyone who isn't in the Chaos Legion is crazy\n-\"",
      "\"I said,\" Ron said loudly, \"it sounds like good\nstrategy. We don't Transfigure anything, we don't tire ourselves\nout, we handle whatever they throw at us, and then we just overrun\nthem.\"",
      "\"Okay,\" said Hermione. \"Let's do that.\"",
      "\"But -\" said Anthony, shooting a glare at Ron. \"But General,\nHarry Potter's got sixteen people left in his army. Dragon\nand us each have twenty-eight. Harry knows that, he knows he's got\nto come up with something incredible -\"",
      "\"Like what?\" demanded Hermione, sounding stressed. \"If we don't\nknow what he's planning, we might as well save our magic for doing\nmassed Finites. Like we should've done last\ntime!\"",
      "Susan touched Hermione gently on the shoulder. \"General\nGranger?\" said Susan. \"I think you should take a break for a bit\nbefore the battle.\"",
      "She'd been expecting Hermione to argue, but Hermione just nodded\nand then walked a little faster, pulling away from the Sunshine\nRegiment Official Officer Group, her eyes still watching the\nforest, and sometimes the sky.",
      "Susan followed her. It wouldn't do, having it look like the\nSunshine General was being ejected from her own Official Officer\nGroup.",
      "\"Hermione?\" Susan said softly, after they'd walked a bit away.\n\"You've got to focus. Professor Quirrell's in charge here, not\nSnape, and he won't let anything bad happen to you or anyone.\"",
      "\"You're not helping,\" Hermione said, sounding shaky. \"You're not\nhelping at all, Captain Bones.\"",
      "The two of them walked faster, circling around some of the other\nsoldiers, inspecting the marching perimeter and glancing at the\nsurrounding trees.",
      "\"Susan?\" Hermione said in a small voice, when they'd gotten\nfurther away from all the others. \"Do you think Daphne's right\nabout Draco Malfoy plotting something?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Susan said at once, not even thinking about it. \"You can\ntell, because his name's got the letters M-A-L-F-O and Y in\nit.\"",
      "Hermione looked around, as if to make sure that nobody was\nwatching, although of course that was a wonderful way to get other\npeople to pay attention to you. \"Could Malfoy have been behind what\nSnape did?\"",
      "\"Snape could be behind Malfoy,\" Susan said thoughtfully,\nremembering dinner-table conversations she'd heard at Auntie's, \"or\nLucius Malfoy could be behind both of them.\" A slight chill went\ndown Susan's spine as this last thought occurred to her. Suddenly,\ntelling Hermione to just focus on the coming battle seemed a lot\nless reasonable. \"Why, did you find some sort of clue about\nthat?\"",
      "Hermione shook her head. \"No,\" the Ravenclaw girl said, in a\nvoice that sounded almost like she was about to cry. \"I was - just\nthinking about it myself - that's all.\"",
      "In their designated place in a forest near Hogwarts, the Dragon\nGeneral and the warriors of Dragon Army waited where their red\nflame had led them, beneath grey skies.",
      "At Draco's right side stood Padma Patil, his second-in-command,\nwho had once led all of Dragon Army after Draco had been stunned.\nAt Draco's back was Vincent, the son of Crabbe, a family which had\nserved the Malfoys into the distance of forgotten memory; the\nmuscular boy was watchful as he was always watchful, whether battle\nhad been declared or no. Further back, Gregory of the Goyles stood\nwaiting beside one of the two broomsticks Dragon Army had been\ngiven; if the Goyles had not served the Malfoys so long as the\nCrabbes, yet they had served no less well.",
      "And at Draco's left side, now, stood one Dean Thomas of\nGryffindor, a mudblood or possible half-blood who knew nothing of\nhis father.",
      "Sending Dean Thomas to Dragon Army had been a quite deliberate\nmove on Harry's part, Draco was certain. Three other former\nChaotics had also been transferred to Dragon Army, and all were\nwatching Draco hawklike to see if he offered the former Lieutenant\nthe slightest insult.",
      "Some might have called it sabotage, but Draco knew better. Harry\nhad also sent Lieutenant Finnigan to the Sunshine Regiment, even\nthough Professor Quirrell's mandate had only required that Harry\ngive up one Lieutenant. That too had been a deliberate\nmove, making crystal clear to everyone that Harry wasn't\ndumping his least-favored soldiers.",
      "In one sense, it might have been easier for Draco to win the\ntrue loyalties of his new soldiers if they'd thought Harry hadn't\nwanted them. In another sense... well, it wasn't easy to put into\nwords. Harry had given him good soldiers with their pride intact,\nbut it was more than that. Harry had showed kindliness toward his\nsoldiers, but it was more than that. It wasn't just Harry\nplaying fair, it was something that... that you couldn't help but\ncontrast with the way the game was played in Slytherin House.",
      "So Draco hadn't offered the slightest insult to Mr. Thomas, but\nbrought him straight to his side, subordinate to himself and Padma\nbut no one else. It was a test, Draco had told Mr. Thomas and\neveryone, not a promotion. Mr. Thomas would have to show himself\nworthy of rank within Dragon Army - but he would be given a chance,\nand the chance would be fair. Mr. Thomas had looked\nsurprised at the ceremony of it (the Chaos Legion, from what Draco\nhad heard, didn't stand on formality) but the Gryffindor boy had\nstood a little straighter, and nodded.",
      "And then, after Mr. Thomas had done well enough in one of Dragon\nArmy's training sessions, he'd been brought into the strategy\nsession in Dragon Army's huge military office. And a few minutes\ninto the session, Padma had happened to ask - as though it was a\nperfectly normal question - whether Mr. Thomas had any ideas about\nhow to defeat the Chaos Legion.",
      "The Gryffindor boy had said cheerfully that Harry had predicted\nthat General Malfoy would get one of his soldiers to ask him that,\nand that Harry had given him the message that General Malfoy should\nask himself where his relative advantage lay - what Draco Malfoy\ncould do, or what Dragon Army could do, that the Chaos Legion\ncouldn't match - and then try to exploit it for all it was worth.\nDean Thomas couldn't think of what that advantage might be, but if\nhe did come up with any ideas for beating Chaos, he'd\nshare them. Harry had ordered him to, after all.",
      "Sigh, Draco had thought, since he couldn't actually\nsigh out loud. But it was good advice, and Draco had followed it,\nsitting at his bedroom desk with quill and parchment listing out\neverything that might be a relative advantage.",
      "And, almost to Draco's own surprise, he'd had an idea, a real\none. In fact he'd had two.",
      "The hollow bell sounded through the forest, somehow sounding\nmore ominous than ever before. On the instant, the two pilots cried\n\"Up!\u202f\" and leapt onto their broomsticks, heading into the\ngray sky.",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Davis had now slumped slightly against each other,\nmore from sheer muscle exhaustion than from any decrease of\ntension. Before them, the vast blank white parchment flickered with\nthree great windows, as though holes had been cut through into the\nforest, showing three armies on the march. Lesser windows showed\nthe six riders upon their broomsticks, and the corner of the\nparchment showed a view of the entire forest, with glowing dots to\nindicate armies and scouts.",
      "The window into Sunshine showed General Granger and her Captains\nmarching in the center of the Sunshine Regiment, protected by\nContego screens along with a number of other young\nwitches. The Sunshine Regiment, the Defense Professor had remarked,\nknew well that it had now acquired a strong advantage in\nexperienced soldiers, and it meant to protect those soldiers from a\nsurprise attack. Aside from that, the Sunshine Soldiers were moving\nforward at a steady march, conserving their strength.",
      "The soldiers in General Malfoy's army, at least those with\nhigher Transfiguration scores, were picking up leaves and\nTransfiguring them into... well, if you looked at Padma Patil, who\nwas almost done with hers, it looked like her leaf was becoming a\nleft-handed glove bearing a dangling strap. (The window had zoomed\nin to show this.)",
      "Lord Jugson was watching the screen with a flat expression; his\nvoice, when he spoke, seemed to ooze and drip with disdain. \"What\nis your son doing, Lucius?\"",
      "The foreign-born witch who stood at Draco Malfoy's right side\nhad finished Transfiguring her glove, and was now bringing it\nbefore the Dragon General like a sacrifice.",
      "\"I do not know,\" said Lucius Malfoy, his tone calm though no\nless aristocratic, \"but I must trust that he has good reason for\ndoing it.\"",
      "All Dragon Army stopped for a moment as Padma slid the glove\nover her left hand, strapped it in place, and presented it before\nDraco Malfoy; who also stopped in place, took several deep breaths,\nraised his wand, executed a precise set of eight movements and\nbellowed \"Colloportus!\u202f\"",
      "The Dragon Warrior raised her gloved hand, flexed it, and gave a\nsmall bow to Draco Malfoy, who returned it more shallowly, though\nthe Dragon General was staggering slightly. Padma then returned to\nher place at Draco's side, and the Dragons began marching once\nmore.",
      "\"Well,\" remarked Augusta Longbottom. \"I don't suppose someone\nwould care to explain?\" Amelia Bones was frowning slightly as she\ngazed at the screen.",
      "\"For some reason or other,\" said the amused voice of Professor\nQuirrell, \"it seems that the scion of Malfoy is able to cast\nsurprisingly strong magic for a first-year student. Due to the\npurity of his blood, of course. Certainly the good Lord Malfoy\nwould not have openly flouted the underage magic laws by arranging\nfor his son to receive a wand before his acceptance into\nHogwarts.\"",
      "\"I suggest you be careful in your implications, Quirrell,\"\nLucius Malfoy said coldly.",
      "\"Oh, I am,\" Professor Quirrell said. \"A Colloportus\ncannot be dispelled by Finite Incantatem; it requires an\nAlohomora of equal strength. Until then, a glove so\nCharmed will resist lesser material forces, deflect the Sleep Hex\nand the Stunning Hex. And as neither Mr. Potter nor Miss Granger\ncan cast a counterspell powerful enough, that Charm is invincible\nupon this battlefield. It is not the original intent of the Charm,\nnor the intent of whoever taught Mr. Malfoy an emergency spell for\nevading his enemies. But it would seem that Mr. Malfoy has been\nlearning creativity.\"",
      "Lucius Malfoy had straightened as the Defense Professor spoke;\nhe now sat erect upon his cushioned bench, his head held\nperceptibly higher than before, and when he spoke it was with quiet\npride. \"He will be the greatest Lord Malfoy that has yet\nlived.\"",
      "\"Faint praise,\" Augusta Longbottom said under her breath; Amelia\nBones chuckled, as did Mr. Davis for a tiny, fatal fraction of a\nsecond before he stopped with a strangled gargle.",
      "\"I quite agree,\" said Professor Quirrell, though it wasn't clear\nto whom he spoke. \"Unfortunately for Mr. Malfoy, he is still new to\nthe art of creativity, and so he has committed a classic error of\nRavenclaw.\"",
      "\"And what might that be?\" said Lucius Malfoy, his voice now\nturned chill once more.",
      "Professor Quirrell had leaned back in his seat, the pale blue\neyes briefly unfocusing as one of the windows shifted its viewpoint\nwithin the greater screen, zooming in to show the sweat now on\nDraco Malfoy's forehead. \"It is such a beautiful idea that Mr.\nMalfoy has quite overlooked its pragmatic difficulties.\"",
      "\"Would someone care to explain that?\" said Lady Greengrass. \"Not\nall of us present are experts at such... affairs.\"",
      "Amelia Bones spoke, the old witch's voice somewhat dry. \"It will\ntempt them to try to catch hexes that they would be wiser to simply\ndodge. The more so, if they have had little practice catching them.\nAnd the casting of so many Charms will tire their strongest\nwarrior.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell gave the DMLE Director a half-nod of\nacknowledgment. \"As you say, Madam Bones. Mr. Malfoy is new to the\nbusiness of having ideas, and so when he has one, he becomes proud\nof himself for having it. He has not yet had enough ideas to\nunflinchingly discard those that are beautiful in some aspects and\nimpractical in others; he has not yet acquired confidence in his\nown ability to think of better ideas as he requires them. What we\nare seeing here is not Mr. Malfoy's best idea, I fear, but rather\nhis only idea.\"",
      "Lord Malfoy simply turned to watch the screens again, as though\nthe Defense Professor had used up his right to exist.",
      "\"But -\" said Lord Greengrass. \"But what in Merlin's name is\nHarry Potter -\"",
      "Sixteen remaining soldiers of the Chaos Legion - or fifteen plus\nBlaise Zabini, rather - marched confidently through the forest,\ntheir shoes thudding over the still-dry ground. Their camouflage\nuniforms blended into the forest even more than usual, all colors\nwashed out by the tints of an overcast day.",
      "Sixteen Chaos Legionnaires, against twenty-eight Dragon Warriors\nand twenty-eight Sunshine Soldiers.",
      "The common consensus had been that, with odds that bad, it was\npractically impossible for them to lose. After all, General Chaos\nwas bound to come up with something really spectacular,\nfacing odds like that.",
      "There was something almost nightmarish about how everyone seemed\nto now expect Harry to pull miracles out of his hat, on demand, any\ntime one was needed. It meant that if you couldn't do the\nimpossible, you were disappointing your friends and\nfailing to live up to your potential...",
      "Harry hadn't bothered complaining to Professor Quirrell about\n'too much pressure'. Harry's mental model of the Defense Professor\nhad predicted him looking severely annoyed, saying things along the\nlines of You are perfectly capable of solving this problem, Mr.\nPotter; did you even try? and then deducting several hundred\nQuirrell points.",
      "From above, from where two broomsticks watched their march, the\nhigh young voice of Tess Walsh cried \"Friend!\" and after another\nmoment, \"Gingersnap!\"",
      "A handful of seconds later, the soldier who'd code-named herself\nGingersnap returned bearing a double handful of acorns, sweating\nslightly in the cool but humid air from the jog that had taken her\nto the oak tree Neville had spotted. Gingersnap approached to where\nShannon was holding a uniform-shirt with the neck tied off, in lieu\nof anyone having to Transfigure a bag. When Gingersnap brought her\nhands forward to try and dump her acorns into the holding-shirt,\nChaotic Shannon, giggling, jerked the shirt to the right, then to\nthe left again as Gingersnap made another effort to dump the\nacorns, until a sharp \"Miss Friedman!\" from Lieutenant Nott caused\nShannon to sigh and hold the shirt still. Gingersnap dumped her\nacorns into those accumulated, and then headed out for more.",
      "Somewhere in the background, Ellie Knight was singing her very\nown version of the Chaos Legion's marching song, and around half\nthe other soldiers were trying to step along with it despite not\nknowing the tune in advance. Nearby, Nita Berdine, who had a high\nTransfiguration score, finished creating yet another pair of green\nsunglasses, and handed them to Adam Beringer, who folded up the\nsunglasses before tucking them into his uniform pocket. Other\nsoldiers were already wearing their own green sunglasses, despite\nthe cloudy day.",
      "You might guess that there was some sort of incredibly\ncomplicated and fascinating explanation behind this, and you would\nbe right.",
      "Two days earlier Harry had been sitting amid his bookcases in\nthe comfy rocking-chair he'd obtained for his trunk's cavern level,\npondering silently in the quiet span between classes and\ndinnertime, thinking about power.",
      "For sixteen Chaotics to defeat twenty-eight Sunnies and\ntwenty-eight Dragons they would need a force amplifier. There were\nlimits to what you could do with maneuver. There had to be\na secret weapon and it had to be invincible, or at least moderately\nunstoppable.",
      "Muggle artifacts were now illegal in Hogwarts's mock battles,\nbanned by Ministry edict. And the trouble with finding some other\nclever and unusual spell was that an army twice your own size could\nbrute-force Finite almost anything you tried. The Sunshine\nRegiment might have missed that tactic with the Transfigured\nchainmail, but nobody would miss it again now that Professor\nQuirrell had pointed it out. And Finite Incantatem was a\nbrute-force counterspell which required at least as much magic as\nthe spell being canceled... which, if you were severely\noutnumbered, made it a whole new order of military challenge. The\nenemy could Finite anything you tried, and still have\nenough magic left over for shields and volleys of Sleep Hexes.",
      "Unless, somehow, you could invoke potencies beyond the ordinary\nstrength of first-year Hogwarts students, something too powerful\nfor the enemy to Finite.",
      "So Harry had asked Neville if he'd ever heard of any small,\nsafe sacrificial rituals -",
      "And then, after the screaming and the shouting had subsided,\nafter Harry had stopped trying to argue about Unbreakable Vows and\njust given up the whole thing as impossible from a public relations\nstandpoint, Harry had realized that he hadn't even needed to go\nthere. They taught you how to invoke potencies far beyond your own\nstrength in ordinary Hogwarts classes.",
      "Sometimes, even though you were looking straight at something,\nyou didn't realize what you were looking at until you\nhappened to ask exactly the right question.",
      "Defense. Charms. Transfiguration. Potions. History of Magic.\nAstronomy. Broomstick Flying. Herbology...",
      "\"Foe!\u202f\" screamed the voice from above.",
      "It was a good thing that Neville Longbottom hadn't the tiniest\nidea that his grandmother was watching; or he would've been more\nself-conscious about screaming scary battlecries at the top of his\nlungs while casting Luminos every three seconds as he\nrocketed through a dense forest of trees, hot on the tail of\nGregory Goyle.",
      "(\"But -\" Augusta Longbottom said, her expression showing almost\nas much astonishment as worry. \"But Neville is afraid of\nheights!\")",
      "(\"Not all fears last,\" said Amelia Bones. The old witch was\nfavoring the great screen before them with a measuring gaze. \"Or\nperhaps he has found courage. It is much the same, in the\nend.\")",
      "A glimmer of red -",
      "Neville dodged, very nearly into a tree but he did dodge; and\nthen Neville somehow also managed to dodge almost all of\nthe branches before they smacked him in the face.",
      "Now Mr. Goyle's broomstick was pulling further and further away\n- even though the two of them were riding exactly the same\nbroomstick and Mr. Goyle weighed more, somehow Neville was still\nfalling behind. So Neville slowed down, pulled back, angled up out\nof the forest and began to accelerate back toward where the Chaos\nLegion still marched.",
      "Twenty seconds later - it hadn't been a long chase, just an\nexciting one - Neville was back among his fellow Chaotics,\nand dismounted his broom to walk on the ground for a little\nbit.",
      "\"Neville -\" said General Potter. Harry's voice was a little\ndistant, as he walked carefully and steadily through the forest,\nhis wand still applied to the almost-finished Form of the object he\nwas slowly Transfiguring. Beside him, Blaise Zabini, working a\nsmaller version of the same Transfiguration, looked like a\nshambling Inferi as he stumbled forward. \"I told you - Neville -\nyou don't have to -\"",
      "\"Yes, I do,\" said Neville. He looked down at where his fingers\ngrasped the broomstick, and saw that not just his hands, but his\nwhole arms were shaking. But unless anyone else in Chaos had been\npracticing dueling for an hour a day with Mr. Diggory, and then\npracticing their aim in private for another hour afterward, Neville\nwas probably the best shot from a broomstick even after taking into\naccount that he wasn't a very good flyer.",
      "\"Good show, Neville,\" Theodore said from where he was walking\nahead of them all, leading the Chaos Legion forward through the\nforest while wearing only his undershirt.",
      "(Augusta Longbottom and Charles Nott exchanged brief astonished\nglances and then wrenched their gazes away from one another as\nthough stung.)",
      "Neville took a few deep breaths, trying to steady his hands,\ntrying to think; Harry might not be good for deep strategic\nthinking while he was in the middle of an extended Transfiguration.\n\"Lieutenant Nott, do you have any idea why Dragon Army just did\nthat? They lost a broom -\" The Dragons had started the combat with\na feint to provide a distraction for Mr. Goyle's approach through\nthe forest; Neville hadn't realized there were two brooms\nattacking until almost too late. But the Chaos Legion had\ngotten the other pilot. That was why broomsticks usually\ndidn't attack before armies met, it meant a whole army would\nconcentrate fire on the broomstick. \"And the Dragons didn't even\nget anyone, did they?\"",
      "\"Nope!\" Tracey Davis said proudly. She too was now marching by\nGeneral Potter's side, her wand gripped low and watchful as her\neyes scanned the surrounding forest. \"I threw up a Prismatic Sphere\nlike a split second before Mr. Goyle's hex got Zabini, and the way\nMr. Goyle had his other arm stretched out I think he planned to\nknock down the General, too.\" The Slytherin witch smiled with\nvicious confidence. \"Mr. Goyle tried a Breaking Drill Hex, but\nlearned to his dismay that his weak magic was no match for my\nnewfound dark powers, hahahaha!\"",
      "Some Chaotics laughed with her, but a queasy sensation was\nstarting in Neville's stomach as he realized how close the Chaos\nLegion had come to complete disaster. If Mr. Goyle had managed to\ndisrupt both Transfigurations -",
      "\"Report!\" snapped the Dragon General, doing his best to conceal\nthe fatigue he felt after casting seventeen Locking Charms, with\nmore yet to come.",
      "Beads of sweat now dotted Gregory's forehead. \"The enemy got\nDylan Vaughan,\" Gregory said formally. \"Harry Potter and Blaise\nZabini were each Transfiguring something dark-grey and roundish, I\ndon't think it was finished but it looked like it would be big and\nhollow, sort of cauldron-shaped. Zabini's was smaller than\nPotter's. I couldn't get either of them or disrupt their\nTransfigurations, Tracey Davis blocked me. Neville Longbottom is on\na broomstick and he's still a terrible flyer but his aim is really\ngood.\"",
      "Draco listened, frowning, and then he glanced at Padma and Dean\nThomas, who both shook their own heads, indicating that they also\ncouldn't think of what might be big and grey and shaped like a\ncauldron.",
      "\"Anything else?\" said Draco. If that was it, they'd lost a broom\nfor nothing -",
      "\"The only other weird thing I saw,\" Gregory said, sounding\npuzzled, \"was that some Chaotics were wearing... sort of like\ngoggles?\"",
      "Draco thought about this, not noticing that he'd stopped\nmarching or that all of Dragon Army had automatically stopped with\nhim.",
      "\"Was there anything special about the goggles?\" Draco said.",
      "\"Um...\" Gregory said. \"They were... greenish, maybe?\"",
      "\"Okay,\" said Draco. Again without thinking, he began walking\nonce more and his Dragons followed. \"Here's our new strategy. We're\nonly going to send eleven Dragons against the Chaos Legion, not\nfourteen. That should be enough to beat them, now that we can\nneutralize their special advantage.\" It was a gamble, but you had\nto take gambles sometimes, if you wanted to come in first in a\nthree-way battle.",
      "\"You figured out Chaos's plan, General Malfoy?\" said Mr. Thomas\nwith considerable surprise.",
      "\"What are they doing?\" said Padma.",
      "\"I haven't the faintest idea,\" said Draco, with a smirk of the\nmost refined smugness. \"We'll just do the obvious thing.\"",
      "Harry, having now finished his cauldron, was carefully scooping\nacorns into the container while the scouts searched for a nearby\nsource of water that could be used as a liquid base. They'd come\nacross frequent sinkholes and miniature creeks in the forest\nbefore, so it ought not to take long. Another scout had brought a\nstraight stick that would serve as a stirrer, so Harry didn't have\nto Transfigure one.",
      "Sometimes, even though you were looking straight at something,\nyou didn't realize what you were looking at until you\nhappened to ask exactly the right question...",
      "How can I invoke magical powers that ought to be beyond the\nreach of first-year students?",
      "There was a cautionary tale the Potions Master had told them\n(with much sneers and laughter to make the stupidity seem\nlow-status instead of daring and romantic) about a second-year\nwitch in Beauxbatons who'd stolen some extremely restricted and\nexpensive ingredients, and tried to brew Polyjuiceso she could\nborrow the form of another girl for purposes better left\nunmentioned. Only she'd managed to contaminate the potion with\ncat hairs, and then instead of seeking a healer\nimmediately, the witch had hidden herself in a bathroom, hoping the\neffects would just wear off; and when she'd finally been found, it\nhad been too late to reverse the transformation completely,\ncondemning her to a life of despair as a sort of cat-girl\nhybrid.",
      "Harry hadn't realized what that meant until the instant\nof thinking the right question - but what that implied was that a\nyoung wizard or witch could do things with Potions-Making that they\ncouldn't even come close to doing with Charms. Polyjuice was one of\nthe most potent potions known... but what made Polyjuice a\nN.E.W.T.-level potion, apparently, wasn't the required age before\nyou had enough magical power; it was how difficult the potion was\nto brew precisely and what happened to you if you screwed up.",
      "Nobody in any army had tried brewing any potions up until then.\nBut Professor Quirrell would let you get away with nearly anything,\nif it was something you could also have done in a real war.\nCheating is technique, the Defense Professor had once\nlectured them. Or rather, cheating is what the losers call\ntechnique, and will be worth extra Quirrell points when executed\nsuccessfully. In principle, there was nothing unrealistic\nabout Transfiguring a couple of cauldrons and brewing potions out\nof whatever came to hand, if you had enough time before the armies\nmet.",
      "So Harry had retrieved his copy of Magical Drafts and\nPotions, and begun looking for a safe but useful potion he\ncould brew in the minutes before the battle started - a potion\nwhich would win the battle too fast for counterspells, or produce\nspell effects too strong for first-years to Finite.",
      "Sometimes, even though you were looking straight at something,\nyou didn't realize what you were looking at until you\nhappened to ask exactly the right question...",
      "What potion can I brew using only components gathered from\nan ordinary forest?",
      "Every recipe in Magical Drafts and Potions used at\nleast one ingredient from a magical plant or animal. Which was\nunfortunate, because all the magical plants and animals\nwere in the Forbidden Forest, not the safer and lesser woods where\nbattles were held.",
      "Someone else might have given up at that point.",
      "Harry had turned the pages from one recipe to another, skimming\nfaster and faster in dawning realization, confirming what he had\nalready read and was now seeing for the first time.",
      "Every single Potions recipe seemed to demand at least one\nmagical ingredient, but why should that be true?",
      "Charms required no material components at all; you just said the\nwords and waved your wand. Harry had been thinking about\nPotions-Making as essentially analogous: Instead of your spoken\nsyllables triggering a spell effect for no comprehensible reason,\nyou collected a batch of disgusting ingredients and stirred four\ntimes clockwise, and that arbitrarily triggered a spell effect.",
      "In which case, given that most potions used ordinary components\nlike porcupine quills or stewed slugs, you'd expect to see some\npotions using only ordinary components.",
      "But instead every single recipe in Magical Drafts and\nPotions demanded at least one component from a\nmagical plant or animal - an ingredient like silk from an\nAcromantula or petals from a Venus Fire Trap.",
      "Sometimes, even though you were looking straight at something,\nyou didn't realize what you were looking at until you\nhappened to ask exactly the right question...",
      "If making a potion is like casting a Charm, why don't I fall\nover from exhaustion after brewing a draught as powerful as\nboil-curing?",
      "The Friday before last, Harry's double Potions class had brewed\npotion of boil-curing... although even the most trivial\nhealing Charms, if you tried to cast them with wand and\nincantation, were at least fourth-year spells. And afterward,\nthey'd all felt the way they usually felt after Potions class,\nnamely, not magically exhausted to any discernible\ndegree.",
      "Harry had shut his copy of Magical Drafts and Potions\nwith a snap, and rushed down to the Ravenclaw common room. Harry\nhad found a seventh-year Ravenclaw doing his N.E.W.T. potions\nhomework and paid the older boy a Sickle to borrow Moste\nPotente Potions for five minutes; because Harry hadn't wanted\nto run all the way to the library to find confirmation.",
      "After skimming through five recipes in the seventh-year book,\nHarry had read the sixth recipe, for a potion of fire\nbreathing, which required Ashwinder eggs... and the book\nwarned that the resulting fire could be no hotter than the magical\nfire which had spawned the Ashwinder which had laid the eggs.",
      "Harry had shouted \"Eureka!\u202f\" right in the middle of the\nRavenclaw common room, and been severely rebuked by a nearby\nprefect, who'd thought Mr. Potter was trying to cast a spell.\nNobody in the wizarding world knew or cared about some ancient\nMuggle named Archimedes, nor the ur-physicist's realization that\nthe water displaced from a bathtub would equal the volume of the\nobject entering the bathtub...",
      "Conservation laws. They'd been the critical insight in more\nMuggle discoveries than Harry could easily count. In Muggle\ntechnology you couldn't raise a feather one meter off the ground\nwithout the power coming from somewhere. If you looked at\nmolten lava spilling from a volcano and asked where the heat came\nfrom, a physicist would tell you about radioactive heavy metals in\nthe center of the Earth's molten core. If you asked where the\nenergy to power the radioactivity came from, the physicist would\npoint to an era before the Earth had formed, and a primordial\nsupernova in the early days of the galaxy which had baked atomic\nnuclei heavier than the natural limit, the supernova compressing\nprotons and neutrons into a tight unstable package that yielded\nback some of the supernova's energy when it split. A light bulb was\nfueled by electricity, fueled by a nuclear power plant, fueled by a\nsupernova... You could play the game all the way back to the Big\nBang.",
      "Magic did not appear to work like this, to put it\nmildly. Magic's attitude toward laws like Conservation of Energy\nwas somewhere between a giant extended middle finger, and a shrug\nof total indifference. Aguamenti created water out of\nnothingness, so far as anyone knew; there was no known lake whose\nwater level went down each time. That was a simple fifth-year\nspell, not considered impressive by wizards, because creating a\nmere glass of water didn't seem amazing to them. They didn't have\nthe wacky notion that mass ought to be conserved, or that creating\na gram of mass was somehow equivalent to creating\n90,000,000,000,000 joules of energy. There was an upper-year spell\nHarry had run across whose literal incantation was\n'Arresto Momentum!' and when Harry had asked if the\nmomentum went anywhere else he'd just gotten a puzzled\nlook. Harry had kept an increasingly desperate eye out for\nsome kind of conservation principle in magic, anywhere\nwhatsoever...",
      "...and the whole time it had been right in front of him in every\nPotions class. Potions-Making didn't create magic, it\npreserved magic, that was why every potion needed at least\none magical ingredient. And by following instructions like 'stir\nfour times counterclockwise and once clockwise' - Harry had\nhypothesized - you were doing something like casting a small spell\nthat reshaped the magic in the ingredients. (And unbound the\nphysical form so that ingredients like porcupine quills dissolved\nsmoothly into a drinkable liquid; Harry strongly suspected that a\nMuggle following exactly the same recipe would end up with nothing\nbut a spiny mess.) That was what Potions-Making really\nwas, the art of transforming existing magical essences. So\nyou were a little tired after Potions class, but not much, because\nyou weren't empowering the potions yourself, you were just\nreshaping magic that was already there. And that was why a\nsecond-year witch could brew Polyjuice, or at least get close.",
      "Harry had kept scanning through Moste Potente Potions,\nlooking for something that might disprove his shiny new theory.\nAfter five minutes he'd flipped the older boy another Sickle (over\nhis protests) and kept going.",
      "The potion of giant strength required a Re'em to\ntrample the mashed Dugbogs you stirred into the potion. It was odd,\nHarry had realized after a moment, because crushed Dugbogs weren't\nstrong themselves, they were just... very, very crushed after the\nRe'em got through with them.",
      "Another recipe said to 'touch with forged bronze', i.e., grasp a\nKnut in pliers so you could skim the potion's surface; and if you\ndropped the Knut all the way in, the book warned, the potion would\ninstantly superheat and boil over the cauldron.",
      "Harry had stared at the recipes and their warnings, forming a\nsecond and stranger hypothesis. Of course it wouldn't be as simple\nas Potions-Making using magical potentials imbued in the\ningredients, like Muggle cars fueled by the combustion potential of\ngasoline. Magic would never be as sensible as that...",
      "And then Harry had gone to Professor Flitwick - since he didn't\nwant to approach Professor Snape outside of class - and Harry had\ntold Professor Flitwick that he wanted to invent a new potion, and\nhe knew what the ingredients ought to be and what the potion should\ndo, but he didn't know how to deduce the required stirring pattern\n-",
      "After Professor Flitwick had stopped screaming in horror and\nrunning in little circles, and Professor McGonagall had been called\ninto the ensuing fierce interrogation to promise Harry that in this\ncase it was both acceptable and important for him to reveal his\nunderlying theory, it had developed that Harry had not made an\noriginal magical discovery, but rediscovered a law so ancient that\nnobody knew who had first formulated it:",
      "A potion spends that which is invested in the creation of\nits ingredients.",
      "The heat of goblin forges that had cast the bronze Knut, the\nRe'em's strength that had crushed the Dugbogs, the magical fire\nthat had spawned the Ashwinder: all these potencies could be\nrecalled, unlocked, and restructured by the spell-like process of\nstirring the ingredients in exact patterns.",
      "(From a Muggle standpoint it was just odd, a deranged\nversion of thermodynamics invented by someone who thought life\nought to be fair. From a Muggle standpoint, the heat\nexpended in forging the Knut hadn't gone into the bronze, the heat\nhad left and dissipated into the environment, becoming permanently\nless available. Energy was conserved, could be neither created nor\ndestroyed; entropy always increased. But wizards didn't\nthink that way: from their perspective, if you'd put some amount of\nwork into making a Knut, it stood to reason that you could get\nexactly the same work back out. Harry had tried to explain why this\nsounded a bit odd if you'd been raised by Muggles, and Professor\nMcGonagall had asked bemusedly why the Muggle perspective was any\nbetter than the wizarding one.)",
      "The fundamental principle of Potions-Making had no name and no\nstandard phrasing, since then you might be tempted to write it\ndown.",
      "And someone who wasn't wise enough to figure out the principle\nthemselves might read it.",
      "And they would start having all sorts of bright ideas for\ninventing new Potions.",
      "And then they would be turned into catgirls.",
      "It had been made very clear to Harry that he wasn't going to be\nsharing this particular discovery with Neville, or Hermione either\nafter the next armies' battle. Harry had tried to say something\nabout Hermione seeming really off lately and this being just the\nsort of thing that might cheer her up. Professor McGonagall had\nsaid flatly that he wasn't even to think it, and Professor Flitwick\nhad raised his little hands and made a gesture as of snapping a\nwand in half.",
      "Although the two Professors had been kind enough to suggest that\nif Mr. Potter thought he knew what the potion's ingredients should\nbe, he might be able to find an already-existing recipe that did\nthe same thing; and Professor Flitwick had mentioned several\nvolumes in the Hogwarts library that might be useful...",
      "The vast parchment-like screen now showed only an aerial view of\nthe forest, from which you could barely make out the camouflaged\nforms of three armies, split up into two groups each, converging to\nfight their three-way battle.",
      "The benches of the Quidditch stadium were now rapidly filling up\nwith the more easily bored sort of spectator who only wanted to be\nthere for the final battle and skip out on all the boring points\nalong the way. (If there was anything wrong with Professor\nQuirrell's battles, it was widely agreed, it was that his\nspectacles didn't last nearly as long as Quidditch matches, once\nthey actually started. To this Professor Quirrell had replied only,\nSuch is realism, and that had been that.)",
      "Within the huge window - it was all one window now, observing\nfrom a great height - the vague collections of tiny camouflaged\nforms grew closer.",
      "Closer.",
      "Almost touching -",
      "The vast white parchment window showed the first touch of battle\nbetween Sunshine and Chaos, a screaming mass of running children\nwith smiley-faces upon their breasts, charging forward with\nContego shields held high and others shouting\n\"Somnium!\u202f\" -",
      "Until one of their number shrieked \"Prismatis!\u202f\" in a\nterrified voice and the entire charge came to a sudden halt before\nthe sparkling wall of force that had appeared in front of them.",
      "Tracey Davis had walked out from behind the trees.",
      "\"That's right,\" said Tracey, her voice low and grim as she\nleveled her wand on the barrier. \"You should fear me. For I am\nTracey Davis, the Darke Lady! That's Darke Lady spelled D-A-R-K-E,\nwith an E!\"",
      "(Amelia Bones, Director of the Department of Magical Law\nEnforcement, was sending an inquiring look at Mr. and Mrs. Davis,\nboth of whom looked like they would have dearly preferred to die on\nthe spot.)",
      "Behind the Prismatic Barrier, there was some kind of hushed\nargument taking place among the Sunshine Soldiers, one of whom in\nparticular seemed to be getting scolded by several of the\nothers.",
      "Then, a moment later, Tracey flinched.",

      "Tracey yelled, her voice high with strain,\n\"Inflammare!\u202f\" and the Sunshine charge came to another\nsudden halt as a line of fire blazed up between them in the\nhalf-dry grass, extending to follow the path of Tracey's wand as\nshe pointed it; an instant later Susan Bones cried \"Finite\nIncantatem!\u202f\" and the flames dimmed, brightened, dimmed in the\ncontest of their wills, other soldiers raising their wards to aim\nat Tracey; and that was when Neville Longbottom plunged\nshrieking out of the sky.",
      "One of the Dragon Warriors, Raymond Arnold, made a hand-sign,\npointing forward and oblique left; and there was a sudden hushed\nhiss of whispers among the Dragon Army contingent as they all\nquietly reoriented themselves in the direction of the enemy. The\nSunnies knew they were there, of course both armies knew; but\nsomehow, in this moment, they had all become instinctively\nquiet.",
      "The Dragons crept forward further, and then further, the dull\ncamouflaged forms of the Sunnies beginning to appear among the\ndistant trees, and still nobody spoke, nobody bellowed the call to\ncharge.",

      "Across the forest battleground, their eyes met.",
      "Draco had only a fraction of a second to wonder, in the back of\nhis mind, what Hermione Granger was so angry about, before the\nshout went up from both their armies; and they were all running\nforward to the charge.",
      "The other Chaotics had appeared now from among the trees, some\nhad dropped out of trees, and the battle was in full force\nnow, everyone firing in every direction at anything that looked\nlike an enemy. Plus a number of Sunnies crying \"Luminos!\u202f\"\nat Neville Longbottom as the Chaos Hufflepuff twisted and rocketed\nup through the air on courses that could only be described as,\nindeed, \"chaotic\" -",
      "And it happened, the way it happened only one time out of twenty\nin mock aerial combat, that Neville Longbottom's broomstick glowed\nbright red beneath his clenched hands.",
      "It should've meant that Longbottom was out of the game.",
      "Then, in the Hogwarts stands, among the watching crowds of\nstudents, a scream went up -",

      "Neville was falling toward the ground and screaming \"Chaotic\nlanding!\u202f\" and the Chaotics were wrenching their attention\naway from fights to cast the Hover Charm (and run at the same time\nso they wouldn't be sitting ducks), almost everyone else stopping\nto gape -",
      "And Neville Longbottom slammed into the leaf-laden forest\nground, landing on one knee, one foot, and both hands, as though he\nwere kneeling down to be knighted.",
      "Everything stopped. Even Tracey and Susan paused in their\nduel.",
      "In the stadium, all crowd noises vanished.",
      "There was a universal silence composed of astonishment, concern,\nand sheer dumbstruck gaping awe, as everyone waited to see what\nwould happen next.",
      "And then Neville Longbottom slowly rose to his feet, and leveled\nhis wand at the Sunshine Soldiers.",
      "Though nobody on the battlefield heard it, a large segment of\nthe stadium audience had begun chanting, in steadily rising notes\neach time the word was uttered, \"DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM\", because\nyou just couldn't see that and not think it required\nmusical accompaniment.",
      "\"The crowd is cheering your grandson,\" said Amelia Bones. The\nold witch was favoring the screen with a measuring look.",
      "\"So they are,\" said Augusta Longbottom. \"Some, if I hear\ncorrectly, are cheering, Our blood for Neville! Our souls for\nNeville!\u202f\"",
      "\"Quite,\" said Amelia, taking a sip from a teacup which had not\nbeen there moments earlier. \"It shows the lad has leadership\npotential.\"",
      "\"These cheers,\" continued Augusta, her voice taking on an even\nmore stunned quality, \"seem to be coming from the Hufflepuff\nbenches.\"",
      "\"It is the House of the loyal, my dear,\" said Amelia.",
      "\"Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore! What in Merlin's\nname has been happening in this school?\u202f\"",
      "Lucius Malfoy was watching the screens with an ironic smile, his\nfingers tapping at his armrest in no discernible pattern. \"I do not\nknow what is more frightening, the thought that he has some hidden\nplan behind all this, or the thought that he does not.\"",
      "\"Look!\" cried the Lord of Greengrass. The dapper young man had\nrisen half out of his chair, pointing his finger at the screen.\n\"There she goes!\"",
      "\"We'll both take him at once,\" Daphne whispered. She knew that a\nfew fear-filled minutes of real combat experience, a handful of\ntimes each week, might not be enough to match Neville's regular\ndueling practice with Harry and Cedric Diggory over the same\nperiod. \"He's too much for one of us, but both of us together -\nI'll use my Charm, you just try to stun him -\"",
      "Hannah, beside her, nodded, and then they both screamed at the\ntop of their lungs and charged forward, the Hover Charms of two\nsupporting Sunshine Soldiers moving them faster and making them\nlight on their feet, Daphne already crying \"Tonare!\u202f\" even\nas Hannah kept a huge Contego shield moving in front of\nthem, and with a brief extra lift they leapt over the heads of the\nfront screen of soldiers and landed in front of Neville with their\nhair billowing high around them -",
      "(Photographs were strictly prohibited at all Hogwarts games, but\nsomehow this moment still ended up on the front page of\nthe next day's Quibbler.)",
      "- and in the same instant, because fighting older bullies had\nburned away the slightest traces of hesitation, Hannah fired her\nfirst Sleep Hex at Neville (she'd started the incantation while she\nwas still in the air) even as Daphne, concentrating more on speed\nthan on force, slashed down with her Ancient Blade at where she\nthought Neville's thighs would be after he dodged -",
      "But Neville leapt up, not sideways, leapt up higher than he\nshould've been able to go, so that her glowing sword cut only the\nair beneath his feet. Somehow Daphne realized what it meant, that\nNeville still had other Chaotics Hovering him, in time for her to\nraise her Blade up over her head, but Neville fell too\nfast and when his Blade smashed into hers it was like being\nhit by a Bludger. It knocked Daphne off her feet and sent her\nsprawling backward onto the grass, hitting the ground hard on her\nback. It might have been all over for her, then, if Neville hadn't\nlanded too hard himself and gone to his knees with a pained gasp.\nAnd then before Neville could bring his glowing Blade down, Hannah\nshouted \"Somnium!\u202f\" and Neville lurched frantically\nbackward - though of course no spell had actually come from\nHannah's wand, the Hufflepuff girl couldn't really have fired again\nthat fast - which gave Daphne a second to scramble to her feet and\nget both hands around her wand again -",
      "\"Dear Merlin,\" said Lady Greengrass. Her voice seemed unsteady,\nthe aristocratic poise well-punctured. \"My daughter is fighting\nwith the Charm of the Most Ancient Blade. In her first year. I\nnever knew she possessed - such extraordinary talent -\"",
      "\"Excellent blood,\" Charles Nott said approvingly, causing\nAugusta to snort.",
      "\"My good Lady,\" said Professor Quirrell, sounding grave. \"Do not\nwrong your daughter so. That is not mere talent which you see.\" His\nvoice grew a little dryer. \"Rather, it is what happens when\nchildren put their competitive efforts into a game which involves\nactual spellcasting.\"",
      "\"Expelliarmus!\u202f\" shouted Draco, trying not to let his\nvoice crack as he simultaneously dodged the blazing red stunbolt\nthat Hermione Granger had fired at him, his muscles twisting with\nthe need to dodge in the wrong direction - she'd pointed to his\nleft, and then with a mysterious twitch fired right -",
      "Hermione dodged the fast-moving dueling hex, and cried with\nhardly another moment's pause, \"Steleus!\u202f\", a wide-angle\nHex that Draco couldn't avoid, but he managed to point his wand at\nhis own face and cry \"Quiescus!\u202f\" before the sudden urge\nto inhale could devolve into a sneezing fit that would've ended the\nbattle.",
      "Draco Malfoy was already half-exhausted from all the Locking\nCharms and Transfigurations earlier, but his confusion was\nbeginning to give way to a sense of his own blood boiling, he\ndidn't know why Granger was attacking him so angrily all of a\nsudden, but if she wanted a fight he'd give her one -",
      "(The Dragons and Sunnies weren't stopping to watch the duel of\ntheir Generals, the Dragons were too disciplined to stop and watch\nand that meant the Sunnies had to go on fighting too; but the\ngaping audience in the Hogwarts Quidditch stands were being\ndistracted even from Neville and Daphne's spectacle, shifting their\neyes to the duel of two Generals as Malfoy and Granger fired hex\nafter hex and jinx after jinx at each other, casting more rapidly\nthan any other student in their year could have managed, the Dragon\nGeneral's trained dueling dance matched by the Sunshine General's\nfrantic energy, the combat between them beginning to resemble an\nadult duel as the two most magically powerful first-years resorted\nto spells more exotic than the usual Sleep Hex.)",
      "- although, Draco was beginning to realize, when he and Harry\nand Professor Quirrell had dismissed Miss Granger as having as much\nintent to kill as a bowl of wet grapes, they'd never seen her\nangry.",
      "Daphne lashed out with her Ancient Blade, again not trying to\nhit hard but just moving the Blade as fast as possible, at the same\ntime Hannah cried \"Somnium!\u202f\" and Neville leapt back\nagain, but it had been another bluff and Hannah was moving in to\nfire a real spell almost point-blank -",
      "- and Neville Longbottom did exactly what - he would explain\nafterward - Cedric Diggory had trained him to do if he was fighting\nBellatrix Black, which was to spin around and kick Hannah\nreally hard in the pit of her stomach.",
      "The Hufflepuff girl made a sad little sound, a gasping cry of\npain, as she was knocked off her feet by the hard shoe sinking into\nher abdomen with the force of Neville's whole body behind it.",
      "For an instant the battlefield stood still, everything halted\nexcept Hannah's falling form.",
      "Then Neville's face turned to absolute dismay and he lowered his\nwand, the Chaotic Lieutenant starting instinctively toward his\nHouse-mate as he reached for her with his other hand -",
      "Even as Hannah turned her fall into a roll and came out with her\nwand raised and shot him.",
      "A fractional second later, Daphne, who hadn't hesitated either,\nsank her Most Ancient Blade squarely into Neville's back, causing\nthe Chaotic Lieutenant's muscles to jerk convulsively with the\nstunning magic discharging into him even as Hannah's Sleep Hex took\neffect, and then the last scion of Longbottom was sprawled still on\nthe ground with a look of total surprise frozen to his face.",
      "\"Today Mr. Longbottom has learned a valuable lesson about his\nfeelings of pity and remorse,\" said Professor Quirrell.",
      "\"And chivalry,\" said Amelia, sipping her tea again.",
      "\"Are you all right?\" whispered Daphne, as she stood protectively\nover where Hannah lay on the ground clutching her stomach. The girl\ndidn't give anything back in reply except more retching sounds that\nsounded like Hannah was trying not to throw up while trying not to\ncry.",
      "Somehow, even though it might not have been good tactics - it\nwould've been better if Hannah had been hexed outright, than for\nother soldiers to be tied up protecting her - a number of Sunnies\nseemed to be standing in front of Hannah with their wands clutched\ntightly, staring angrily at the Chaotics. Someone had thrown up a\nPrismatic barrier between the two groups, Daphne couldn't see\nwho.",
      "And for some reason the Chaotics didn't seem to be pressing the\nattack. Even Tracey had completely dropped the grim look on her\nface and was shifting her weight nervously from one foot to\nanother, as though she was having trouble remembering which side\nshe was on -",
      "\"Hold!\u202f\" shouted a voice. \"Hold battle!\u202f\"",
      "There wasn't much battle going on anyway, but it held.",
      "General Potter, looking every inch the Boy-Who-Lived, strode out\nfrom the trees with something large and camouflage-cloth-covered\nheld under one arm.",
      "\"Is Miss Abbott breathing all right?\" General Potter yelled.",
      "Daphne didn't look back. She didn't trust that this wasn't a\ntrap - it was absolutely certain that if the Chaotics took the\nopportunity to attack, Professor Quirrell would not only rule it\nlegal but also award them extra points afterward. But Daphne could\nhear the answer well enough with her ears, it wasn't like Hannah\nwas trying to breathe quietly, and so she said, \"Sort\nof.\"",
      "\"She should get out of here and to someone who can use healing\nCharms,\" Harry said. \"Just in case that broke something.\"",
      "From behind Daphne, a small gasping voice said, \"I - can - still\n- fight -\"",
      "\"Miss Abbott, don't -\" Harry said, just as there was the sound\nfrom behind Daphne of someone collapsing back to the grass after\ntrying and failing to get to her feet. Everyone winced, but Daphne\ndidn't turn her back on Harry.",
      "\"Why haven't the teachers stopped the battle?\" said Susan, her\nvoice angry.",
      "\"I expect it's because Miss Abbott is in no danger of permanent\ndamage and Professor Quirrell thinks we're learning valuable\nlessons,\" Harry said in a hard voice. \"Look, Miss Abbott, if you\ngo, Tracey will also retire from the battle. You already outnumber\nus, so that's a very good deal for your side. Please take it.\"",
      "\"Hannah, just go!\" said Daphne. \"I mean, just say you're\nout!\"",
      "When Daphne glanced back she saw that Hannah was shaking her\nhead, still curled up in a ball on the grass.",
      "\"Oh, screw this,\" said Harry. \"Chaotics! The faster we stun\nthem, the faster she's out of here! We're going to do this very\nquickly, even if we take casualties! End truce!\nTUNAFISH!\u202f\"",
      "Daphne's political hindbrain had only an instant to admire how\nHarry's few words had just made the Chaotics the good\nguys, and then in almost perfect unison, the Chaotics were plunging\ntheir hands into the pockets of their uniforms and drawing out\ngreen sunglasses in an unfamiliar style. Not like anything you\nwould wear to the beach, more like goggles for advanced Potions\n-",
      "Then Daphne realized what was about to happen and snapped up her\nother hand to shield her eyes, just as Harry ripped the cloth off\nthe cauldron.",
      "The fluid that spilled forth as Harry Potter threw the\ncauldron's contents into the air was too bright to be seen, too\nbrilliant to be imagined, incandescent like the Sun magnified a\ndozen times -",
      "(which was exactly what it was)",
      "(the sunlight which had been invested to create the acorns, the\nbright energy that had fueled a tree rising up from the bare\ndirt)",
      "(blazing a searing purple, the color of the mixed blue and red\nwavelengths that chlorophyll absorbed)",
      "(with almost none of the green wavelengths that chlorophyll\nreflected to create the green color of leaves)",
      "(which was the color of the Chaos Legion's sunglasses, made to\npass through green wavelengths, blocking red and blue, reducing\neven the most incandescent purple glare to something bearable)",
      "- the violet light blazed on and on, Daphne tried dropping her\narm from her eyes but found that she couldn't look directly at\nanything, even the secondhand purple glare was so bright she had to\nsquint; and she had only time to cry one Finite\nIncantatem, which didn't work, before a Sleep Hex took\nher.",
      "What was left of the battle didn't take very long after\nthat.",
      "\"NOW!\" bellowed Blaise Zabini, formerly of Sunshine, now\ncommanding a detachment of Chaos Legionnaires. \"I mean, TUNAFISH!\"\nThe Slytherin boy's hand grasped the cloth shielding the cauldron\nfrom the triggering touch of daylight, already beginning to move it\naside.",
      "\"NOW!\" bellowed Dean Thomas, formerly of Chaos, commanding a\nconsignment of Dragon Warriors. \"DO WHATEVER THEY DO!\"",
      "The Chaotics of Zabini's detachment plunged their hands into\ntheir uniform pockets, and came forth bearing green sunglasses\n-",
      "- an action almost perfectly mirrored by Dean and the Dragon\nWarriors, who drew forth green-colored Potions goggles, and quickly\ndrew the straps over their own heads, even as the Chaotics put on\ntheir sunglasses and the violet incandescence blasted forth.",
      "(As General Malfoy had explained, if Mr. Goyle reported that the\nChaos Legion was wearing green-colored Potions goggles, you didn't\nhave to know why to Transfigure some copies.)",
      "\"THAT'S CHEATING!\" shrieked Blaise Zabini.",
      "\"THAT'S TECHNIQUE!\" Dean yelled back. \"DRAGONS, CHARGE!\"",
      "(\"Pardon me,\" the Lady Greengrass said. \"Could you stop laughing\nlike that, Mr. Quirrell? It's unnerving.\")",
      "\"FINITE THEIR GOGGLES!\" shouted Blaise Zabini, as the two armies\nran headlong toward each other through omnipresent eye-searing\npurple glare. \"WE CAN STILL WIN!\"",
      "\"YOU HEARD HIM!\" bellowed Dean. \"GET THEIR GLASSES!\"",
      "Blaise Zabini's reply to this wasn't anything articulate.",
      "That battle went on a lot longer.",
      "\"Stupefy!\u202f\" shrieked the Sunshine General.",
      "Draco didn't dodge, he didn't counter, he didn't have enough\nenergy left for either, all he could do was whip his left hand into\nposition and hope -",
      "The red stunbolt dissipated again on Draco's\nColloportused glove, which he'd Transfigured and\nspell-locked to his hand the same as the rest of Dragon Army. It\nwas all that was saving him now, that shield.",
      "It should have been a time to counterattack, but Draco could\nonly catch his breath, as the two of them danced backward and\nforward beneath the trees in the never-ending movements of their\nduel. Across from him, General Granger was panting hard, the young\ngirl's face glistening with sweat like dew, her chestnut hair\nwetted into brown plaits. Her camouflage uniform was stained with\ndamp spots, her shoulders visibly trembling with exhaustion, but\nher wand was still steel-steady where it stayed level on Draco\nthrough all their motion. Her eyes glaring, her cheeks flushed with\nrage.",
      "So, little girl, why're you pretending to fight like a\ngrownup today?",
      "The taunt came to mind, but he didn't really think he needed\nGranger any angrier; so instead Draco just said - though he could\nhear his own voice cracking - \"Any reason you're feeling mad at me,\nGranger?\"",
      "The girl was gasping for breath herself, her own voice wobbling\nas she spoke. \"I know what you're up to,\" said Hermione Granger,\nher voice rising. \"I know what you and Snape are up to, Malfoy, and\nI know who's behind it!\"",
      "\"Huh?\" Draco said without even thinking about it.",
      "That only seemed to increase Granger's fury, and her fingers\nwhitened on the wand she held leveled on him.",
      "And then Draco got it, and it boiled his own blood in his veins.\nEven she thought he was secretly plotting against her\n-",
      "\"You too?\u202f\" Draco yelled. \"I helped you, you\nbucktoothed bint! You, you, you,\" - stuttering past all the\nDark curses that came to mind until he found something he could\nactually cast at her - \"DENSAUGEO!\u202f\"",
      "But Granger flashed and whirled around the Tooth-Lengthening\nHex, and then her own wand came around and leveled at almost\npoint-blank range, even as Draco brought up his left hand like a\nshield, placing the magic-locked glove between himself and whatever\nshe was about to fire, and the Sunshine General's own voice rose to\na shriek audible across the whole battleground -",
      "\"ALOHOMORA!\u202f\"",
      "Time should have paused.",
      "But it didn't.",
      "Instead the padlock clicked and fell off the glove.",
      "Just like that.",
      "Just like that.",
      "The screens showed it all very clearly, to the entire watching\nHogwarts stadium.",
      "And the bone-dead-silent hush that fell over every bench in\nevery bleacher said that everyone understood quite clearly what it\nmeant, that the scion of House Malfoy had just had his magic\novercome by a Muggleborn.",
      "Hermione Granger didn't pause in her fight, gave no sign that\nshe even knew what she'd done; instead her foot snapped out in a\nMuggle-style kick that knocked Draco's wand cleanly out of his\nhand, his shocked mind and body moving just a little too slowly.\nDraco dove after his wand, scrabbling frantically on the ground,\nbut from behind him a girl's cracking voice said\n\"Somnium!\u202f\" and Draco Malfoy fell and didn't rise\nagain.",
      "There was another moment of frozen silence. The Sunshine General\nwas wobbling on her feet, looking like she might faint.",
      "Then the Dragon Warriors screamed at the top of their lungs and\ncharged forward to avenge their fallen commander.",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Davis were shaking as they stood up from the\ncomfortable chairs of the faculty Quidditch box; they couldn't\nquite clutch each other while walking, but they held hands tightly,\npretending hard to be invisible. If they'd been children young\nenough for accidental magic they probably would've spontaneously\nDisillusioned themselves.",
      "The elderly Charles Nott said nothing as he stood from his\nchair. The scarred Lord Jugson said nothing, as he stood from his\nown chair.",
      "Lucius Malfoy said nothing as he stood.",
      "All three of them turned without pause and strode toward the\nstairwell of the elevated bleachers, moving in eerie unison like an\nAuror trio -",
      "\"Lord Malfoy,\" the Defense Professor said in mild tones. That\nman was still seated in his own chair, looking upon his\nparchment-like screens, arms limp at his side, as though for some\nreason he didn't feel like moving.",
      "The white-haired man halted just before reaching the exit\narchway, and the elderly man and the scarred man halted as well,\nflanking him. Lord Malfoy's head turned, too slightly to be any\nform of acknowledgement, but in the Defense Professor's\ndirection.",
      "\"Your son performed exceptionally well today,\" said Professor\nQuirrell. \"I must confess that I underestimated him. And he has\nearned his army's loyalty, as you have witnessed.\" Still very mild,\nthe Defense Professor's voice. \"Speaking as your son's teacher, it\nis my opinion that he will not benefit if you interfere in his\n-\"",
      "Lord Malfoy and his compatriots vanished down the stairs.",
      "\"A fine try, Quirinus,\" Dumbledore said quietly. The old\nwizard's face showed small lines of worry; he hadn't risen from his\nown seat either, staring at the parchment screens as though they\nwere still active. \"Do you think he will listen?\"",
      "The Defense Professor's shoulders twitched in a slight shrug,\nthe only movement they'd shown since the battle ended.",
      "\"Well,\" said the Lady Greengrass, as she rose up and\ncracked her knuckles, stretching, her husband silent beside her. \"I\nmust say, that was quite... interesting...\"",
      "Amelia Bones had risen from her own cushioned seat without any\nfuss. \"Interesting indeed,\" said Director Bones. \"I do confess, I\nfind myself disturbed by the skill with which those children were\nfighting one another.\"",
      "\"The skill?\" Lord Greengrass said. \"Their spells didn't seem all\nthat impressive to me. Except for Daphne's, of course.\"",
      "The old witch did not move her eyes from where she was gazing at\nthe Defense Professor's balding head. \"The Stunning Hex is not a\nfirst-year spell, Lord Greengrass, but that is not the skill I had\nin mind. They supported each other with those simple spells, they\nreacted at speed to surprises...\" The Director of the DMLE paused,\nas though searching for words that a mere civilian could\nunderstand. \"In the midst of battle,\" she said finally, \"with\nspells flying in every direction... those children seemed quite at\nhome.\"",
      "\"Indeed, Director Bones,\" said the Defense Professor. \"Some arts\nare best begun in youth.\"",
      "The old witch's eyes narrowed. \"You are readying them to become\na military force, Professor. To what end?\"",
      "\"Now hold on!\" interjected Lord Greengrass. \"There's plenty of\nschools where they teach dueling in first year!\"",
      "\"Dueling?\" said the Defense Professor. From behind it wasn't\nvisible if the pale face was smiling. \"That is nothing, Lord\nGreengrass, to what my students have learned. They have learned not\nto hesitate in the face of ambushes and greater foes. They have\nlearned to adapt when combat conditions change and change again.\nThey have learned to protect their allies, to protect more those\nwho are more valuable, to abandon pieces which cannot be rescued.\nThey have learned that to survive they must follow orders. Some\nhave even learned a little creativity. Oh, no, Lord Greengrass,\nthese wizards will not hide in their manors and wait to be\nprotected, when the next threat comes. They will know that they\nknow how to fight.\"",
      "Augusta Longbottom loudly clapped her hands together three\ntimes.",
      "We won.",
      "It was the first thing Draco heard when he woke up on the\nbattlefield, Padma telling him how his soldiers had rallied after\nhe fell. How, thanks to the Dragon General's foresight, Mr. Thomas\nhad led his detachment to victory over Chaos. How General Potter\nhad defeated the portion of the Sunshine Regiment that clashed with\nhim. How Mr. Thomas's Dragon Warriors had rejoined the main body of\nsoldiers bearing both their own goggles and the sunglasses of the\ndefeated Chaotics. How, only moments later, General Potter's\nremaining contingent had attacked both other armies with a potion\nthat emitted searing purple light. But Dragon had held the\nnumerical advantage over Sunshine and Chaos both, and enough\nsunglasses for their warriors; and so Padma had managed to lead her\ninherited army to victory.",
      "From the light in Padma's eyes and her arrogant smile that would\nhave done proud to a Malfoy, she was expecting congratulations.\nDraco managed to grit out some form of praise from between his\nclenched teeth, and couldn't have said afterward what it was. The\nforeign-born witch, it appeared, hadn't any idea what'd happened,\nor what it meant.",
      "I lost.",
      "The Dragons trudged back to Hogwarts beneath gray skies, cold\ndroplets landing heavy on Draco's skin, one by one. While he'd been\nstunned, it had begun, the long-promised rain finally beginning to\nfall. There was only one option left to Draco now. A forced move,\nas Mr. MacNair, who'd taught Draco chess, would have termed it.\nHarry Potter probably wouldn't like it, if he really was in love\nwith Granger the way everyone said. But the forced move, as Mr.\nMacNair had defined it, was one you needed to make if you wanted\nthe game to continue at all.",
      "It kept on playing in Draco's mind, over and over again, even as\nhe walked like an automaton through the massive portals of\nHogwarts, sent away Vincent and Gregory with two sharp words, and\nbecame alone within his private bedroom, sitting on his bed,\nstaring at the wall above his desk. Filling his mind like a\nDementor had locked him into the memory.",
      "The padlock on his glove clicking and falling away -",
      "Draco knew, he knew what he'd done wrong. He'd been so\ntired after casting twenty-seven Locking Charms for all the other\nDragon Warriors. Less than a minute wasn't enough time to recover\nafter each spell. And so he'd just cast\nColloportus on his own padlocked glove, just cast\nthe spell, not put in all his strength to bind it stronger than\nHarry Potter or Hermione Granger could undo.",
      "But nobody was going to believe that, even if it was true. Even\nin Slytherin, nobody would believe that. It sounded like an excuse,\nand an excuse was all that anyone would hear.",
      "Granger whirled and spun and screamed 'ALOHOMORA!'\n-",
      "Draco's mind kept playing it over and over as the resentment\nbuilt. He'd helped Granger - cooperated with her on banning\ntraitors - held her hand as she'd dangled off the roof - stopped a\nriot from breaking out around her in the Great Hall - did she have\nany idea what he'd risked, what he'd probably already\nlost, what it meant for the heir of House Malfoy to do\nthat for a mudblood -",
      "And now there was only one move left, and the thing about a\nforced move was that you had to make it, even if it meant\ngetting detention and losing House points. Professor Snape would\nknow and understand, but there were limits (Father had warned him)\nto what the Potions Master would overlook.",
      "Challenge Granger to a wizard's duel, in open defiance of\nHogwarts regulations. Attack her outright, if she tried to refuse.\nDefeat her one-on-one, in public, not with clever dueling\ntechnique, but by overpowering her magic. Beat her\nsolidly, completely, crush her as utterly as the Dark Lord himself\nhad crushed his enemies. Make it absolutely clear to everyone, so\nthat nobody could possibly doubt, that Draco had just been\nexhausted from casting the spell so many times. Prove that the\nMalfoy blood was stronger than any mudblood's -",
      "Only it's not, Harry Potter's voice whispered inside\nDraco's mind. It's easy to forget what's really true, Draco,\nonce you start trying to win at politics. But in reality there's\nonly one thing that makes you a wizard, remember?",
      "Draco knew, then, he knew the reason for the disquiet in the\nback of his mind, as he stared at the blank wall above his desk\ncontemplating his forced move. It should've been simple - when you\nonly had one move, the thing to do was make it - but -",
      "Granger whirling, spinning, sweat-dampened hair flying\naround her, bolts flying from her wand as fast as his own, jinx and\ncounter-jinx, glowing bats flying at his face, and through all of\nit the look of fury in Granger's eyes -",
      "There'd been a part of him admiring that, before it had all gone\nwrong, admiring Granger's fury and power; a part of him that had\nexulted in the first real fight he'd ever been in, against...",
      "...an equal opponent.",
      "If he challenged Granger, and lost...",
      "It ought not to be possible, Draco had gotten his wand two full\nyears before anyone else in his Hogwarts class.",
      "Only there was a reason why they usually didn't bother giving\nwands to nine-year-olds. Age counted too, it wasn't just how long\nyou'd held a wand. Granger's birthday had been only a few days into\nthe year, when Harry had bought her that pouch. That meant she was\ntwelve now, that she'd been twelve almost since the start of\nHogwarts. And the truth was, Draco hadn't been practicing much\noutside of class, probably not nearly as much as Hermione Granger\nof Ravenclaw. Draco hadn't thought he needed any more practice to\nstay ahead...",
      "And Granger was exhausted too, whispered the Voice of\nContrary Evidence inside him. Granger must have been exhausted from\nall those Stunning Hexes, and even in that state she'd been able to\nundo his Locking Charm.",
      "And Draco could not afford to challenge Granger\npublicly, one-on-one with no excuses, and lose.",
      "Draco knew what you were supposed to do in this sort of\nsituation. You were supposed to cheat. But if anyone discovered\nDraco cheating, it would be disastrous, perfect blackmail material\neven if it never got out publicly, and any Slytherins watching\nwould know that, they'd be looking...",
      "And then, if you were watching, you would have seen Draco Malfoy\nget up from his bed, and go to his desk, and take out a sheet of\nthe finest sheepskin parchment, and a pearl-carven inkwell, filled\nwith greenish-silver ink that had been made with true silver and\ncrushed emeralds. From the great trunk at his bed's foot, the\nSlytherin drew forth a book bound also in silver and emeralds,\nentitled The Etiquette of the Houses of Britain. And with\na new, clean quill, Draco Malfoy began to write, frequently looking\nto the book where it lay open as a reference. There was a grim\nsmile on the boy's face, making the young Malfoy look very much\nlike his father, as he carefully drew each letter as though it were\na separate artwork.",
      "From Draco, son of Lucius son of Abraxis Lords of the Noble\nand Most Ancient House of Malfoy, son also of Narcissa daughter of\nDruella Lady of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black, scion\nand heir of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy:",
      "To Hermione, the first Granger:",
      "(That form might have been meant to sound polite, long ago when\nit had been invented; nowadays, after centuries of being used to\naddress mudbloods, it carried a lovely tinge of refined venom.)",
      "I, Draco, of Most Ancient House, demand redress,\nfor",
      "Draco paused, carefully moving the quill aside so that it\nwouldn't drip. He needed a pretext for this, at least if he wanted\nto impose the duel's conditions. The challenged had the choice of\nterms unless they had insulted a Noble House. He needed to\nmake it look like Granger had insulted him...",
      "What was he thinking? Granger had insulted him.",
      "Draco flipped the book to the page of standard formulae, and\nfound one that seemed appropriate.",
      "I, Draco, of Most Ancient House, demand redress, for that I\nhave thrice over helped you and offered you only my goodwill, and\nin return you falsely accused me of plotting\nagainst you,",
      "Draco had to stop and take a breath, forcing down the seething\nanger; he was starting to genuinely feel the insult now, and he'd\njust written out the last phrase and underlined it without\nthinking, like it was an ordinary letter. After a moment's\nreflection, he decided to let it stand; it might not be the exact\nformal phrasing but it had a raw, angry tone that seemed\nappropriate.",
      "which insult you committed before the eyes of\nBritain.",
      "Thus I, Draco, compel you, Hermione, by custom, by law,\nby",
      "\"The seventeenth ruling of the thirty-first Wizengamot,\" Draco\nsaid aloud without looking, a line delivered in many plays; he sat\nstraighter as he said it, feeling every pulse of the noble blood in\nhis veins.",
      "Thus I, Draco, compel you, Hermione, by custom, by law, by\nthe 17th ruling of the 31st Wizengamot, to meet me in wizard's duel\nwith terms: That we each come alone and in silence, speaking to\nnone before or after,",
      "If the duel went poorly, Draco could just say nothing and leave\nit at that. And if he did defeat Granger, he would have learned\nexperimentally that he could beat her again in a public\nchallenge. It wasn't cheating, but it was Science, which was almost\nas good.",
      "contesting by magic solely, without death or lasting\ninjury,",
      "...where? Draco had been told about a room in Hogwarts that was\ngood for duels, where everything valuable was already protected by\nwards, and there were no portraits to tattle on you... which one\nhad it been again...",
      "in the trophy room of the Castle of the Hogwarts School of\nWitchcraft and Wizardry,",
      "And their second and public duel had better be soon, like\ntomorrow, it would take very little time for his reputation in\nSlytherin to go irretrievably to sludge. He needed to fight Granger\nfor the first time tonight.",
      "upon midnight's stroke that shall end this very\nday.",
      "Draco, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of\nMalfoy.",
      "Draco signed the formal parchment, and then drew forth his\nordinary and lesser parchment, and his regular ink, for his post\nscriptum:",
      "If you don't know how the rules work, Granger, here's how it\nis. You insulted a Most Ancient House, and I've got the lawful\nright to challenge. And if you affront the conditions of the duel,\nlike by having Flitwick show up at the trophy room, or even just\ntelling anyone else, my father will take you and your false honor\nstraight to the Wizengamot.",
      "Draco Malfo",
      "On the last letter his quill pressed down on the parchment so\nviciously that the nib snapped off, creating a streak of ink and a\nsmall rip in the parchment, which Draco decided also looked\nappropriate.",
      "That night at dinnertime, Susan Bones came to Harry Potter and\ntold him that she thought Draco Malfoy was going to carry out his\nplot against Hermione very soon. She was warning all the members of\nS.P.H.E.W., and she'd warned Professor Sprout, and she'd warned\nProfessor Flitwick, and she was going to send a letter to her Aunt\ntonight, and now she was warning Harry Potter, too. Only they\ncouldn't quite talk about it with Padma - Susan said, looking very\nserious - because Padma was feeling torn between her loyalty to\nHermione and her loyalty to her General.",
      "Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, who was at this point feeling\nmore frustrated with the entire situation than anything really\nproductive, snapped at her that yes, he knew\nsomething had to be done.",
      "After Susan Bones left, Harry looked over at the other end of\nthe Ravenclaw table, where Hermione had sat down away from him or\nPadma or Anthony or any of her other friends.",
      "But Hermione didn't look like she was in a mood where somebody\ngoing over and bothering her would be taken very well.",
      "Later, looking backward, Harry would think of how, in his SF and\nfantasy novels, people always made their big, important choices for\nbig, important reasons. Hari Seldon had created his Foundation to\nrebuild the ashes of the Galactic Empire, not because he would look\nmore important if he could be in charge of his own research group.\nRaistlin Majere had severed ties with his brother because he wanted\nto become a god, not because he was incompetent at personal\nrelationships and unwilling to ask for advice on how to do better.\nFrodo Baggins had taken the Ring because he was a hero who wanted\nto save Middle-Earth, not because it would've been too awkward not\nto. If anyone ever wrote a true history of the world - not that\nanyone ever could or would - probably 97% of all the key moments of\nFate would turn out to be constructed of lies and tissue paper and\ntrivial little thoughts that somebody could've just as easily\nthought differently.",
      "Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres looked at Hermione Granger,\nwhere she'd sat down at the other end of the table, and felt a\nsense of reluctance to bother her when she looked like she was\nalready in a bad mood.",
      "So then Harry thought that it probably made more sense to talk\nto Draco Malfoy first, just so that he could absolutely positively\ndefinitely assure Hermione that Draco really wasn't plotting\nagainst her.",
      "And later on after dinner, when Harry went down to the Slytherin\nbasement and was told by Vincent that the boss ain't to be\ndisturbed... then Harry thought that maybe he should see if\nHermione would talk to him right away. That he should just get\nstarted on unraveling the whole mess before it raveled any further.\nHarry wondered if he might just be procrastinating, if his mind had\njust found a clever excuse to put off something\nunenjoyable-but-necessary.",
      "He actually thought that.",
      "And then Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres decided that he'd just\ntalk to Draco Malfoy the next morning instead, after Sunday\nbreakfast, and then talk to Hermione.",
      "Human beings did that sort of thing all the time.",
      "It was Sunday morning, on the 5th of April, 1992, and the\nsimulated sky above the Great Hall of Hogwarts showed great\ntorrents of rain pouring down in such density that the lightning\nflashes were diminished and scattered into small pulses of white\nlight that sometimes transformed the House tables, paling their\nfaces and making all the students appear briefly to be ghosts.",
      "Harry sat at the Ravenclaw table, wearily eating a waffle,\nwaiting for Draco to make an appearance so that he could get\nstarted on sorting this whole thing out. There was a\nQuibbler being passed around which had somehow ended up\nwith Hannah and Daphne on the front page, but it hadn't gotten to\nhis place yet.",
      "A few minutes later Harry finished eating his waffle, and then\nlooked around again to see if Draco had arrived yet for breakfast\nat the Slytherin table.",
      "It was odd.",
      "Draco Malfoy was almost never late.",
      "Since Harry was looking in the direction of the Slytherin table,\nhe didn't see Hermione Granger entering through the huge doors of\nthe Great Hall. Thus he was rather startled when he turned back and\ndiscovered Hermione sitting down directly beside him at the\nRavenclaw table, just as if she hadn't not-done that for more than\na week.",
      "\"Hi, Harry,\" Hermione said, her voice sounding almost exactly\nnormal. She started to put toast on her plate and a selection of\nhealthy fruits and vegetables. \"How are you?\"",
      "\"Within one standard deviation of my own peculiar little\naverage,\" Harry automatically replied. \"How are you doing? Did you\nsleep okay?\"",
      "There were dark bags under Hermione Granger's eyes.",
      "\"Why, yes, I'm fine,\" said Hermione Granger.",
      "\"Um,\" Harry said. He took a slice of pie onto his plate (as his\nbrain was occupied with other things, Harry's hand simply took the\ntastiest thing within range, without evaluating complex concepts\nlike whether he was ready to eat dessert). \"Um, Hermione, I'm going\nto need to talk to you later today, is that okay?\"",
      "\"Sure,\" said Hermione. \"Why wouldn't it be?\"",
      "\"Because -\" Harry said. \"I mean - you and I haven't - for the\nlast few days -\"",
      "Shut up, suggested an internal part of Harry that\nseemed to have been recently allocated for governing\nHermione-related issues.",
      "Hermione Granger didn't look like she was paying much attention\nto him in any case. She just stared down at her plate, and then,\nafter about ten seconds of awkward silence, began to eat her tomato\nslices, one after another, without pause.",
      "Harry looked away from her and began to eat a slice of pie\nwhich, he discovered, had somehow materialized on his plate.",
      "\"So!\" Hermione Granger suddenly said after she'd polished off\nmost of her plate in silence. \"Anything happening today?\"",
      "\"Um...\" Harry said. He looked around frantically, as though to\nfind something-happening that he could use as conversational\nfodder.",
      "And so Harry was one of the first to see it, and wordlessly\npoint, although the sudden swell of whispers that swept through the\nGreat Hall showed that a number of other people had seen it\ntoo.",
      "The distinctive crimson tinge of the robes would have been\nrecognizable anywhere, but it still took Harry's brain a few\nmoments to place the faces. An Asianish-looking man, solemn, and\ntoday looking rather grim. A man with a piercing gaze that swept\nover the room, his long black hair waving behind him in a ponytail.\nA man thin and pale and unshaven, with a face so blank that it was\nlike stone. It took Harry a few moment to place the faces, and\nremember the names, from that long-ago day in January when the\nDementor had come to Hogwarts: Komodo, Butnaru,\nGoryanof.",
      "\"An Auror trio?\" Hermione said in a strange bright voice. \"Why,\nI wonder what they'd be doing here.\"",
      "Dumbledore was in their company as well, looking as worried as\nHarry had ever seen him; and after a moment's pause while the old\nwizard's eyes scanned the Great Hall and the students whispering\nover their breakfasts, he pointed -",
      "- straight at Harry.",
      "\"Oh, now what,\" Harry said under his breath. His inward thoughts\nwere a lot more panicked than that, as he wondered frantically if\nanyone had connected him to the Azkaban breakout somehow. He looked\nat the Head Table, trying to make the glance casual, and realized\nthat Professor Quirrell was nowhere to be seen, this morning -",
      "The Aurors swept toward him with swift strides, Auror Goryanof\napproaching from the other side of the Ravenclaw table as though to\nblock any escape in that direction, Auror Komodo and Auror Butnaru\napproaching from Harry's side, the Headmaster following straight on\nKomodo's heels.",
      "All conversation everywhere had ground to utter silence.",
      "The Aurors reached Harry's place at the table, surrounding him\nfrom three angles.",
      "\"Yes?\" Harry said, as normally as he could. \"What is it?\"",
      "\"Hermione Granger,\" Auror Komodo said in a toneless voice, \"you\nare under arrest for the attempted murder of Draco Malfoy.\""

      "\"Hermione Granger,\" Auror Komodo said in a toneless voice,\n\"you are under arrest for the attempted murder of Draco\nMalfoy.\"",
      "The words dropped into Harry's consciousness and shattered his\nthoughts into a hundred shards of incredulity, the shock of\nadrenaline running into so much confusion that -",
      "\"She -\" Harry said. \"She - she wouldn't - WHAT?\"",
      "The Aurors weren't paying any attention to him. Komodo spoke\nagain, still in that colorless voice. \"Mr. Malfoy has regained\nconsciousness in St. Mungo's and named you, Hermione Granger, as\nhis assaulter. He has repeated these accusations under two drops of\nVeritaserum. The Blood-Cooling Charm you cast upon Mr. Malfoy would\nhave killed him if he had not been found and treated, and it must\nbe presumed known to you that this was a fatal curse. I therefore\narrest you upon the serious charge of attempted murder and you will\nbe taken into Ministry custody to be interrogated under three drops\nof Veritaserum -\"",
      "\"Are you mad?\u202f\" the words burst out of Harry's mouth,\nas he shoved himself up from the Ravenclaw table, an instant before\nAuror Butnaru's hand clamped down hard upon his shoulder. Harry\nignored it. \"That's Hermione Granger you're trying to\narrest, the nicest girl in Ravenclaw, she helps Hufflepuffs with\ntheir homework, she'd die before she tried to kill\nanyone -\"",
      "Hermione Granger's face had crumpled. \"I did it,\" she whispered\nin a tiny voice. \"It was me.\"",
      "Another huge rock fell on Harry's thoughts and crushed their\nfragile order, bursting fragments of comprehension into dust.",
      "Dumbledore's face seemed to have aged decades over the course of\nseconds. \"Why, Miss Granger?\" Dumbledore said, his own voice barely\nabove a whisper. \"Why would you do such a thing?\"",
      "\"I'm,\" Hermione said, \"I'm, I'm - sorry - I don't know why I -\"\nShe seemed to collapse in on herself, her voice was formed of\nnothing but sobs, and the only words that could be made out were,\n\"I thought - killed him - sorry -\"",
      "And Harry should have said something, should have done\nsomething, should have jumped up out of his seat and stunned all\nthree Aurors and then gone on to some incredibly clever next move,\nbut the twice-shattered fragments of his thought processes could\nyield no output. Butnaru's hand pushed Harry gently but firmly back\ninto his seat and Harry found himself stuck there like\nhe'd been glued, he tried to grab his wand for a Finite\nand it wouldn't come out of his pocket, the three Aurors and\nDumbledore escorted Hermione out of the Great Hall amid a rising\nstorm of outcries and the doors began to swing shut behind them -\nnothing made sense, it was surreal beyond all reckoning, like he'd\nbeen transported into an alternate universe, and then Harry's mind\nflashed back to another day of confusion and in a moment of\ndesperate inspiration he finally realized what the Weasley twins\nhad done to Rita Skeeter, and his voice rose in a scream,\n\"HERMIONE YOU DIDN'T DO IT YOU'VE BEEN\nFALSE-MEMORY-CHARMED!\"",
      "But the doors had already shut.",
      "Minerva couldn't possibly have stood still, she paced back and\nforth through the Headmaster's office, the back of her mind\nhalf-expecting Severus or Harry to tell her to shut up and sit\ndown, but neither the Potions Master or the Boy-Who-Lived seemed\nmuch concerned with her, both of their gazes focused on Albus\nDumbledore where he had emerged from the Floo. There were sounds in\nthe background that nobody heard. Severus seemed as passionless as\never, sitting in a small cushioned chair beside the Headmaster's\ndesk. The old wizard stood terrible and upright by the\nstill-burning fireplace, robed in black like a starless night,\nradiating power and dismay. All her own thoughts were of utter\nconfusion and horror. Harry Potter sat on a wooden stool with his\nfingers gripping the seat, and his eyes were fury and freezing\nice.",
      "At 6:33am, Quirinus Quirrell had Flooed St. Mungo's from his\noffice for immediate pickup of Draco Malfoy. Professor Quirrell had\nfound Mr. Malfoy in the trophy room of Hogwarts, on the verge of\ndeath from the continuing effects of the Blood-Cooling Charm slowly\nlowering his body temperature. Professor Quirrell had immediately\ndispelled the Charm, cast stabilizing spells on Mr. Malfoy, and\nlevitated him to his office to Floo him to St. Mungo's for further\ntreatment. After this, Professor Quirrell had informed the\nHeadmaster, stating the facts briefly before vanishing through the\nFloo; the Aurors, notified by St. Mungo's, had demanded his\npresence for questioning.",
      "The clear intent of the Blood-Cooling Charm had been to kill\nDraco Malfoy so slowly that the wards of Hogwarts, set to detect\nsudden injury, would not trigger. Under interrogation, Professor\nQuirrell had told the Aurors that he had cast several tracking\nCharms upon Mr. Malfoy's person in January, shortly after Mr.\nMalfoy's return to Hogwarts from Yuletime break. Professor Quirrell\nhad cast tracking Charms because he had learned of a person with a\nmotive to harm Mr. Malfoy. Professor Quirrell had refused to\nidentify this person. The tracking Charms which Professor Quirrell\nhad cast were triggered by Mr. Malfoy's health falling below an\nabsolute level, rather than by sudden changes, and had therefore\nalerted Professor Quirrell before Mr. Malfoy had died.",
      "Two drops of Veritaserum, sufficient to prevent Mr. Malfoy from\nwithholding any meliorating or moderating information in his\nstatements, had shown that Mr. Malfoy had - legally under the laws\nof Noble Houses, illegally under the regulations of Hogwarts -\nchallenged Hermione Granger to a duel. Mr. Malfoy had won the duel\nbut had then, as he left, been attacked from behind by Miss Granger\nwith a Stunning Hex. After this Mr. Malfoy knew nothing.",
      "Three drops of Veritaserum, requiring her to volunteer all\nrelevant information, had caused Hermione Granger to confess that\nshe had stunned Draco Malfoy from behind, and then, in a fit of\nanger, cast the Blood-Cooling Charm on him, with the deliberate\nintention of killing him slowly enough to evade identification from\nthe Hogwarts wards, whose workings she had read about in\nHogwarts: A History. She had been horrified at herself\nupon awakening the next morning, but had not told anyone of what\nshe'd done, believing Draco Malfoy to be already dead - as he\ncertainly would have been after seven hours, had his body's own\nmagic not been resisting the effects of the Blood-Cooling\nCharm.",
      "\"Her trial,\" said Albus Dumbledore, \"is set for tomorrow at\nnoon.\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" the word burst out of Harry Potter. The\nBoy-Who-Lived didn't rise from his chair, but Minerva saw his\nfingers whiten where they gripped the wooden seat beneath him.\n\"That's insane! You can't do a police investigation in one day\n-\"",
      "The Potions Master raised his voice. \"This is not\nMuggle Britain, Mr. Potter!\" Severus's face was as\nexpressionless as ever, but the bite in his voice was sharp. \"The\nAurors have an accusation under Veritaserum and a confession under\nVeritaserum. So far as they are concerned, the investigation is\ndone.\"",
      "\"Not quite,\" said Dumbledore, just as Harry seemed ready to\nexplode. \"I have insisted to Amelia that this matter be given the\nutmost scrutiny. Unfortunately, as the ill-fated duel was at\nmidnight -\"",
      "\"Supposed duel,\" Harry said sharply.",
      "\"As the supposed duel was at midnight - yes, you're\nquite right, Harry - it is beyond the range of any Time-Turner\n-\"",
      "\"Also supposedly,\" the Boy-Who-Lived said coldly. \"And\nrather suspiciously, since the alleged murder suspect\ndoesn't know about Time-Turners. I hope that an invisible Auror was\nimmediately sent back in time as far as possible to observe -\"",
      "Dumbledore inclined his head. \"I went myself, Harry,\nthe moment I heard. But by the time I reached the trophy room, Mr.\nMalfoy was already unconscious and Miss Granger had gone -\"",
      "\"No,\" said Harry Potter. \"You reached the trophy room and saw\nDraco unconscious. That is all you observed, Headmaster. You did\nnot observe Hermione there, or watch her leave. Let us\ndistinguish observation from inference.\" The boy's head turned to\nlook at her. \"Imperius, Obliviation, False Memory Charm,\nLegilimency. Professor McGonagall, am I leaving out any\nmind-affecting spell that could have made Hermione do this or make\nher believe she'd done it?\"",
      "\"The Confundus Charm,\" she said. And the Dark Arts had never\nbeen her study, but she knew - \"And certain Dark rituals. But none\nof those could be performed in Hogwarts without alarm.\"",
      "The boy nodded, his eyes still directly addressing her. \"Which\nof those spells can be detected? Which would the Aurors try to\ndetect?\"",
      "\"The Confundus Charm would wear off in a few hours,\" she said,\nafter a moment to gather her thoughts. \"Miss Granger would remember\nthe Imperius. Obliviation cannot be detected by any known means,\nbut only a Professor could have cast that spell upon a student\nwithout alarm from the Hogwarts wards. Legilimency - can only be\ndetected by another Legilimens, I think -\"",
      "\"I requested that Miss Granger be examined by the court\nLegilimens,\" said Dumbledore. \"The examination showed -\"",
      "\"Do we trust him?\" said Harry.",
      "\"Her,\" said Dumbledore. \"Sophie McJorgenson, whom I remember as\nan honest student of Ravenclaw, and she is bound by the Unbreakable\nVow to tell the truth of what she sees -\"",
      "\"Could someone else be Polyjuiced as her?\" Harry Potter\ninterrupted again. \"What did you observe, Headmaster?\"",
      "Albus said heavily, \"A person who looked like Madam McJorgenson\ntold us that a single Legilimens had lightly touched Miss Granger's\nmind some months ago. That is from January, Harry, when I\ncommunicated with Miss Granger about the matter of a certain\nDementor. That was expected; but what I did not expect was the rest\nof what Sophie found.\" The old wizard turned to gaze into the Floo\nfire, letting the orange flames reflect on his face. \"As you say,\nHarry, a False Memory Charm is one possibility; they are, when cast\nperfectly, indistinguishable from true memory -\"",
      "\"That doesn't surprise me,\" Harry interrupted. \"Studies show\nthat human memories are more or less rewritten every time we\nremember them -\"",
      "\"Harry,\" Minerva said softly, and the boy's mouth clamped\nshut.",
      "The old wizard continued. \"- but a False Memory Charm of such\nquality requires as much time to create as a true memory. Creating\na detailed memory of ten minutes would be ten minutes' work. And\naccording to the court Legilimens,\" Albus's face now seemed more\ntired and lined than before, \"Miss Granger has been obsessing over\nMr. Malfoy since the day that Severus... yelled at her. She has\nbeen thinking of how Mr. Malfoy might be in league with Professor\nSnape, how he might be planning to harm her and harm Harry -\nimagining it for hours every day - it would be impossible to create\nfalse memories for so much time.\"",
      "\"The appearance of insanity...\" Severus murmured softly, as\nthough he were speaking to himself. \"Could it be natural?\nNo, it is too disastrous to be pure accident; too convenient for\nsomeone, I have no doubt. A Muggle drug, perhaps? But that\nwould not be enough - Miss Granger's madness would have to be\nguided -\"",
      "\"Ah!\" Harry said suddenly. \"I get it now. The first\nFalse Memory Charm was cast on Hermione after Professor Snape\nyelled at her, and showed, say, Draco and Professor Snape plotting\nto kill her. Then last night that False Memory was removed\nby Obliviation, leaving behind the memories of her obsessing about\nDraco for no apparent reason, at the same time she and Draco were\ngiven false memories of the duel.\"",
      "Minerva blinked in startlement. It would have been a thousand\nyears before she thought of that possibility.",
      "The Potions Master was frowning thoughtfully, eyes intent. \"The\nreaction to a False Memory Charm is hard to predict in\nadvance, Mr. Potter, without Legilimency. The subjects do not\nalways act as expected, when they first remember the false\nmemories. It would have been a risky ploy. But I suppose that is\none way Professor Quirrell could have done it.\"",
      "\"Professor Quirrell?\u202f\" said Harry. \"What motive does\nhe have to -\"",
      "The Potions Master said dryly, \"The Defense Professor is always\na suspect, Mr. Potter. You will notice a trend, given time.\"",
      "Albus raised up a hand, a silencing gesture, and their heads all\nturned to look at him. \"But in this case there is another suspect,\"\nAlbus said quietly. \"Voldemort.\"",
      "That deadliest of unspeakable words seemed to echo around the\nroom, canceling all the heat from the orange flames of the\nfireplace.",
      "\"I do not know,\" the old wizard said slowly, \"I know all too\nlittle, of the methods of Voldemort's immortality. He searched out\nthose books before I did, I think. All I could find were ancient\ntales, scattered across too many volumes for him to remove. But to\nfind truth among many stories is also a wizard's mastery, and this\nI have endeavored to do. There is a human sacrifice, a murder, of\nthat I am certain; committed in coldest blood, the victim dying in\nhorror. And old, old tales of wizards possessed, doing mad deeds,\nclaiming the names of Dark Lords thought defeated; and there is\nusually a device, of that Dark Lord, which they wield...\" Albus\nlooked at Harry, the ancient eyes searching the younger. \"I think,\nHarry - though you will call it only inference - that the act of\nmurder splits the soul. That by ritual of blackest horror, the torn\nfragment of soul is chained to this world. To a material thing of\nthis world. Which must be, or which then becomes, a device of\npower.\"",
      "Horcrux. The terrible name echoed in Minerva's mind,\nthough it seemed that - for what reason she did not know - Albus\nwould not speak that word in front of Harry.",
      "\"And therefore,\" the old wizard finished quietly, \"the remainder\nof the soul is bound to its chained part, lingering here when its\nbody is destroyed. A sad and painful existence, I think it would\nbe; less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost...\" The old\nwizard's eyes were locked on Harry, who gazed back with his eyes\nnarrowed. \"It would take time for that mutilated soul to regain a\nmockery of life. That is why we have had our ten-year reprieve, I\nbelieve; why Voldemort did not return at once. But in time... that\nrevenant would become capable of rising again.\" The old wizard\nspoke with grim precision. \"It is clear, from the stories, that the\nDark Lords who return by possessing another's form, wield lesser\nmagics than they once knew. I do not think Voldemort would be\nsatisfied with that. He would take some other avenue to life. But\nVoldemort was more Slytherin than Salazar, grasping at every\nopportunity. He would use his pitiful state, use\nhis power of possession, if he had reason. If he could benefit by\nanother's... inexplicable fury.\" Albus's voice had fallen to almost\na whisper. \"That is what I suspect happened to Miss Granger.\"",
      "Minerva's throat was very dry. \"He's here,\" she gasped.\n\"Here, in Hogwarts -\"",
      "Then she stopped, because the reason Voldemort had come\nto Hogwarts -",
      "The old wizard glanced at her only briefly, and said, still in\nthat whisper, \"I am sorry, Minerva, you were right.\"",
      "Harry's voice was edged. \"Right about what?\"",
      "\"Voldemort's strongest avenue to life,\" Dumbledore said heavily.\n\"The most desirable road for him, by which he would rise greater\nand more terrible than ever before. It is guarded here, within this\ncastle -\"",
      "\"Excuse me,\" Harry said politely. \"Are you stupid?\"",
      "\"Harry,\" she said, but there was no force in her voice.",
      "\"I mean, maybe you haven't noticed this, Headmaster Dumbledore,\nbut this castle is full of CHILDREN -\"",
      "\"I had no choice!\u202f\" bellowed Dumbledore. The blue eyes\nwere blazing now, beneath the half-moon spectacles. \"I do not\nown it, that thing which Voldemort desires. It belongs to\nanother, and is held here by his consent! I asked\nif it could be kept in the Department of Mysteries. But he\nwould not permit that - he said it must be within the wards of\nHogwarts, in the place of the Founders' protection -\" Dumbledore\npassed his hand across his forehead. \"No,\" the old wizard said in a\nquieter voice. \"I cannot pass this blame to him. He is right. There\nis too much power in that thing, too much that men desire. I agreed\nthat the trap should be laid behind the wards of Hogwarts, in the\nplace of my own power.\" The old wizard bowed his head. \"I knew\nVoldemort would worm his way here somehow, and planned to trap him.\nI did not think - I did not dream - that he would tarry in an enemy\nfortress one minute longer than he must.\"",
      "\"But,\" said Severus in some puzzlement, \"what would the Dark\nLord possibly gain by killing Lucius's only heir?\"",
      "\"Point of order,\" Harry Potter said, a hard edge in his voice.\n\"The motives of whoever's behind this are not the primary issue.\nOur top priority at this point is that an innocent Hogwarts student\nis in trouble!\u202f\"",
      "The green eyes locked with the blue, as Albus Dumbledore gazed\nback at the Boy-Who-Lived -",
      "\"Quite right, Mr. Potter,\" Minerva said, she hadn't even thought\nabout it, the words just seemed to pop out of her lips. \"Albus, who\nis watching over Miss Granger now?\"",
      "\"Professor Flitwick has gone to her,\" the Headmaster said.",
      "\"She needs a lawyer,\" Harry said. \"Anyone who just\nblurts out 'I did it' to the police -\"",
      "\"Unfortunately,\" Minerva said, her tone taking on some of\nProfessor McGonagall's sternness without thinking, \"I doubt an\nattorney will be any use to Miss Granger at this point, Mr. Potter.\nShe is to face the judgment of the Wizengamot, and they would be\nexceedingly unlikely to free her on a technicality.\"",
      "Harry was looking at her with an utterly incredulous expression,\nas though suggesting that Hermione Granger didn't need an attorney\nwas akin to suggesting that she be set on fire.",
      "\"She is correct, Mr. Potter,\" Severus said quietly. \"Few court\nprocesses in this country involve solicitors.\"",
      "Harry lifted his glasses and rubbed his eyes, briefly. \"Fine.\nHow do we get Hermione off the hook, exactly? I suppose it's too\nmuch to hope that with all the lawyers gone, the judges understand\nthe concept of 'common sense' and 'prior probability' well enough\nto realize that twelve-year-old girls basically never commit\ncold-blooded murders?\"",
      "\"It is the Wizengamot that she faces,\" said Severus. \"The oldest\nNoble Houses, and certain other wizards of influence.\" Severus's\nface twisted in something approaching his customary sarcasm. \"As\nfor them showing common sense - you might as well expect them to\nmake you a bacon sandwich, Potter.\"",
      "Harry nodded, his mouth set. \"Exactly what sort of penalty is\nHermione facing? Snapped wand and expulsion -\"",
      "\"No,\" Severus said. \"Nothing that light. Are you willfully\nmisunderstanding, Potter? She is facing the Wizengamot.\nThere is no set penalty. There is only the vote.\"",
      "Harry Potter murmured, \"The rule of law, in complex times,\nhas proved itself deficient; we much prefer the rule of men, it's\nvastly more efficient... There's no constraining legal rules\nat all, then?\"",
      "Light glinted off the old wizard's half-moon glasses; he spoke\ncarefully, and not without anger. \"Legally, Harry, we are dealing\nwith a blood debt from Hermione Granger to the House of Malfoy. The\nLord of Malfoy proposes a repayment of that debt, and then the\nWizengamot votes on his proposal. That is all.\"",
      "\"But...\" Harry said slowly. \"Lucius was Sorted into Slytherin,\nhe's got to realize that Hermione was just a pawn. Not the\none he should actually be angry at. Right?\"",
      "\"No, Harry Potter,\" Albus Dumbledore said heavily. \"That is how\nyou wish Lucius Malfoy would think. Lucius Malfoy\nhimself... will not share your desire that he think that way.\"",
      "Harry gazed at the Headmaster, his eyes growing colder, at the\nsame time that Minerva herself had to clamp down harder on her own\nemotions, stop her pacing and try to breathe. She'd been trying not\nto think about it, trying to turn her thoughts away from it, but\nshe knew. She'd known since the instant she'd heard. She could see\nit in Albus's eyes -",
      "\"Is she facing capital punishment?\" Harry said quietly, and\nchills went all the way down Minerva's spine at the undertones of\nthat voice.",
      "\"No!\" Albus said. \"No, not the Kiss, not Azkaban, not for a\nfirst-year in Hogwarts. Our country is not so lost, not yet.\"",
      "\"But Lucius Malfoy,\" Severus said tonelessly, \"certainly will\nnot be satisfied with only snapping her wand.\"",
      "\"All right,\" Harry said commandingly. \"As I see it, we've got\ntwo essential lines of attack. Line one, find the real culprit.\nLine two, other leverage over Lucius. Professor Quirrell saved\nDraco's life, does that create a blood debt from House Malfoy to\nhim that he could redeem to cancel Hermione's?\"",
      "Minerva blinked in startlement again.",
      "\"No,\" Dumbledore said. The old wizard shook his head. \"It was a\nclever thought - but no, Harry, I'm afraid not. There is an\nexception when the Wizengamot suspects that the circumstances of a\nlife-debt may have been created deliberately. And the Defense\nProfessor is hardly above suspicion. Thus Lucius would argue.\"",
      "Harry nodded once, face set. \"Headmaster, I know I said I\nwouldn't - but under the circumstances - that time Draco cast that\ntorture hex on me, is that debt enough -\"",
      "\"No,\" the old wizard said (even as she blurted \"What?\u202f\"\nand Severus lifted an eyebrow). \"It would not have been enough, and\nnow it is no debt at all. You are an Occlumens and cannot testify\nunder Veritaserum. Draco Malfoy could be Obliviated of his own\nmemory before he could testify -\" Albus hesitated. \"Harry...\nwhatever you have done with Draco, you must assume that Lucius\nMalfoy will soon know of it.\"",
      "Harry's head sank into his hands. \"He'll give Draco\nVeritaserum.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Albus said quietly.",
      "The Boy-Who-Lived didn't say anything, as he sat with his head\nin his hands.",
      "The Potions Master looked genuinely shocked. \"Draco really\nwas trying to help Miss Granger,\" Severus said. \"You -\nPotter, you actually -\"",
      "\"Turned him?\" Harry said from between his hands. \"I was about\nthree-quarters done. Taught him the Patronus Charm and everything.\nI don't know what will happen now, though.\"",
      "\"Voldemort has struck a grave blow against us, this day,\" Albus\nsaid. The sound of old wizard's voice was like the look of the boy\nwith his head in his hands. \"He has taken two of our pieces, with\none... No. I should have seen it earlier. He has taken two of\nHarry's pieces with one move. Voldemort has begun his game\nagain, not against myself, but against Harry. Voldemort\nknows the prophecy, he knows who his last foe shall be. He is not\nwaiting to face Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy at Harry's side\nwhen they are grown. He is striking at them now.\"",
      "\"Maybe it's You-Know-Who and maybe it isn't,\" Harry said, his\nvoice sounding a little unsteady. \"Let's not narrow down the\nhypothesis space prematurely.\" Harry took a breath and lowered his\nhands. \"The other thing we can try is to nail the real culprit\nbefore the trial - or at least find solid evidence that\nsomeone else did it.\"",
      "\"Mr. Potter,\" said Minerva, \"Professor Quirrell told the Aurors\nthat he knew of someone with a motive to harm Mr. Malfoy. Do\nyou know who he was talking about?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry said, after a hesitation. \"But I think I shall\nconduct that part of my investigation with the Defense Professor -\njust as I would not have Professor Quirrell in the room while we\nwere discussing how to investigate him.\"",
      "\"He suspects me?\" Severus said, then gave a short laugh. \"Why,\nof course he does.\"",
      "\"My own plan,\" said Harry, \"is to go look at the trophy room\nwhere the supposed duel took place and see if I can discover\nanything anomalous. If you can tell the investigating Aurors to let\nme through -\"",
      "\"What investigating Aurors?\" Severus said tonelessly.",
      "Harry Potter took a deep breath, slowly let it out, and then\nspoke again. \"In mystery books it usually takes longer than one day\nto solve a crime, but twenty-four hours is - no, thirty\nhours is eighteen hundred minutes. And I can think of at least one\nother important place to look for clues - though it'll have to be\nsomeone who can get into the Ravenclaw girls' dorm. Back when\nHermione was fighting bullies, she was finding notes under her\npillow each morning, telling her where to go -\"",
      "\"Albus...\" ground out Minerva.",
      "\"I did not send them,\" said the old wizard. His white eyebrows\nhad lifted in surprise. \"I knew nothing of this. You think she was\nbeing played, Harry?\"",
      "\"It's a possibility,\" Harry said. \"More so, because there's a\npart of this puzzle that you don't know about yet.\" Harry's voice\nlowered, grew more intense. \"Headmaster, you already know that I\ngot my father's invisibility cloak from someone who left a note\nunder my pillow, saying it was an early Christmas present. I think\nwe have to assume that's the same person who left notes for\nHermione -\"",
      "\"Harry,\" the old wizard said, and hesitated momentarily.\n\"Returning your father's cloak to you, does not seem to me like the\nact of a villain -\"",
      "\"Listen,\" Harry Potter said urgently. \"The part you\ndon't know is that after Bellatrix Black escaped from\nAzkaban, I found another note under my pillow, signed 'Santa\nClaus', saying that they'd heard you were shutting me up inside\nHogwarts, and that they were giving me an escape route to the Salem\nWitches' Institute in America. That note came with a deck of cards,\nin which the King of Hearts was supposedly a portkey -\"",
      "\"Mr. Potter!\u202f\" cried Professor McGonagall, she hadn't\neven thought before she spoke. \"That could well be a kidnapping\nattempt! You should have told - \"",
      "\"Yes, Professor, I did the sensible thing,\" the boy\nsaid levelly. \"As adapted to the circumstances, I did the\nsensible thing. I told Professor Quirrell. And according to\nProfessor Quirrell, that portkey goes to somewhere in London - it's\ndefinitely not strong enough to be an international portkey. Now\nit's possible that the person who sent the note is honest,\nand that the point in London is just a way station.\" The boy\nreached into his robes and took out a deck of cards, along with a\nfolded paper note. \"I will trust you not to go in guns\nblazing - I mean wands blazing - just in case the sender is an ally\nof mine, if not yours. But if this is a trap, I say we spring it\nnow. And whoever it is, take them alive so we can\nexhibit them before the Wizengamot, I cannot overemphasize that\npart.\"",
      "Severus rose from his chair, his eyes now intent, and moved\ntoward Harry. \"I'll need a hair of yours for Polyjuice, Mr. Potter\n-\"",
      "\"Let us not be hasty!\" said Albus. \"We have not yet examined the\nnotes sent to Miss Granger; there may be no resemblance after all.\nSeverus, would you enter her dorm room and see if you can find\nthose?\"",
      "Harry Potter's eyebrows had raised, even as he stood to offer\nthe Potions Master better access to his mess of hair. \"You think\ntwo different people are running around Hogwarts leaving\nnotes beneath pillows?\"",
      "Severus gave a brief sardonic laugh, as his hand moved forward\nand plucked a hair, which soon was being carefully wrapped in silk.\n\"Quite possibly. If I have learned anything in my tenure as Head of\nSlytherin, I have learned what ridiculous messes arise when there\nis more than one plotter and more than one plan. But Headmaster - I\nthink Mr. Potter is correct that I should follow this portkey and\nsee where it leads.\"",
      "Albus hesitated, and then nodded reluctantly. \"I will speak to\nyou before you go, then.\"",
      "Even as Harry Potter left the room for his own investigations,\nSeverus spun on his heel and strode swiftly toward the jar of Floo\npowder, his cloak rising behind him with his speed. \"I'll get some\nraw Polyjuice, add the hair, and go. Headmaster, will you stand by\nto -\"",
      "\"Albus,\" Minerva said, surprised at how steady her own voice\nwas, \"did you leave those notes under Mr. Potter's pillow?\"",
      "Severus's hand halted an instant before casting Floo powder into\nthe fire.",
      "Dumbledore nodded to her, though the accompanying smile seemed a\nbit hollow. \"You know me far too well, my dear.\"",
      "\"And I suppose the portkey goes to a friendly home where Mr.\nPotter would be kept safe and sound until you arrived to pick him\nup and return him to Hogwarts?\" Her voice tight - it was sensible,\nshe could not deny it was sensible, but somehow it seemed a little\ncruel.",
      "\"It would depend on the circumstances,\" the old wizard said\nquietly. \"If Harry had gone so far - I might have let him make good\nhis escape, for a time. Better to know where he was going, and\nensure it was somewhere safe, with friends -\"",
      "\"And to think,\" said Professor McGonagall, \"that I had thought\nto reprimand Mr. Potter for not telling us about this important\nmatter! Upbraid him for not having the sense to trust us!\" Her\nvoice had risen in volume. \"I shall skip that lecture, I\nsuppose!\"",
      "Severus was gazing at the Headmaster with narrowed eyes. \"And\nthe notes to Miss Granger -\"",
      "\"The Defense Professor, very likely,\" the old wizard said.\n\"Still - that is only a guess.\"",
      "\"I shall go look for them,\" Severus said. \"And then, I suppose,\nstart looking for You-Know-Who.\" A frown crossed the Potions\nMaster's face. \"A task at which I haven't the faintest idea of\nwhere to start. Do you know of any magics to find a soul,\nHeadmaster?\"",
      "The Divination classroom was lit by the dim red light of a\nhundred small fires where burned a hundred kinds of incense, so\nthat if you were to ask in one word what the room looked like, the\nanswer would be 'smoke'. (Assuming you bothered to look at\nanything, when your nose was threatening to overload and die.) If\nyour gaze could pierce those dank mists, you would see a tiny,\ncluttered room in which forty stuffed armchairs, most of them\nunused, were crammed around a small open space in the center of the\nroom, where a circular trapdoor waited on your escape.",
      "\"The grim!\" Professor Trelawney said in a quavering voice, as\nshe peered into George Weasley's teacup. \"The grim! It is a sign of\ndeath! One whom you know, George - someone you know is to die! And\nsoon - yes, it shall be quite soon, I think - unless of course it\nis later -\"",
      "It would have been a good deal scarier, thought Fred and George,\nif she hadn't said the same thing to every single other student in\ntheir Divination class. They were hardly even thinking about it at\nthis point; all their thoughts were on today's disaster -",
      "The trapdoor in the floor flew open with a bang that caused\nProfessor Trelawney to shriek and spill George's tea all over his\nrobes, and then an instant later Dumbledore was whooshing up out of\nthe floor with a bird of fire upon his shoulder.",
      "\"Fred!\" the old wizard said commandingly. His robes were the\nblack of a moonless night, his eyes hard like blue diamonds.\n\"George! With me, now!\"",
      "There was an collective gasp and by the time Fred and George\nwere climbing down the ladder after the Headmaster, the entire\nclass was already speculating what role they'd played in the\nattempted murder of Draco Malfoy.",
      "The trapdoor had hardly slammed shut above them before all\nnearby sounds muted and the old wizard spun on them and held out a\nhand and commanded, \"Give me the map!\"",
      "\"M-map?\" said Fred or George in total shock. They'd never even\nsuspected that Dumbledore suspected. \"Why, w-we don't know what\nyou're -\"",
      "\"Hermione Granger is in trouble,\" said the old wizard.",
      "\"The Map is in our dorm,\" George or Fred said immediately. \"Just\ngive us a few minutes to get it and we'll -\"",
      "The wizard's arms swept them up as if they were hugging-pillows,\nthere was a piercing cry and a flash of fire and then the three of\nthem were in the third-year Gryffindor's boys' dorm.",
      "A few moments later, Fred and George were handing over the Map\nto the Headmaster, wincing only slightly at the sacrilege of giving\ntheir precious piece of the Hogwarts security system to the person\nwho actually owned it, and the old wizard was frowning at the\napparent blankness.",
      "\"You've got to say,\" they explained, \"I solemnly swear that\nI am up to no good -\"",
      "\"I decline to lie,\" said the old wizard. He held the Map high\nand bellowed, \"Hear me, Hogwarts! Deligitor prodi!\u202f\" An\ninstant later the Headmaster was wearing the Sorting Hat, which\nlooked scarily right upon his head, as though Dumbledore\nhad always been waiting for a patchwork pointed hat to complete his\nexistence.",
      "(Fred and George immediately memorized this phrase, just in case\nit would work for somebody besides the Headmaster, and began trying\nto think of pranks that would involve the Sorting Hat.)",
      "The old wizard wasted not a moment before sweeping the Sorting\nHat off his head and turning it upside-down - it was hard to tell\nwith the Hat upside-down, but it looked a bit cross at the\ntreatment - and then plunged in his hand and drew out a crystal\nrod. With this instrument he began tracing rune-like patterns on\nthe Map, muttering strange incantations that sounded not quite like\nLatin and echoed in their ears in an unusually creepy fashion. In\nthe midst of tracing one rune he looked up at both of them, fixing\nthem with a sharp glare. \"I will return this to you later, sons of\nWeasley. Go back to class.\"",
      "\"Yes, Headmaster,\" they said, and hesitated. \"Ah - about\nHermione Granger, is she really going to be bound to serve Draco\nMalfoy forever as his -\"",
      "\"Go,\" said the old wizard.",
      "They went.",
      "When he was alone in the room, the old wizard looked down at the\nmap, which had now written upon itself a fine line drawing of the\nGryffindor dorms in which they stood, the small handwritten\nAlbus P.W.B. Dumbledore the only name left therein.",
      "The old wizard smoothed the map, bent over it, and whispered,\n\"Find Tom Riddle.\"",
      "The interrogation room at the Department of Magical Law\nEnforcement was usually lit by a small orange light, so that the\nAuror interrogating you would be leaning toward your uncomfortable\nmetal chair with most of their face in shadow, preventing you from\nreading their expression, even as they read yours.",
      "As soon as Mr. Quirrell had entered the room, the small orange\nlight had dimmed and begun flickering like a candle about to be\nblown out by the wind. The room was now lit by a sourceless\nice-colored glow which illuminated all of Mr. Quirrell's pale skin\nlike alabaster, except, somehow, his eyes, which stayed in\ndarkness.",
      "The Auror on duty outside had surreptitiously tried to dispel\nthis effect four times without the slightest success, despite the\nfact that Mr. Quirrell had politely surrendered his wand upon being\ndetained for interrogation, and had shown no sign of speaking any\nincantations nor exerting any other power.",
      "\"Quirinus... Quirrell,\" drawled the man now sitting across from\nwhere the Defense Professor had waited courteously. The\ninterrogator had tawny hair that swept back like a lion's mane,\nwith yellowish eyes set into the sternly lined face of a man late\nin his tenth decade. The man was, at this moment, leafing through a\nlarge folder of parchments that he had taken from a black and very\nsolid-looking briefcase after he had limped into the room and sat\ndown, seeming not to look at the face of the man he was\ninterrogating. He had not introduced himself.",
      "After some further leafing through parchments, carried out in\nsilence, the Auror spoke again. \"Born the 26th of September, 1955,\nto Quondia Quirrell, of an acknowledged tryst with Lirinus\nLumblung...\" intoned the Auror. \"Sorted into Ravenclaw... O.W.L.S.\nquite good... N.E.W.T.S. in Charms, Transfiguration... an\nOutstanding in Muggle Studies, impressive... Ancient Runes, and ah\nyes, Defense. An Outstanding in that as well. Went on to become\nquite the tourist, visiting all sorts of places. Portkey visas for\nTransylvania, the Forbidden Empire, the City of Endless Night... my\nmy, Texas.\" The man looked up from the portfolio, eyes\nnarrowed. \"What were you doing there, Mr. Quirrell?\"",
      "\"Sightseeing, mostly in the Muggle areas,\" the Defense Professor\nsaid easily. \"As you say, I am quite the tourist.\"",
      "The man listened to this with a frown, then looked back down,\nthen up again. \"I also see that you visited Fuyuki City in\n1983.\"",
      "The Defense Professor lifted an eyebrow in mild puzzlement.\n\"What of it?\"",
      "\"What did you do in Fuyuki City?\" The question snapped out\nrazor-sharp.",
      "The Defense Professor frowned slightly. \"Nothing of any account.\nI visited some better-known sights, some less-known sights, and\naside from that, kept to myself.\"",
      "\"Really?\" the Auror said softly. \"I find that reply rather\ninteresting.\"",
      "\"How so?\" said the Defense Professor.",
      "\"Because there was no visa listed for Fuyuki City.\" The man\nslammed the folder shut. \"You're not Quirinus Quirrell. Who the\nhell are you?\"",
      "The Potions Master walked quietly into the Ravenclaw girls'\ndorm, the first-year dorm room, a festive place where bronze and\nblue competed to be the color of stuffed animals, scarves and\ndresses, small bits of inexpensive jewelry, and posters of famous\npeople. Hermione Granger's bed was easy to identify; it was the one\nthat had been attacked by a book monster.",
      "Nobody else seemed to be around, at that time of day, and a\nnumber of spells verified this.",
      "The Potions Master searched under Hermione Granger's pillow, and\nbeneath her bed, and then began going through her trunk, sorting\nthrough mentionable and unmentionable items without change of\nexpression, and finally succeeded in drawing forth a set of papers\ndescribing places and times where bullies would be found, all of\nthe papers signed only with an elaborate 'S'.",
      "A brief burst of fire later, the papers were gone, and the\nPotions Master left to report the failure of his mission.",
      "The Defense Professor was sitting calmly with his hands still\nfolded in his lap. \"If you consult Headmaster Dumbledore,\" said the\nDefense Professor, \"you will find that he is well aware of this\nmatter, and that I agreed to teach his Defense class on the\nexplicit condition that no inquiry be made into my -\"",
      "In a lightning motion, the interrogator whipped out his wand and\nspat \"Polyfluis Reverso!\u202f\" at the same time that the\nDefense Professor sneezed, which somehow caused the mirror-silvered\nray to disrupt in a shower of white sparks.",
      "\"Pardon me,\" the Defense Professor said politely.",
      "The smile that the Auror gave had absolutely no mirth in it. \"So\nwhere's the real Quirinus Quirrell, eh? Under an Imperius in the\nbottom of a trunk somewhere, while you take a hair now and then for\nyour illegal Polyjuice?\"",
      "\"You are making highly questionable assumptions,\" the Defense\nProfessor said with an edged voice. \"What makes you think I did not\nsteal his body outright using incredibly Dark magic?\"",
      "This was followed by a certain pause.",
      "\"I suggest,\" the Auror said, \"that you take this seriously, Mr.\nWhoever-You-Are.\"",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" said the Defense Professor, leaning back in his\nchair, \"but I see little reason to humble myself on this particular\noccasion. What are you going to do, kill me?\"",
      "\"I don't appreciate your humor,\" the Auror said softly.",
      "\"How unfortunate for you, Rufus Scrimgeour,\" said the Defense\nProfessor. \"You have my deepest sympathy.\" He tilted his head,\nseeming to study the interrogator; and even within the shadow of\nthe ice-light, the eyes glinted.",
      "Padma stared down at her plate.",
      "\"Hermione wouldn't just do that!\" yelled Mandy\nBrocklehurst, who was practically in tears, in fact she\nwas in tears, her voice would have been loud enough to\nsilence the Great Hall if it hadn't been for all the other students\nalso screaming at each other. \"I - I bet Malfoy tried to - to\ndo things to her -\"",
      "\"Our General would never do that!\" Kevin Entwhistle\nyelled even louder than Mandy.",

      "Both of them were her friends, maybe the two best friends she\nhad.",
      "Padma stared down at her plate. She was glad the Sorting Hat\nhadn't offered her Hufflepuff. If she'd been Sorted into Hufflepuff\nit would probably have been much more painful, trying to decide\nwhere her divided loyalties lay...",
      "She blinked and realized that her vision had gotten blurry\nagain, and raised a trembling hand to wipe once more at her\neyes.",
      "Morag MacDougal snorted so loudly it was audible even amid the\npandemonium of lunch, and said in a loud voice, \"I bet Granger\ncheated in her battle yesterday, I bet that's why Malfoy\nchallenged her -\"",
      "\"All of you SHUT UP!\u202f\" roared Harry Potter, as he hit\nthe table with his fists so hard that plates rattled all the way\nalong it.",
      "At any other time it would have gotten Professors reprimanding\nhim, this time it just got a few nearby students to look.",
      "\"I'd wanted to eat lunch,\" Harry Potter said, \"and then get back\nto investigating, so I wasn't going to talk. But you're all being\nsilly, and when the truth comes out you're going to regret\nwhat you said about innocent people. Draco didn't do anything,\nHermione didn't do anything, they were both False-Memory-Charmed!\"\nHarry Potter's voice had been rising on the last words. \"How is\nthat not BLOODY OBVIOUS?\u202f\"",
      "\"You think we'll believe that?\u202f\" Kevin Entwhistle\nyelled right back at him. \"That's what everyone says! 'I didn't do\nit, it was all just a False Memory Charm!' You think we're\nstupid?\u202f\"",
      "And Morag nodded right along with him, with a condescending\nlook.",
      "The look that came over Harry Potter's face then made Padma\nflinch.",
      "\"I see,\" Harry Potter said, it wasn't a shout so Padma had to\nstrain to hear it. \"Professor Quirrell isn't here to explain to me\nhow stupid people are, but I bet this time I can get it on my own.\nPeople do something dumb and get caught and are given Veritaserum.\nNot romantic master criminals, because they wouldn't get\ncaught, they would have learned Occlumency. Sad, pathetic,\nincompetent criminals get caught, and confess under Veritaserum,\nand they're desperate to stay out of Azkaban so they say they were\nFalse-Memory-Charmed. Right? So your brain, by sheer Pavlovian\nassociation, links the idea of False Memory Charms to pathetic\ncriminals with unbelievable excuses. You don't have to consider the\nspecific details, your brain just pattern-matches the\nhypothesis into a bucket of things you don't believe, and you're\ndone. Just like my father thought that magical hypotheses could\nnever be believed, because he'd heard so many stupid people talking\nabout magic. Believing a hypothesis that involves False Memory\nCharms is low-status.\"",

      "\"And I'm not going to complain,\" Harry Potter said in an eerily\ncalm voice, \"about wizards not having any logic and believing the\ncraziest things. Because I said that to Professor Quirrell once,\nand he just gave me this look and said that if I wasn't\nblinded by my upbringing I could think of a hundred more ridiculous\nthings that lots of Muggles believe. What you're all doing is very\nhuman and very normal and doesn't make you unusually bad\npeople, so I'm not going to complain.\" The Boy-Who-Lived rose up\nfrom his bench. \"I'll see you all later.\"",

A week, a month, maybe even a year,\nwouldn't have sufficed to take the 'examine' option on every item\nin the room. With Professor Flitwick gone, Harry had asked\nProfessor Vector if there was any way to detect damage to the wards\naround the crystal cases, verify the residue that a real duel\nshould have left behind.

Harry had snuck into the\nSlytherin dungeons under the Cloak of Invisibility and spent the\nrest of the afternoon looking through all the obvious places, but\nhe hadn't found anything snaky that answered back when spoken to.\nThe entrance to the Chamber of Secrets, it seemed, hadn't been\nmeant to be found in a day.",

      "The Most Ancient Hall of the Wizengamot is cool and dark, with\nconcentric half-circles of stone rising up from the lowest center,\nand simple wooden benches set down upon those elevated\nhalf-circles. There is no source of light, but the chamber is\nwell-lit, without any apparent cause or reason; it is simply a\nbrute fact that the hall is well-lit. The walls like the floor are\nstone, dark stone, some elegant and mysterious conjugation of rock\nmost fine to gaze upon, with a smooth texture that seems to flow\nand shift beneath its surface. This is the Most Ancient Hall, the\noldest place of wizardry that has lasted into the modern day; every\nother place of power was destroyed in one war or another. This is\nthe Hall of the Wizengamot, which is most ancient because the wars\nended with the building of this place.",
      "This is the Hall of the Wizengamot; there are older places, but\nthey are hidden. Legend holds that the walls of dark stone were\nconjured, created, willed into existence by Merlin, when he\ngathered the most powerful wizards left in the world and awed them\ninto accepting him as their chief. And when (the legend continues)\nthe Seers continued to foretell that not enough had yet been done\nto prevent the end of the world and its magic, then (the story\ngoes) Merlin sacrificed his life, and his wizardry, and his time,\nto lay in force the Interdict of Merlin. It was not an act without\ncost, for a place like this one could not be raised again by any\npower still known to wizardkind. Nor yet destroyed, for those walls\nof dark stone would pass unharmed, and perhaps unwarmed, through\nthe heart of a nuclear explosion. It is a pity that nobody knows\nhow to make them anymore.",
      "In the highest of the rising half-circles of the Wizengamot, on\nthe topmost level of dark stone, there is a podium. At that podium\nstands an old man, with care-lined face and a silver beard that\nstretches down below his waist; this is Albus Percival Wulfric\nBrian Dumbledore. His right hand bears a wand of power, upon his\nshoulder perches a bird of fire. His left hand holds a short rod,\nthin and featureless and forged of the same dark stone as the\nwalls, and this is the Line of Merlin Unbroken, the device of the\nChief Warlock. Karen Dutton bequeathed the Line to Albus Dumbledore\non the last day of her life, scant hours after he returned\nhalf-dead from his defeat of Grindelwald with a phoenix flaming\nbrightly at his side. She in turn received the Line from the\nperfectionist Nicodemus Capernaum, each wizard passing it to their\nchosen successor, back and back in unbroken chain to the day Merlin\nlaid down his life. That (if you were wondering) is how the country\nof magical Britain managed to elect Cornelius Fudge for its\nMinister, and yet end up with Albus Dumbledore for its Chief\nWarlock. Not by law (for written law can be rewritten) but by most\nancient tradition, the Wizengamot does not choose who shall preside\nover its follies. Since the day of Merlin's sacrifice, the most\nimportant duty of any Chief Warlock has been to exercise the\nhighest caution in their choice of people who are both good and\nable to discern good successors. You would expect that chain of\nlight to miss a step, sometime down through the centuries; that it\nwould go astray at least once, and then never return. But it has\nnot. The Line of Merlin continues, unbroken.",
      "(Or so say those of Dumbledore's faction. Lord Malfoy would tell\nyou otherwise. And in Asia they tell other tales entirely, which\nmay not make Britain's version wrong.)",
      "Upon the bottommost platform of the Ancient Hall there is a\nhigh-backed chair, legged and armed and without cushions, of dark\nmetal rather than dark stone, which Merlin did not place there.",
      "The Ministry building that grew up around this place is\nwood-paneled and gold-washed, bright and fire-lit, filled with\nbustling foolishness. This place is different. It is the stone\nheart of magical Britain, and it is neither gold-washed nor\nwood-paneled, neither fire-lit nor bright.",
      "Filing solemnly into this room are witches and wizards in\nplum-colored robes each embroidered with a silver W. They carry\nthemselves with an air of seriousness showing that they are well\naware that they are terribly, terribly important. They are meeting\nin the Most Ancient Hall, after all. They are the Lords and Ladies\nof the Wizengamot, and they consider themselves the greatest folk\nof the world's greatest magical country. Lesser folk have fallen\nbefore them on bended knee in supplication; they are powerful, they\nare wealthy, they are noble; are they not great?",
      "Albus Dumbledore knows everyone in this room by name. He has\ntaught many of them, though too few have learned. Some are his\nallies, some his opponents, the rest he courts within the careful\ndance of their neutrality. All of them, to him, are people.",
      "The current Defense Professor of Hogwarts, if you asked him for\nhis opinion of the Lords and Ladies, would say that while many of\nthem are ambitious, few have any ambition. He would observe that\nthe Wizengamot is exactly where someone like that would end up -\nthat it is exactly the sort of opportunity you would grasp, if you\nhad nothing better to do. Such folk are rarely interesting, but\nthey are often useful; pieces to be manipulated, points to be\nscored, by the true players of the game.",
      "Not among the rising half-circles, but off to one side among a\nraised arc for the spectators, next to a witch in pointed hat whose\nface is lined with apprehension, there sits a boy dressed in the\nmost formal black robes that he owns. His eyes are green ice and\nabstraction, and he hardly glances at the Lords and Ladies as they\nbustle in. To him they are just a collection of murmuring\nplum-colored robes to decorate the wooden benches, visual\nbackground for the scene of the Most Ancient Hall. If there is an\nenemy here, or something to be manipulated, it is merely \"the\nWizengamot\". The wealthy elites of magical Britain have collective\nforce, but not individual agency; their goals are too alien and\ntrivial for them to have personal roles in the tale. As of now,\nthis present time, the boy neither likes nor dislikes the\nplum-colored robes, because his brain does not assign them enough\nagenthood to be the subjects of moral judgment. He is a PC, and\nthey are wallpaper.",
      "This view is about to change.",
      "Harry gazed unseeing around the hall of the Wizengamot; it\nlooked quite old and historic and there was no doubt that Hermione\ncould have lectured him about the place for hours on end. The\nplum-colored robes had stopped arriving, and Harry's pocketwatch,\nadvancing at the rate of three minutes every half-hour, said that\nthe trial was almost due to start.",
      "Professor McGonagall was sitting beside him, and her eyes never\nleft him for more than twenty consecutive seconds.",
      "Harry had read the Daily Prophet that morning. The\nheadline had been \"MAD MUGGLEBORN TRIES TO END ANCIENT LINE\" and\nthe rest of the paper had been the same. When Harry was nine years\nold the IRA had blown up a British barracks, and he'd watched on TV\nas all the politicians contested to see who could be the most\nloudly outraged. And the thought had occurred to Harry - even then,\nbefore he'd known much about psychology - that it looked like\neveryone was competing to see who could be most angry, and\nnobody would've been allowed to suggest that anyone was\nbeing too angry, even if they'd just proposed the\nsaturation nuclear bombing of Ireland. He'd been struck, even then,\nby an essential emptiness in the indignation of politicians -\nthough he hadn't had the words to describe it, at that age - a\nsense that they were trying to score cheap points by hitting at the\nsame safe target as everyone else.",
      "Harry had always possessed that sense of hollowness about\npolitical indignation, but it was strange how very much more\nobvious it seemed, when you were reading a dozen articles in the\nDaily Prophet beating on Hermione Granger.",
      "The leading article, written by some name that Harry didn't\nrecognize, had called for the minimum age for Azkaban to be\nlowered, just so that the twisted mudblood who had defaced the\nhonor of Scotland with her savage, unprovoked attack upon the last\nheir of a Most Ancient House within the sacred refuge of Hogwarts\ncould be sent to the Dementors that were the only punishment\ncommensurate with the severity of her unspeakable crime. Only this\nwould be enough to discourage any other foreign, subhuman brutes\nwho similarly believed in their twisted insanity that they could\nevade the majesty of the Wizengamot's inevitable and merciless\nscourging of all that threatened the honorable nobility of etcetera\netcetera etcetera.",
      "The next article had said the same thing in less eloquent\nwords.",
      "Earlier, Albus Dumbledore had told him,",
      "\"I will not try to keep you from this trial.\" The old\nwizard's voice quiet and unyielding. \"I can well foresee how that\nwould go. But I would have you treat me with equal courtesy in\nreturn. The politics of the Wizengamot are delicate, and of them\nyou know nothing. Dare any folly and it shall be to Hermione\nGranger's cost; and you will remember that folly for the rest of\nyour days, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres.\"",
      "\"I understand,\" Harry said. \"I know. Just - if you're\nplanning to pull a rabbit out of your hat and save the day at the\nlast minute when everything seems lost, please tell me now instead\nof letting me sit and worry -\"",
      "\"I would not do that to you,\" the old wizard said, a\nterrible weariness seeming to suffuse him as he turned to go.\n\"Still less to Hermione. But I have no rabbits in my hat, Harry. We\ncan only see what Lucius Malfoy wants.\"",
      "There was a small sharp rap, a single brief sound that somehow\nsilenced the entire room and caused Harry's head to jerk around and\nupward. High above, Dumbledore had just tapped his podium with the\ndark rod he held in his left hand.",
      "\"The ninetieth session of the two-hundred-and-eighth Wizengamot\nis convened at the request of Lord Lucius Malfoy,\" the old wizard\nsaid tonelessly.",
      "At once, far to the side of the podium but also in the highest\ncircle, rose a tall man with a mane of long white spilling down\nfrom his head over the shoulders of his plum-colored robes. \"I\npresent a witness for questioning under Veritaserum,\" Lucius Malfoy\nsaid, his cool tone clear throughout the room, smoothly controlled\nwith only a slight undertone of righteous fury. \"Let Hermione, the\nfirst Granger, be brought forth.\"",
      "\"I ask you all to remember that she is a first-year of\nHogwarts,\" Dumbledore said. \"I will brook no abuse of this witness\n-\"",
      "Someone in the benches quite audibly said \"Pfah!\" and there was\na spread of disgusted snorts, even one or two jeers.",
      "Harry stared at the plum-colored robes, his eyes narrowing.",
      "And with the growing anger came something else, a rising sense\nof disquiet, of something horribly skewed, like reality itself was\nbeing disrupted. Harry knew that, somehow, but he couldn't figure\nout what was awry, or why his mind thought it was getting\nworse...",
      "\"Order!\u202f\" Dumbledore bellowed. He rapped the stone rod\ntwice against the podium, producing two more small clicks that\noverrode all noise. \"I will have order here!\"",
      "The door through which the witness was brought forth was set\ndirectly beneath Harry's own seat, so it wasn't until the entire\ngroup had emerged fully into the stone hall that Harry saw -",
      "- an Auror trio -",
      "- Hermione's back was to Harry as she was brought out, he\ncouldn't see her face -",
      "- followed by a shining silver sparrow and a running moonlit\nsquirrel -",
      "- and the source of the horrible wrongness, half-hidden beneath\na tattered cloak.",
      "Harry shot to his feet before he could even think, it was only\nProfessor McGonagall's sudden frantic grab on his wrist that\nstopped his hand going for his wand; and the Transfiguration\nProfessor whispered desperately, \"Harry it's all right there's\na Patronus -\"",
      "It took a few seconds for Harry to remember himself. For the\npart of himself that understood that Hermione hadn't been directly\nexposed to a Dementor, to argue his other parts into something like\nsanity -",
      "But animal Patronuses aren't perfect, said another\nvoice inside his mind. Or Dumbledore wouldn't see the form of a\nnaked man painful to look upon. You felt it approaching, animal\nPatronus or no...",
      "Slowly, Harry Potter sat back down again as Professor McGonagall\npulled down with her grip on his wrist.",
      "But by then he'd already declared war on the country of magical\nBritain, and the idea of other people calling him a Dark Lord no\nlonger seemed important one way or another.",
      "Hermione's face became visible to him, as she sat down in the\nchair. She wasn't upright and defiant like she'd been in front of\nSnape, she wasn't crying like she'd been when the Aurors arrested\nher. She just sat there with a look of vacant horror as dark metal\nchains snaked out from the chair and bound her arms and legs.",
      "Harry couldn't take it. Without even thinking he was trying to\nflee inside himself, flee into his dark side, pull the cold rage\nover himself like a shield. It took too long, he hadn't tried to go\nfully into his dark side since Azkaban. And then when his blood was\nsomething like cold, he looked up again, and saw Hermione in the\nchair again, and discovered that his dark side knew nothing about\nhow to deal with this type of pain, it pierced through the coldness\nlike a knife and didn't hurt less in the slightest.",
      "\"Why, if it isn't Harry Potter!\" came a high, light female\nvoice, sickly sweet and indulgent.",
      "Slowly, Harry turned his head away from the chair and saw a\nsmiling woman wearing so much makeup that her skin looked almost\npink, sitting next to a man that Harry recognized from photographs\nas Minister Cornelius Fudge.",
      "\"Did you have something to say, Mr. Potter?\" inquired the woman,\nas cheerfully as if this wasn't a trial.",
      "Other people were also looking at him now.",
      "Harry couldn't speak, all the words in his mind would have been\nstupid to speak aloud. He couldn't find anything to say that\nNeville could also have said. Dumbledore had warned Harry that if\nanyone else wanted the Boy-Who-Lived to speak, he must\npretend to be his age -",
      "\"The Headmaster said I shouldn't ought to talk,\" the boy said,\nnot quite able to keep the edge out of his voice.",
      "\"Oh, but you have our permission to talk!\" the woman\nsaid brightly. \"I'm sure the Wizengamot is always happy to hear\nfrom the Boy-Who-Lived!\" Beside her, Minister Cornelius Fudge was\nnodding.",
      "The woman's face was puffy and overweight, visibly pale beneath\nthe makeup. Almost inevitably, a certain word came to mind, and\nthat word was toad. Which, said Harry's logical part,\nshouldn't correlate to morality in any way. Only in Disney movies\nwere ugly people more likely to be evil and vice versa; and those\nmovies were probably scripted by writers who'd never been ugly.\nHe'd give her a chance, everyone in this room deserved one\nchance...",
      "\"Because I got rid of the Dark Lord?\" the boy said, and pointed\nat the Dementor where it was hovering behind Hermione's chair.\n\"There's something in this room that's Darker.\"",
      "The woman's face narrowed, growing a little stern. \"I realize a\nyoung boy like yourself may be scared by them, Mr. Potter, but the\nDementors are quite obedient to the Ministry of Magic. And they\nwould, of course, be necessary to guard -\"",
      "\"A twelve-year-old girl?\" the boy yelled. \"Those are the Darkest\ncreatures in the whole world, I could feel it coming here even\nthrough the Patronus - the wrongness coming nearer - it's\nhorribly evil and it - it'd eat everyone in this room, if it could!\nIt shouldn't be let near any child, ever! Not me, not her, not\nanyone! You ought to vote to send it away!\"",
      "\"We'll certainly have no such vote -\" the toad-woman\nsnapped.",
      "\"That's enough, Madam Umbridge, Mr. Potter,\" came Dumbledore's\nstern voice from high above. And then after a short pause, the old\nwizard went on, \"Although, of course, the boy is correct on every\ncount.\"",
      "Some of the members of the Wizengamot were looking abashed at\nthe Boy-Who-Lived's admonition, and a few others were nodding\nviolently to the old wizard's words. But they were too few. Harry\ncould see it. They were too few.",
      "The Veritaserum was brought in then, and Hermione looked for a\nbrief moment like she was about to sob, she was looking at\nHarry - no, at Professor McGonagall - and Professor McGonagall was\nmouthing words that Harry couldn't make out from his angle. Then\nHermione swallowed three drops of Veritaserum and her face grew\nslack.",
      "\"Gawain Robards,\" said the smooth voice of Lucius Malfoy. \"Your\nprobity is known to all of us. If you would do the honors?\"",
      "One of the three Aurors stepped forward.",
      "After the first few questions Harry looked away and stared off\nto one side with his fingers in his ears, as Hermione's brain\nplayed back the contents of the False Memory Charm. He couldn't\nhandle the drug-dulled anguish in Hermione's voice as she recounted\nthe false memories, and his dark side couldn't handle it either,\nand he'd already heard the contents summarized.",
      "Harry's mind flashed back to another day of horror, and even\nthough Harry had been on the verge of writing off Lord Voldemort's\ncontinued existence as the senility of an old wizard, it suddenly\nseemed horribly and uniquely plausible that the entity who'd\nMemory-Charmed Hermione was the very same mind that had - made\nuse of - Bellatrix Black. The two events had a certain\nsignature in common. To choose that this should happen,\nplan for this to happen - it would take more than evil, it\nwould take emptiness.",
      "Harry looked up for a moment, then, and saw that the\nplum-colored robes were watching, just watching.",
      "Some time later, after all the stars in the night sky had gone\ncold and dark and the last light in the Universe had sputtered down\nto embers and gone black, the questioning of Hermione ended.",
      "\"If it pleases my Lords,\" said the voice of Lord Malfoy, \"I\nshould like to have the testimony of my son Draco, witnessed under\ntwo drops of Veritaserum, read aloud at this time.\"",
      "Until she went after me in that battle, I wasn't plotting\nanything against Granger. But after that day I really was feeling\ninsulted, I'd helped her all those times -",
      "The sound that came from Hermione's throat was like she'd just\nbeen crushed under a falling stone, so huge that she couldn't cry\nor breathe, just a small sad gasp.",
      "\"Pardon me,\" said one witch from what seemed to be the\nMalfoy-aligned side of the room. \"But Lord Malfoy, why would your\nson help this mudblood girl?\"",
      "\"My son,\" Lucius Malfoy said in a heavy voice, \"seems to have\nbeen listening to certain misguided ideas. He is young - and he has\nlearned, now, we have all seen as a country, what such folly brings\nin repayment.\"",
      "A few steps down along the visitor's benches, a man wearing a\nnewsman's cap and a badge identifying him as belonging to the\nDaily Prophet was avidly scribbling with a long quill.",
      "The few people who'd nodded along to Dumbledore earlier had\nrather sick looks on their faces. One witch in plum-colored robes\nquite deliberately stood up from what had seemed like Dumbledore's\nside of the room, and made her way over toward the Malfoy side.",
      "The Auror went on reading, his voice monotone.",
      "I'd been so tired from casting all those locking wards, I\nwas weak when I cast the last one. I thought I was stronger than\nGranger but I wasn't certain, so I tested it empirically by\nchallenging her to a duel, that's why I d-d-did it and also because\nif I'd won I was planning to beat her again the next day where\neveryone could see. Stupid Veritaserum. But she didn't\nknow about that when she tried to kill me! And I really\nwas insulted by what she'd done, I really had helped her before and\nI hadn't been planning anything against her then, only she\nwent after me in front of everyone!\"",
      "When all the witness testimony was done, the deliberations of\nthe Wizengamot began.",
      "If you could call them that.",
      "It seemed that many members of the Wizengamot were of the strong\nopinion that murder was bad.",
      "The plum-colored robes on Dumbledore's side of the room were\nsilent, the supposed forces of good saving their political capital\nfor more winnable battles. And Harry could hear, as though\nProfessor Quirrell were standing next to him, a dry voice in his\nmind; explaining to him that it would hardly have been to the\npoliticians' own advantage to speak, just then.",
      "But there was one wizard in the room whose status was high\nenough that he had, it seemed, transcended his caution against\nlosing face; one wizard alone whose status was high enough that he\ncould speak a word of sanity and escape unscathed. He alone spoke\nto defend Hermione, the man with a phoenix flaming bright upon his\nshoulder.",
      "Only Albus Dumbledore spoke.",
      "The Chief Warlock didn't raise the possibility that Hermione\nGranger was entirely innocent. That, the Headmaster had explained\nto Harry, would not be believed, would only make it worse.",
      "But Albus Dumbledore said, in one gentle reminder after another,\nthat the perpetrator was a first-year girl in Hogwarts; that many\nhad done foolish things during their youth; that a first-year in\nHogwarts was simply too young to comprehend the consequences of her\nacts. He himself (the Chief Warlock said quietly) had attempted\ncertain foolish things during his childhood, when he was well older\nthan she.",
      "Albus Dumbledore said that Hermione Granger had been beloved of\nall the Hogwarts faculty, and helped four Hufflepuff girls with\ntheir Charms homework, and had scored one hundred and three points\nfor Ravenclaw over the course of the school year.",
      "Albus Dumbledore said that nobody who knew Hermione Granger\nwould be anything but shocked by these events. That they had, all\nof them, heard the horror in her voice as she recounted her\ntestimony. And if some unusual madness had temporarily possessed\nher, then - his voice rising in stern command - she deserved\nnothing from them except sympathy and a healer's attentions.",
      "And at the last, Albus Dumbledore reminded the Wizengamot, over\ncries of protest, that the charge was attempted murder and\nnot murder. Albus Dumbledore said, over a rising storm of\nobjections, that no lasting harm had come to anyone. And Albus\nDumbledore begged them not to do worse themselves than anything\nthat had yet been done -",
      "\"Enough!\u202f\" bellowed Lucius Malfoy, and a show of hands\nended the deliberations. The white-maned man stood tall and\nterrible, his silver cane held high in one hand like a gavel about\nto fall. \"For what this mad woman has tried to do to my son - for\nthe blood debt that she owes for trying to end the line of a Noble\nand Most Ancient House - I say that she will -\"",
      "\"Azkaban!\" roared a man with a scarred face, seated at Lord\nMalfoy's right hand. \"Send the mad mudblood to Azkaban!\"",
      "\"Azkaban!\" cried another plum-colored robe, and then another,\nand another -",
      "A click from the rod in Dumbledore's hand silenced the room.\n\"You are out of order,\" the old wizard said sternly. \"And your\nproposal is barbaric, beneath the dignity of this assembly. There\nare things we do not do. Lord Malfoy?\"",
      "Lucius Malfoy had listened to this with an impassive face.\n\"Well,\" Lord Malfoy said after a few moments. A cold gleam lit his\neyes. \"I had not planned to ask it. But if that is the will of the\nWizengamot - then let her pay as any in her place would pay. Let it\nbe Azkaban.\"",
      "A great cheer of rage went up -",
      "\"Are you all lost?\u202f\" cried Albus Dumbledore. \"She is\ntoo young! Her mind would not withstand it! Not in three centuries\nhas such a thing been done in Britain!\"",
      "\"What will the other countries think of us?\" said the sharp\nvoice of a woman that Harry recognized as Neville's\ngrandmother.",
      "\"Will you guard Azkaban after she goes there, Lord\nMalfoy?\" said a stern old witch that Harry didn't know. \"For my\nAurors may decline to guard it, I fear, if small children are kept\nwithin.\"",
      "\"The deliberations are ended,\" Lucius Malfoy said coldly. \"But\nif you are incapable of finding Aurors who can obey the vote of the\nWizengamot, Madam Bones, you may relinquish the position; we can\neasily find another to serve in your place. The will of this Hall\nis clear. For the monstrosity of her crimes, the girl is to be\ntried as an adult and punished accordingly; ten years in Azkaban,\nthe justice for attempted murder.\"",
      "When the old wizard spoke again, his voice was lower. \"Is there\nno alternative to this, Lucius? We may retire to my chambers to\ndiscuss it, if need be.\"",
      "The tall man of the long white hair turned, then, to regard\nwhere the old wizard stood at the podium; and the two stared at\neach other for a long moment.",
      "When Lucius Malfoy spoke again his voice seemed to tremble ever\nso slightly, as though the stern control on it was failing. \"Blood\ncalls for repayment, the blood of my family. Not for any price will\nI sell the blood debt owed my son. You would not understand that,\nwho never had love or child of your own. Still, there is more than\none debt owed to House Malfoy, and I think that my son, if he stood\namong us, would rather be repaid for his mother's blood than for\nhis own. Confess your own crime to the Wizengamot, as you confessed\nit to me, and I shall -\"",
      "\"Don't even think about it, Albus,\" said the stern old witch who\nhad spoken before.",
      "The old wizard stood at the podium.",
      "The old wizard stood at the podium, his face twisting,\nuntwisting -",
      "\"Stop it,\" said the old witch. \"You know the answer you must\ngive, Albus. It will not change for agonizing over it.\"",
      "The old wizard spoke.",
      "\"No,\" said Albus Dumbledore.",
      "\"And you, Malfoy,\" continued the stern old witch, \"I suppose all\nyou really wanted this whole time was to ruin -\"",
      "\"Hardly,\" said Lucius Malfoy, his lips now twisting into a\nbitter smile. \"No, I have no purpose here but my son's vengeance. I\nonly wished to show the Wizengamot the truth behind this old man's\npretended heroism and his praise of that girl - that he would\nhardly think of sacrificing himself to save her.\"",
      "\"Cruelty worthy of a Death Eater indeed,\" said Augusta\nLongbottom. \"Not that I'm implying anything, of course.\"",
      "\"Cruelty?\" said Lucius Malfoy, the bitter smile still on his\nface. \"I think not. I knew what his answer would be. I have ever\nwarned you that he only plays his pretended part. If you believe in\nhis hesitation, the more fool you. Remember that his answer was the\nsame.\" The man raised his voice. \"Let us vote, my friends. I think\na show of hands will suffice for it. I do not imagine there will be\nmany who choose to align themselves with murderers.\" The voice went\ncold, on the last note, the promise in it very clear.",
      "\"Look at the girl,\" said Albus Dumbledore. \"See her, see the\nhorror you are committing! She is -\" The old wizard's voice broke.\n\"She is afraid -\"",
      "The Veritaserum must have been wearing off, because Hermione\nGranger's face was twisting beneath the slackness, her limbs\ntrembling visibly beneath the chains, as though she were trying to\nrun, run from that chair, but was pressed down by weights larger\nthan the enchanted metal links that bound her. Then there was a\nconvulsive effort and Hermione's neck moved, her head twisted,\nenough to bring her eyes into line -",
      "She looked at Harry Potter and though she didn't speak, it was\nabsolutely clear what she was saying.",
      "Harry",
      "help me",
      "please -",
      "And in the Most Ancient Hall of the Wizengamot an icy voice rang\nout, speech the color of liquid nitrogen, pitched too high for that\nit came from too young a throat, and that voice said, \"Lucius\nMalfoy.\"",
      "In the ancient and hallowed halls of the Wizengamot, people\nlooked around and it took their eyes too long to find what they\nsought. It might have been high in pitch, it might have been\nunder-loud for the words being spoken; and yet even so, you\nwouldn't have expected to hear that voice from a child.",
      "It wasn't until Lord Malfoy spoke in return that people even\nrealized where they should be looking.",
      "\"Harry Potter,\" said Lucius Malfoy. He did not incline his\nhead.",
      "Heads spun, eyes moved, and people focused on the messy-haired\nyoung boy standing near the weeping older witch. The boy stood\nmerely chest-high with his shoes on, dressed in short robes of\nformal black. Though unless your eyes were keen indeed, you\ncouldn't have seen, from all the way across the Hall, that famous\nand deadly scar beneath his messy hair.",
      "\"This folly does not become you, Lucius,\" said the boy.\n\"Twelve-year-old girls do not go around committing murders. You are\na Slytherin and an intelligent one. You know this is a plot.\nHermione Granger was placed on this gameboard by force, by whatever\nhand lies behind that plot. You were surely intended to\nact just as you are acting now - except that Draco Malfoy was meant\nto be dead, and you were meant to be beyond all reason. But he is\nalive and you are sane. Why are you cooperating with your intended\nrole, in a plot meant to take the life of your son?\"",
      "A storm seemed to be raging inside Lucius, the face beneath the\nflowing white hair threatening to crack open and spill something\nunguessable. The Lord of Malfoy seemed to almost speak once and\nthen twice again, swallowing three unheard sentences before his\nlips parted for true. \"A plot, you say?\" Lord Malfoy said at last.\nHis face was twitching, hardly controlled. \"And whose plot would\nthat be, then?\"",
      "\"If I knew,\" said the boy, \"I would have said so a good deal\nearlier. But anyone who had ever been Hermione Granger's classmate\ncould tell you that she is a most unlikely murderess. She does, in\nfact, help Hufflepuffs with their homework. This was not a natural\nevent, Lord Malfoy.\"",
      "\"Plot - or no plot -\" Lucius's voice was trembling. \"This\nmudblood filth has touched my son and for that I will end her. You\nshould know that full well, Harry Potter.\"",
      "\"It is questionable,\" the boy said, \"to put it mildly, whether\nHermione Granger actually cast that Blood-Cooling Charm. I do not\nknow the exact circumstances or what spells were involved, but\nsimple trickery would not have sufficed to make her do it. She did\nnot act of her own will, and perhaps did not act at all. Your\nvengeance is being misdirected, Lord Malfoy, and deliberately so.\nIt is not a twelve-year-old girl who deserves your ire.\"",
      "\"And what do you care for her fate?\" Lucius Malfoy's\nvoice was rising. \"What is your stake in this?\"",
      "\"She is my friend,\" the boy said, \"as Draco is my friend. It is\npossible that this blow was aimed at me, and not at House Malfoy at\nall.\"",
      "Again the muscles jumped in Lucius's face. \"And now you are\nlying to me - as you lied to my son!\"",
      "\"Believe it or not,\" the boy said quietly, \"I never willed\nanything but that Draco should know the truth -\"",
      "\"Enough!\u202f\" cried the Lord Malfoy. \"Enough of your lies!\nEnough of your games! You do not understand - you would\nnever understand - what it means that he is my son! I will not be\ndenied this vengeance! No more! Never again! For the blood this\ngirl owes House Malfoy, she shall go to Azkaban. And if I ever find\nanother hand at work - even if it is your own - that hand shall be\ncut off as well!\" Lucius Malfoy raised his deadly silver cane as\nthough in command, his teeth clenched and his lips drawn back in a\nsnarl, like a wolf facing a dragon. \"And if you have nothing better\nto say than that - be silent, Harry Potter!\"",
      "Harry's blood was hammering even beneath the ice of his dark\nside, the fear for Hermione, the part of him that wanted to lash\nout at Lucius and destroy him where he stood for his insolence and\nhis stupidity - but Harry didn't have the power,\nhe didn't even have a single vote in the Wizengamot -",
      "Draco had said that Lucius was scared of him, for some unknown\nreason. And Harry could see it in the rictus that Lord Malfoy's\nface had become, drawn and tight, that it was taking all his\ncourage for him to tell Harry to shut up.",
      "So Harry said, his voice cool and deadly, hoping to hell that it\nmeant something, \"You will earn my enmity if you do this thing,\nLucius...\"",
      "Someone in the lower rows of what was evidently the blood-purist\nside of the Wizengamot, who was looking down at the young boy\nrather than up at Lord Malfoy, laughed in outright incredulity.\nOther plum-colored robes began to laugh as well.",
      "Lord Malfoy gazed at him with hard dignity, as that laughter\nspread. \"If you want the enmity of the House of Malfoy, you shall\nhave it, child.\"",
      "\"Now really,\" said the woman in too much pink makeup, \"I think\nthis has gone on quite long enough, wouldn't you say, Lord Malfoy?\nThe boy will miss his classes.\"",
      "\"Indeed he will,\" said Lucius Malfoy, and then raised his voice\nagain. \"I call the vote! By show of hands, let the Wizengamot\nacknowledge the blood debt owed to the Noble and Most Ancient House\nof Malfoy, for the attempted murder of its last scion and ending of\nits line, by Hermione, the first Granger!\"",
      "Hands shot up one after another, and the secretary who sat in\nthe bottom circle began to make marks on parchment to tally them,\nbut it was obvious which way the majority had gone.",
      "And Harry screamed inside his mind, a frantic call for help to\nany part of himself that would offer a way out, a strategy, an\nidea. But there was nothing, there was nothing, he'd played his\nlast cards and lost. And then with a last convulsive desperation\nHarry plunged himself into his dark side, pushed himself into his\ndark side, seizing at its deadly clarity, offering his dark side\nanything if it would only solve this problem for him; and at last\nthe lethal calm came over him, the true ice finally answering his\ncall. Beyond all panic and despair his mind began to search through\nevery fact in its possession, recall everything it knew about\nLucius Malfoy, about the Wizengamot, about the laws of magical\nBritain; his eyes looked at the rows of chairs, at every person and\nevery thing within range of his vision, searching for any\nopportunity it could grasp -"

      "In rising half-circles of dark stone, a great sea of upraised\nhands.",
      "The Lords and Ladies of the Wizengamot, in plum-colored robes\nmarked with a silver 'W', stared down in stern rebuke at a young\ngirl trembling in chains. If they had, in any particular ethical\nsystem, damned themselves, they clearly thought quite highly of\nthemselves for having done so.",
      "Harry's breath was trembling in his chest. His dark side had\ncome up with a plan - and then rotated itself back out again\nbecause speaking too icily would not be to Hermione's advantage; a\nfact which the only-half-cold Harry had somehow not realized...",
      "\"The vote carries, in favor,\" intoned the secretary, when all\nthe tallying was done, and the upraised hands fell back down. \"The\nWizengamot recognizes the blood debt owed by Hermione Granger to\nHouse Malfoy for the attempted murder of its scion and ending of\nits line.\"",
      "Lucius Malfoy was smiling in grim satisfaction. \"And now,\" said\nthe white-maned wizard, \"I say that her debt shall be paid -\"",
      "Harry clenched his fists beneath the bench and shouted, \"By the\ndebt owed from House Malfoy to House Potter!\"",
      "\"Silence!\" snapped the woman in too much pink makeup sitting\nnext to Minister Fudge. \"You've disrupted these proceedings quite\nenough already! Aurors, escort him out!\"",
      "\"Wait,\" said Augusta Longbottom from the top tier of seats.\n\"What debt is this?\"",
      "Lucius's hands whitened on his cane. \"House Malfoy owes no debt\nto you!\"",
      "It wasn't the world's most solid hope, it was based on one\nnewspaper article from a woman who'd been False-Memory-Charmed, but\nRita Skeeter had seemed to find it plausible, that Mr. Weasley had\nallegedly owed James Potter a debt because...",
      "\"I'm surprised you've forgotten,\" Harry said evenly. \"Surely it\nwas a cruel and painful period of your life, laboring under the\nImperius curse of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, until you were freed of\nit by the efforts of House Potter. By my mother, Lily Potter, who\ndied for it, and by my father, James Potter, who died for it, and\nby me, of course.\"",
      "There was a brief silence within the Most Ancient Hall.",
      "\"Why, what an excellent point, Mr. Potter,\" said the old witch\nwho'd been identified as Madam Bones. \"I, too, am quite surprised\nthat Lord Malfoy would forget such a significant event. It must\nhave been such a happy day for him.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" said Augusta Longbottom. \"He must have been so\ngrateful.\"",
      "Madam Bones nodded. \"House Malfoy could not possibly deny that\ndebt - unless, perhaps, Lord Malfoy is to tell us that he has\nmisremembered something? I should take quite a professional\ninterest in that. We are always trying to improve our picture of\nthose dark days.\"",
      "Lucius Malfoy's hands gripped the silver snake-handle of his\ncane like he was about to strike with it, unleash whatever power it\nkept -",
      "Then the Lord Malfoy seemed to relax, and a chill smile came\nover his face. \"Of course,\" he said easily. \"I do confess I had not\nunderstood, but the child is quite correct. But I do not quite\nthink the two debts cancel - House Potter was only trying to save\nitself, after all -\"",
      "\"Not so,\" Dumbledore said from above.",
      "\"- and therefore,\" intoned Lucius Malfoy, \"I demand monetary\ncompensation as well, for the redemption of the blood debt owed my\nson. That, too, is the law.\"",
      "Harry felt a strange inward flinch. That had also been in the\nnewspaper article, Mr. Weasley had demanded an additional ten\nthousand Galleons -",
      "\"How much?\" said the Boy-Who-Lived.",
      "Lucius was still wearing the cold smile. \"One hundred thousand\nGalleons. If you have not that much in your vault, I suppose I must\naccept a promissory note for the remainder.\"",
      "A roar of protest went up from Dumbledore's side of the room,\neven some of the plum-colored robes in the middle looked\nshocked.",
      "\"Shall we put it to vote of the Wizengamot?\" said Lucius Malfoy.\n\"I think few of us would like to see the little murderess go free.\nBy a show of hands, that additional compensation of one hundred\nthousand Galleons would be required to cancel the debt!\"",
      "The clerk began tallying, but that vote was also clear.",
      "Harry stood there, breathing deeply.",
      "You'd better not even have to think about this, Harry's\ninner Gryffindor said threateningly.",
      "It's a major purchase, observed Ravenclaw. We ought\nto spend a lot of time thinking about it.",
      "It shouldn't have been hard. It shouldn't have. Two\nmillion pounds was only money, and money was only worth what it\ncould buy...",
      "It was strange how much psychological attachment you could have\nto 'only money', or how painful it could be to imagine losing a\nbank vault full of gold that you hadn't even imagined existed just\none year earlier.",
      "Kimball Kinnison wouldn't hesitate, said Gryffindor.\nSeriously. Like, snap decision. What sort of hero are you? I\nalready hate you just for having to think about it for longer than\n50 milliseconds.",
      "This is real life, said Ravenclaw. Losing all your\nmoney is a lot more painful for real people in real life than in\nheroic books.",
      "What? demanded Gryffindor. Whose side are you\non?",
      "I wasn't advocating for a particular answer, said\nRavenclaw, I was just saying it because it was true.",
      "Could a hundred thousand Galleons be used to save more than\none life if spent some other way? said Slytherin. We have\nresearch to do, battles to fight, the difference between being\n40,000 Galleons rich and being 60,000 Galleons in debt is not\ntrivial -",
      "So we'll just use one of our ways to make money fast and\nearn it all back, said Hufflepuff.",
      "It's not certain those will work, said Slytherin,\nand a lot of them require starting cash -",
      "Personally, said Gryffindor, I vote that we save\nHermione and then gang up and kill our inner Slytherin.",
      "The clerk's voice said that the tally had been recorded and the\nvote had passed...",
      "Harry's lips opened.",
      "\"I accept your offer,\" said Harry's lips, without any\nhesitation, without any decision having been made; just as if the\ninternal debate had been pretense and illusion, the true controller\nof the voice having been no part of it.",
      "Lucius Malfoy's mask of calm shattered, his eyes widened, he\nstared at Harry in sheer blank astonishment. His mouth had opened\nslightly, though he wasn't speaking, and if he was making any\npeculiar noises it couldn't be heard over the roar of simultaneous\ngasps from the Wizengamot -",
      "A tap of stone silenced the crowd.",
      "\"No,\" said the voice of Dumbledore.",
      "Harry's head jerked around to stare at the ancient wizard.",
      "Dumbledore's lined face was pale, the silver beard was visibly\ntrembling, he looked like he was in the final throes of a terminal\nillness. \"I'm - sorry, Harry - but this choice is not yours - for I\nam still the guardian of your vault.\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" said Harry, too shocked to compose his\nreply.",
      "\"I cannot let you go into debt to Lucius Malfoy, Harry! I\ncannot! You do not know - you do not realize -\"",
      "DIE.",
      "Harry didn't even know which part of himself had spoken, it\nmight have been a unanimous vote, the pure rage and fury pouring\nthrough him. For an instant he thought that the sheer force of the\nanger might take magical wing and fly out to strike the Headmaster,\nsend him tumbling back dead from the podium -",
      "But when that mental voice had spoken, the old wizard was still\nstanding there, gazing at Harry, long dark wand in his right hand,\nshort black rod in his left.",
      "And Harry's eyes also went to the red-golden bird with its claws\nresting on the shoulder of Dumbledore's black robes, silent when no\nphoenix should have been silent. \"Fawkes,\" Harry said, his voice\nsounding strange in his own ears, \"can you scream at him for\nme?\"",
      "The fiery bird on the old wizard's shoulder didn't scream. Maybe\nthe Wizengamot had demanded that a spell of silence be put on the\ncreature, otherwise it probably would have been screaming the whole\ntime. But Fawkes hit his master, one golden wing buffeting the old\nwizard's head.",
      "\"I cannot, Harry!\" the old wizard said, the agony clear in his\nvoice. \"I am doing as I must do!\"",
      "And Harry knew, then, as he looked at the red-golden bird, what\nhe had to do as well. It should have been obvious from the\nbeginning, that solution.",
      "\"Then I too will do what I must,\" Harry said up to Dumbledore,\nas though the two of them stood alone in the room. \"You do realize\nthat, don't you?\"",
      "The old wizard shook his trembling head. \"You will change your\nmind when you are older -\"",
      "\"I'm not talking about that,\" Harry said, his voice still\nstrange in his own ears. \"I mean that I will not allow Hermione\nGranger to be eaten by Dementors under any circumstances. Period.\nRegardless of what any law says, and no matter what I have to do to\nstop it. Do I still need to spell it out?\"",
      "A strange male voice spoke from somewhere far away, \"Be sure\nthat the girl is taken directly to Azkaban, and put under extra\nguard.\"",
      "Harry waited, staring at the old wizard, and then spoke again.\n\"I will go to Azkaban,\" Harry said to the old wizard, as though\nthey stood alone in the world, \"before Hermione can be taken there,\nand start snapping my fingers. It may cost me my life, but by the\ntime she gets there, there won't be an Azkaban anymore.\"",
      "Some members of the Wizengamot gasped in surprise.",
      "Then a greater number started laughing.",
      "\"How would you even get there, little boy?\" someone said, from\namong those who were laughing.",
      "\"I have my ways of going places,\" said the boy's distant voice.\nHarry kept his eyes on Dumbledore, on the old wizard staring at him\nin shock. Harry didn't look directly at Fawkes, didn't give his\nplan away; but in his mind he prepared to summon the phoenix to\ntransport him, prepared to fill his mind with light and fury, to\ncall for the fire-bird with all his might, he might have to do it\nupon the instant if Dumbledore pointed his wand -",
      "\"Would you truly?\" the old wizard said to Harry, also as if the\ntwo of them stood alone in the room.",
      "The room went silent again as everyone stared in shock at the\nChief Warlock of the Wizengamot, who seemed to be taking the mad\nthreat completely seriously.",
      "The old wizard's eyes were locked only on Harry. \"Would you risk\neverything - everything - only for her?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry said back in reply.",
      "That's the wrong answer, you know, said Slytherin.\nSeriously.",
      "But it's the true answer.",
      "\"You will not see reason?\" said the old wizard.",
      "\"Apparently not,\" Harry said back.",
      "The gazes stayed locked.",
      "\"This is terrible folly,\" said the old wizard.",
      "\"I am aware of this,\" answered the hero. \"Now get out of my\nway.\"",
      "Strange light glinted in the ancient blue eyes. \"As you will,\nHarry Potter, but know that this is not over.\"",
      "The rest of the world faded back into existence.",
      "\"I withdraw my objection,\" said the old wizard, \"Harry Potter\nmay do as he wishes,\" and the Wizengamot exploded in a roar of\nshock, only to be silenced by a final tap of the stone rod.",
      "Harry turned his head back to look at Lord Malfoy, who looked\nlike he'd seen a cat turn into a person and start eating other\ncats. To call the look confused did not begin to describe it.",
      "\"You would truly...\" Lucius Malfoy said slowly. \"You would truly\npay a hundred thousand Galleons, to save one mudblood girl.\"",
      "\"I think there's about forty thousand in my Gringotts vault,\"\nHarry said. It was strange how that was still causing more\ninternal pain than the thought of taking an over-fifty-percent risk\nto his life to destroy Azkaban. \"As for the other sixty thousand -\nwhat are the rules, exactly?\"",
      "\"It comes due when you graduate Hogwarts,\" the old wizard said\nfrom high above. \"But Lord Malfoy has certain rights over you\nbefore then, I fear.\"",
      "Lucius Malfoy stood motionless, frowning down at Harry. \"Who is\nshe to you, then? What is she to you, that you would pay\nso much to keep her from harm?\"",
      "\"My friend,\" the boy said quietly.",
      "Lucius Malfoy's eyes narrowed. \"By the report I received, you\ncannot cast the Patronus Charm, and Dumbledore knows this. The\npower of a single Dementor nearly killed you. You would not dare\nventure near Azkaban in your own person -\"",
      "\"That was in January,\" said Harry. \"This is April.\"",
      "Lucius Malfoy's eyes remained cool and calculating. \"You pretend\nyou can destroy Azkaban, and Dumbledore pretends to believe\nit.\"",
      "Harry did not reply.",
      "The white-haired man turned slightly, toward the center of the\nhalf-circle, as though to address the greater Wizengamot. \"I\nwithdraw my offer!\" shouted the Lord of Malfoy. \"I will not accept\nthe debt to House Potter in payment, not even for a hundred\nthousand Galleons! The girl's blood debt to House Malfoy\nstands!\"",
      "Again the roar of many voices. \"Dishonorable!\" someone cried.\n\"You acknowledge the debt to House Potter, and yet you would -\" and\nthen that voice cut off.",
      "\"I acknowledge the debt, but the law does not strictly oblige me\nto accept it in cancellation,\" said Lord Malfoy with a grim smile.\n\"The girl is no part of House Potter; the debt I owe House Potter\nis no debt to her. As for the dishonor -\" Lucius Malfoy\npaused. \"As for the grave shame I feel at my ingratitude toward the\nPotters, who have done so much for me -\" Lucius Malfoy bowed his\nhead. \"May my ancestors forgive me.\"",
      "\"Well, boy?\" called the scarred man sitting at Lord Malfoy's\nright hand. \"Go and destroy Azkaban, then!\"",
      "\"I'd like to see that,\" said another voice. \"Will you be selling\ntickets?\"",
      "It went without saying that Harry didn't pick this particular\nmoment to give up.",
      "The girl is no part of House Potter -",
      "He had, in fact, seen the obvious way out of the dilemma almost\ninstantly.",
      "It might have taken him longer if he hadn't recently overheard a\nnumber of conversations between older Ravenclaw girls, and read a\ncertain number of Quibbler stories.",
      "He was, nonetheless, having trouble accepting it.",
      "This is ridiculous, said a part of Harry which had just\ndubbed itself the Internal Consistency Checker. Our actions\nhere are completely incoherent. First you feel less emotional\nreluctance to risk your bloody LIFE and probably DIE for Hermione,\nthan to part with a stupid heap of gold. And now you're balking\njust at getting married?",
      "SYSTEM ERROR.",
      "You know what? said Internal Consistency Checker.\nYou're stupid.",
      "I didn't say no, thought Harry. I was just saying\nSYSTEM ERROR.",
      "I vote for destroying Azkaban, said Gryffindor. It\nneeds to be done anyway.",
      "Really, really stupid, said Internal Consistency\nChecker. Oh, screw this, I'm assuming control of our\nbody.",
      "The boy took a deep breath, and opened his mouth -",
      "By this point Harry Potter had entirely forgotten the existence\nof Professor McGonagall, who had been sitting there this whole time\nundergoing a number of interesting changes of facial expression\nwhich Harry had not been looking at because he was distracted. It\nwould have been overly harsh to say that Harry had forgotten her\nbecause he did not consider her a PC. It could be more kindly said\nthat Professor McGonagall was not visibly a solution to any of his\ncurrent problems, and therefore she was not part of the\nuniverse.",
      "So Harry, who at this point had a fair amount of adrenaline in\nhis bloodstream, startled and jumped quite visibly when Professor\nMcGonagall, her eyes now blazing with impossible hope and the tears\non her cheek half-dried, leapt to her feet and cried, \"With me,\nMr. Potter!\u202f\" and, without waiting for a reply, tore down the\nstairs that led to the bottom platform where waited a chair of dark\nmetal.",
      "It took a moment, but Harry ran after; though it took him longer\nto reach the bottom, after Professor McGonagall vaulted half the\nstairs with a strange catlike motion and landed with the\nastonished-looking Auror trio already pointing their wands at\nher.",
      "\"Miss Granger!\" cried Professor McGonagall. \"Can you speak\nyet?\"",
      "Much as with Professor McGonagall, there was a certain sense in\nwhich it could be said that Harry had forgotten about the existence\nof Hermione Granger, because Harry had been tilting his neck back\nto look upward rather than downward, and because he hadn't\nconsidered her a solution to any of his current problems. Though it\nwas hardly certain, in fact it wasn't at all probable, that Harry\nremembering to look at Hermione or think about what she must be\nfeeling, would have helped anything in the slightest.",
      "Harry reached the bottom of the stairs and saw Hermione Granger\nfull on -",
      "Without thinking, without being able to help himself, Harry shut\nhis eyes, but he'd seen.",
      "Her school robes around her neck, soaked all the way through\nwith tears.",
      "The way she'd been looking away from him.",
      "And the eye of memory and sympathy, which could not be shut,\nwhich could not look away, knew that Hermione had recounted the\nworst shame of her life in front of the nobility of magical Britain\nand Professor McGonagall and Dumbledore and Harry; and then been\nsentenced to Azkaban where she would be exposed to darkness and\ncold and all her worst memories until she went mad and died; and\nthen she'd heard that Harry was going to give away all his money\nand go into debt to save her, and maybe even sacrifice his life",
      "and with the Dementor standing only a few paces behind her",
      "she hadn't said anything...",
      "\"Y-yes,\" whispered the voice of Hermione Granger. \"I c-can\ntalk.\"",
      "Harry opened his eyes again and saw her face, now looking at\nhim. It didn't say anything like what he thought Hermione was\nfeeling, faces couldn't say anything that complicated, all facial\nmuscles could do was contort themselves into knots.",
      "\"H-H-Harry, I-I'm so, I'm so -\"",
      "\"Shut up,\" Harry suggested.",
      "\"s-s-sorry -\"",
      "\"If you'd never met me on the train you wouldn't be in any\ntrouble right now. So shut up,\" said Harry Potter.",
      "\"Both of you stop being silly,\" Professor McGonagall said in her\nfirm Scottish accent (it was strange how much that helped). \"Mr.\nPotter, hold out your wand so that Miss Granger's fingers can touch\nit. Miss Granger, repeat after me. Upon my life and magic -\"",
      "Harry did as he was bid, thrusting his wand forward to touch\nHermione's fingers; and then Hermione's faltering voice said, \"Upon\nmy life and magic -\"",
      "\"I swear service to the House of Potter -\" said Professor\nMcGonagall.",
      "And Hermione, without waiting for any further instructions,\nsaid, the words spilling out of her in a rush, \"I swear service to\nthe House of Potter, to obey its Master or Mistress, and stand at\ntheir right hand, and fight at their command, and follow where they\ngo, until the day I die.\"",
      "All those words had been blurted out in a desperate gasp before\nHarry could have thought or said anything, if he'd been mad enough\nto interrupt.",
      "\"Mr. Potter, repeat these words,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"I,\nHarry, heir and last scion of the Potters, accept your service,\nuntil the end of the world and its magic.\"",
      "Harry took a breath and said, \"I, Harry, heir and last scion of\nthe Potters, accept your service, until the end of the world and\nits magic.\"",
      "\"That's it,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Well done.\"",
      "Harry looked up, and saw that the entire Wizengamot, whose\nexistence he'd forgotten, was staring at them.",
      "And then Minerva McGonagall, who was Head of House\nGryffindor even if she didn't always act like it, looked up high\nabove at where Lucius Malfoy stood; and she said to him before the\nentire Wizengamot, \"I regret every point I ever gave you in\nTransfiguration, you vile little worm.\"",
      "Whatever Lucius was about to say in reply was silenced by a tap\nof the short rod in Dumbledore's hand. \"Ahem!\" said the old wizard\nfrom his podium of dark stone. \"This session has carried on quite\nconsiderably, and if it is not dismissed soon, some of us may miss\ntheir entire luncheon. The law of this matter is clear. You have\nalready voted on the terms of the bargain, and Lord Malfoy cannot\nlegally decline it. As we have far exceeded our allotted time, I\nnow, in accordance with the last decision of the survivors of the\neighty-eighth Wizengamot, adjourn this session.\"",
      "The old wizard tapped the rod of dark stone three times.",
      "\"You fools!\" shouted Lucius Malfoy. The white hair was shaking\nas though in a wind, the face beneath was pale with fury. \"Do you\nthink you'll get away with what you've done today? Do you think\nthat girl can try to murder my son and escape unscathed?\"",
      "The toad-like pink-makeup woman, whose name Harry could no\nlonger remember, was standing up from her seat. \"Why, of course\nnot,\" she said with a sickening smile. \"After all, the girl\nis still a murderess, and I think the Ministry shall be\nwatching her affairs quite closely - it hardly seems wise that she\nshould be allowed to wander the streets, after all -\"",
      "Harry was fed up at this point.",
      "Without waiting to listen, Harry turned on his heel and strode\nforward in long steps toward -",
      "The horror only he could truly see, the absence of color and\nspace, the wound in the world, above which floated a tattered\ncloak; most imperfectly guarded by a running moonlit squirrel and\nfluttering silver sparrow.",
      "His dark side had also noticed, when it was looking through the\nentire room for anything that could possibly be used as a weapon,\nthat the enemy had been foolish enough to bring a Dementor into\nHarry's presence. That was a powerful weapon indeed, and one that\nHarry might wield better than its supposed masters. There had been\na time in Azkaban when Harry had told twelve Dementors to turn and\ngo, and they had gone.",
      "The Dementors are Death, and the Patronus Charm works by\nthinking about happy thoughts instead of Death.",
      "If Harry's theory was correct, that one sentence would be all it\ntook to pop the Aurors' Patronus Charms like a soap bubble, and\nensure that nobody within reach of his voice could cast another\none.",
      "I am going to cancel the Patronus Charms and prevent any\nmore Patronuses from being cast. And then my Dementor, flying\nfaster than any broomstick, is going to Kiss everyone here who\nvoted to send a twelve-year-old girl to Azkaban.",
      "Say that, to set up the if-then expectation, and wait for people\nto understand and laugh. Then speak the fatal truth; and when the\nAurors' Patronuses winked out to prove the point, either people's\nanticipations of the mindless void, or Harry's threat of\nits destruction, would make the Dementor obey. Those who had sought\nto compromise with the darkness would be consumed by it.",
      "It was the other solution his dark side had devised.",
      "Ignoring the gasps rising from behind him, Harry crossed the\nradius of the Patronuses, strode to a single pace from Death. Its\nunhindered fear burst around him like a whirlpool, like stepping\nnext to the sucking drain of some huge bathtub emptying out its\nwater; but with the false Patronuses no longer obscuring the level\non which they interacted, Harry could reach the Dementor even as it\ncould reach him. Harry looked straight into the pulling vacuum and\n-",
      "the Earth among the stars",
      "all his triumph at saving Hermione",
      "someday the reality of which you are a shadow will cease to\nexist",
      "Harry took all the silver emotion that fueled his Patronus Charm\nand shoved it at the Dementor; and expected Death's shadow\nto flee from him -",
      "- and as Harry did that, he flung his hands up and shouted\n\"BOO!\"",
      "The void retreated sharply away from Harry until it came up\nagainst the dark stone behind.",
      "In the hall there was a deathly silence.",
      "Harry turned his back on the empty void, and looked up at where\nthe toad-woman stood. She was pale beneath the pink makeup, her\nmouth opening and closing like a fish.",
      "\"I make you this one offer,\" said the Boy-Who-Lived. \"I never\nlearn that you've been interfering with me or any of mine. And you\nnever find out why the unkillable soul-eating monster is scared of\nme. Now sit down and shut up.\"",
      "The toad-woman fell back down to her bench without a word.",
      "Harry looked further up.",
      "\"A riddle, Lord Malfoy!\" the Boy-Who-Lived shouted across the\nMost Ancient Hall. \"I know you weren't in Ravenclaw, but try to\nanswer this one anyway! What destroys Dark Lords, frightens\nDementors, and owes you sixty thousand Galleons?\"",
      "For an instant Lord Malfoy stood there with eyes slightly\nwidened; then his face fell back into calm scorn, and his voice\nspoke coolly in reply. \"Are you openly threatening me, Mr.\nPotter?\"",
      "\"I'm not threatening you,\" said the Boy-Who-Lived. \"I'm\nscaring you. There's a difference.\"",
      "\"Enough, Mr. Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"We shall be\nlate for afternoon Transfiguration as it is. And do come back here,\nyou're still terrifying that poor Dementor.\" She turned to the\nAurors. \"Mr. Kleiner, if you would!\"",
      "Harry strode back to them, as the Auror addressed moved forward\nand pressed a short rod of dark metal to the dark metal chair,\nmuttering an inaudible word of dismissal.",
      "The chains slithered back as smoothly as they had come forth;\nand Hermione pushed herself out of the chair as fast as she could,\nand half-ran and half-staggered forward a few steps.",
      "Harry held out his arms -",
      "- and Hermione half-jumped half-fell into Professor McGonagall's\narms, beginning to sob hysterically.",
      "Hmpfh, said a voice inside Harry. I kind of thought\nwe'd earned that one ourselves.",
      "Oh, shut up.",
      "Professor McGonagall was holding Hermione so firmly that you\nmight have thought it was a mother holding her daughter, or maybe\ngranddaughter. After a few moments Hermione's sobs slowed, and then\nstopped. Professor McGonagall suddenly shifted her stance and\ngrabbed onto her more tightly; the girl's hands were dangling\nlimply, now, and her eyes were closed -",
      "\"She'll be fine, Mr. Potter,\" Professor McGonagall said softly\nin Harry's direction, without looking at him. \"She just needs a few\nhours in one of Madam Pomfrey's beds.\"",
      "\"All right, then,\" Harry said. \"Let's get her to Madam\nPomfrey's.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore, as he descended to the bottom of the\ndark stone stairs. \"Let us all go home, indeed.\" His blue eyes were\nlocked on Harry, as hard as sapphires.",
      "The Lords and Ladies of the Wizengamot are departing their\nwooden benches, leaving as they came, looking rather nervous.",
      "The vast majority are thinking 'The Dementor was frightened of\nthe Boy-Who-Lived!'",
      "Some of the shrewder ones are already wondering how this will\naffect the delicate power balance of the Wizengamot - if a new\npiece has appeared upon the gameboard.",
      "Almost none are thinking anything along the lines of 'I wonder\nhow he did that.'",
      "This is the truth of the Wizengamot: Many are nobles, many are\nwealthy magnates of business, a few came by their status in other\nways. Some of them are stupid. Most are shrewd in the realms of\nbusiness and politics, but their shrewdness is circumscribed.\nAlmost none have walked the path of a powerful wizard. They have\nnot read through ancient books, scrutinized old scrolls, searching\nfor truths too powerful to walk openly and disguised in conundrums,\nhunting for true magic among a hundred fantastic fairy tales. When\nthey are not looking at a contract of debt, they abandon what\nshrewdness they possess and relax with some comfortable nonsense.\nThey believe in the Deathly Hallows, but they also believe that\nMerlin fought the dread Totoro and imprisoned the Ree. They know\n(because that too is part of the standard legend) that a powerful\nwizard must learn to distinguish the truth among a hundred\nplausible lies. But it has not occurred to them that they might do\nthe same.",
      "(Why not? Why, indeed, would wizards with enough status and\nwealth to turn their hands to almost any endeavor, choose to spend\ntheir lives fighting over lucrative monopolies on ink importation?\nThe Headmaster of Hogwarts would hardly see the question; of course\nmost people should not be powerful wizards, just as most people\nshould not be heroes. The Defense Professor could explain at great\nand cynical length why their ambitions are so trivial; to him, too,\nthere is no puzzle. Only Harry Potter, for all the books he has\nread, is unable to understand; to the Boy-Who-Lived the life\nchoices of the Lords and Ladies seem incomprehensible - not what a\ngood person would do, nor yet an evil person either. Now which of\nthe three is most wise?)",
      "For whatever reason, then, most of the Wizengamot has never\nwalked the path that leads to powerful wizardry; they do not seek\nout what is hidden. For them, there is no why. There is no\nexplanation. There is no causality. The Boy-Who-Lived, who was\nalready halfway into the magisterium of legend, has now been\npromoted all the way there; and it is a brute fact, simple and\nunexplained, that the Boy-Who-Lived frightens Dementors. Ten years\nearlier they were told that a one-year-old boy defeated the most\nterrible Dark Lord of their generation, perhaps the most evil Dark\nLord ever to live; and they just accepted that too.",
      "You are not meant to question that sort of thing (they know in\nsome unspoken way). If the most terrible Dark Lord in history,\nconfronts an innocent baby - why, how could he not be\nvanquished? The rhythm of the play demands it. You are supposed to\napplaud, not stand up from your seat in the audience and say 'Why?'\nIt is just the story's conceit, that in the end the Dark Lord is\nbrought down by a little child; and if you are going to question\nthat, you might as well not attend the play in the first place.",
      "It does not occur to them to second-guess the application of\nsuch reasoning to the events they have seen with their own eyes in\nthe Most Ancient Hall. Indeed, they are not consciously aware that\nthey are using story-reasoning on real life. As for scrutinizing\nthe Boy-Who-Lived with the same careful logic they would use on a\npolitical alliance or a business arrangement - what brain would\nassociate to that, when a part of the legendary\nmagisterium is at hand?",
      "But there are a very few, seated on those wooden benches, who do\nnot think like this.",
      "There are a certain few of the Wizengamot who have read through\nhalf-disintegrated scrolls and listened to tales of things that\nhappened to someone's brother's cousin, not for entertainment, but\nas part of a quest for power and truth. They have already marked\nthe Night of Godric's Hollow, as reported by Albus Dumbledore, as\nan anomalous and potentially important event. They have wondered\nwhy it happened, if it did happen; or if not, why Dumbledore is\nlying.",
      "And when an eleven-year-old boy rises up and says \"Lucius\nMalfoy\" in that cold adult voice, and goes on to speak words one\nsimply would not expect to hear from a first-year in Hogwarts, they\ndo not allow the fact to slip into the lawless blurs of legends and\nthe premises of plays.",
      "They mark it as a clue.",
      "They add it to the list.",
      "This list is beginning to look somewhat alarming.",
      "It doesn't particularly help when the boy yells \"BOO!\" at a\nDementor and the decaying corpse presses itself flat against the\nopposite wall and its horrible ear-hurting voice rasps, \"Make\nhim go away.\""

      "Phoenix travel was a sensation entirely unlike Apparition or\nportkeys. You caught on fire - you definitely felt yourself\ncatching on fire, even though there was no pain - and instead of\nburning to ashes, the fire burned all the way through you and you\nbecame fire, and then you went out in one place and blazed\nup in another. It didn't sicken the stomach like portkeys or\nApparition, but it was a rather unnerving experience nonetheless.\nIf the underlying truth of phoenix travel really was becoming a\nspecific instantiation of a more general Fire, then that seemed to\nhint you could potentially burn anywhere - even in the\ndistant past, or in another universe, or in two places at once. You\nmight go out in one place and blaze up in a hundred others, and the\nyou who arrived at Hogwarts would never know the difference. Though\nHarry had read what he could about phoenixes, trying to figure out\nhow to get one of his own, and there'd been no hint of anything\nremotely like that capability.",
      "Harry caught fire and went out and blazed up somewhere else; and\njust like that he, and the Headmaster, and the unconscious form of\nHermione Granger held in the Headmaster's arms, were occupying\nanother place; with Fawkes above them all. A calm, warm room of\nbright stone columns, skylit on all four sides, populated by white\nbeds in long rows, four of which had silencing veils drawn around\nthem, and the rest empty.",
      "In one corner of Harry's vision, a surprised-looking Madam\nPomfrey was turning toward them. Dumbledore seemed to pay the\nsenior healer no heed, as he carefully laid down Hermione on an\nunoccupied white bed.",
      "From a distant corner there was a flash of green, and from out\nof a fireplace strode Professor McGonagall, brushing herself off\nslightly from the Floo ashes.",
      "The old wizard turned from the bed and reached one of his arms\naround Harry again; and then the Boy-Who-Lived and his wizard\nvanished in another burst of fire.",
      "When Harry had fully lit up again he was standing in the\nHeadmaster's office, amid the noises of a dozen dozen inexplicable\ngidgets.",
      "The young boy took a step away from the old wizard and then\nturned on him, emerald and sapphire eyes meeting.",
      "The two of them did not speak for a time, looking at each other;\nas though all they had to speak could be said only by stares, and\nnot said in any other way.",
      "In time the boy enunciated words slowly and precisely.",
      "\"I cannot believe that a phoenix is still upon your\nshoulder.\"",
      "\"The phoenix chooses but once,\" said the old wizard. \"They might\nperhaps leave a master who chooses evil over good; they will not\nleave a master forced to choose between one good and another.\nPhoenixes are not arrogant. They know the limits of their own\nwisdom.\" Stern indeed, that ancient gaze. \"Unlike you, Harry.\"",
      "\"Choose between one good and another,\" Harry echoed flatly.\n\"Like Hermione Granger's life, versus a hundred thousand Galleons.\"\nThe rage and indignation Harry wanted to put into his voice wasn't\nquite there, for some reason, maybe because -",
      "\"You are hardly in a position to speak to me of that, Harry\nPotter.\" The Headmaster's voice was deceptively soft. \"Or what was\nthat look of reluctance that I saw upon your face, there in the\nMost Ancient Hall?\"",
      "The sense of inward hollowness grew worse. \"I was looking for\nother alternatives,\" Harry bit out. \"Some way to save her that\ndidn't lose the money.\"",
      "Wow, said Ravenclaw. You just told an outright lie.\nNot only that, I think you actually believed it for the\nseconds it took to say it. That's kinda scary.",
      "\"Is that what you were thinking, Harry?\" The blue eyes\nwere keen, and there was a terrifying moment when Harry wondered if\nthe world's most powerful wizard could see right past his\nOcclumency barriers.",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry said, \"I flinched away from the pain of\nlosing all the money in my vault. But I did it!\nThat's what counts! And you -\" The indignation\nthat had faltered out of Harry's voice returned. \"You\nactually put a price on Hermione Granger's life, and you\nput it below a hundred thousand Galleons!\"",
      "\"Oh?\" the old wizard said softly. \"And what price do you put on\nher life, then? A million Galleons?\"",
      "\"Are you familiar with the economic concept of 'replacement\nvalue'?\" The words were spilling from Harry's lips almost faster\nthan he could consider them. \"Hermione's replacement value is\ninfinite! There's nowhere I can go to buy another\none!\"",
      "Now you're just talking mathematical nonsense, said\nSlytherin. Ravenclaw, back me up here?",
      "\"Is Minerva's life also of infinite worth?\" the old wizard said\nharshly. \"Would you sacrifice Minerva to save Hermione?\"",
      "\"Yes and yes,\" Harry snapped. \"That's part of Professor\nMcGonagall's job and she knows it.\"",
      "\"Then Minerva's value is not infinite,\" said the old wizard,\n\"for all that she is loved. There can only be one king upon a\nchessboard, Harry Potter, only one piece that you will sacrifice\nany other piece to save. And Hermione Granger is not that piece.\nMake no mistake, Harry Potter, this day you may well have lost your\nwar.\"",
      "And if the old wizard's words hadn't hit quite so hard, and\nquite so close to home, Harry might not have said what he said\nthen.",
      "\"Lucius was right,\" Harry ground out. \"You never had a wife, you\nnever had a daughter, you've never had anything but war -\"",
      "The old wizard's left hand closed hard upon Harry's wrist, bony\nfingers digging into the still-developing muscle of Harry's arm,\nand for a moment Harry was paralyzed with the shock of it, he had\nforgotten what it meant that adults were stronger.",
      "Albus Dumbledore did not seem to notice. He only turned,\ndragging Harry with him, and moved forward in hard steps toward the\nwall of the room.",
      "\"Phoenix's price.\"",
      "Harry was pulled up along the black stairs.",
      "\"Phoenix's fate.\"",
      "The room of black pedestals, silver light falling on shattered\nwands.",
      "\"You think,\" yelled Harry, after his lips unlocked, \"that you\ncan win any argument, just by standing here?\"",
      "The old wizard ignored him, dragging Harry across the room. His\nright hand, no longer holding his wand, grabbed up a vial of silver\nfluid -",
      "Harry blinked in shock; the vial of silver fluid had been\nstanding next to a picture of Dumbledore, or so it had\nappeared to Harry in the brief moment before he was dragged\npast.",
      "Past the end of all the pedestals, at the farthest part of the\nroom, rose a great stone basin with runes carved into it that Harry\ndidn't recognize. The center was a shallow depression filled with\ntransparent liquid, and into this the old wizard dumped the\ncanister of silver fluid, which at once began to spread out, to\nswirl, to set the entire basin glowing eerie white.",
      "The old wizard's hand let go of Harry's arm and gestured to the\nglowing basin, commanding harshly, \"Look!\"",
      "As requested, Harry stared at the glowing water.",
      "\"Put your head into the Pensieve, Harry Potter.\" The old\nwizard's voice was stern.",
      "Harry had heard that word before, but he couldn't remember where\n. \"What - does this do -\"",
      "\"Memories,\" the old wizard said. \"You will see my memory. My\noath that it is safe. Now look into the Pensieve, Ravenclaw, if you\nstill care anything at all for your precious truth!\"",
      "That was a request that Harry could not deny, and he stepped\nforward and thrust his head into the glowing water.",
      "Harry was sitting behind the desk in the Headmaster's office\nof Hogwarts, and his wrinkled hands that clutched at his head were\nspotted with age and white hairs.",
      "\"He is all that I have!\" wept a voice, very strange was\nDumbledore's voice as Dumbledore himself remembered it, from the\ninside it seemed far less stern and wise. \"The last of my family!\nAll that I have left!\"",
      "No emotion had been allowed to pass through the Pensieve,\nonly the physical sensation of seeming to speak the words. Harry\nheard the utter desolation in Dumbledore's words, the sounds that\nseemed to come from Harry's own throat, but Harry did not feel it\nbeyond the hearing.",
      "\"You've got no choice,\" said a harsh voice.",
      "The eyes moved, the field of vision jumped to a man that\nHarry didn't recognize, in clothing tinged with Auror crimson but\nmade of solid leather with many pockets.",
      "His right eye was overlarge, with an electric-blue pupil\nthat constantly darted and moved.",
      "\"You cannot ask this of me, Alastor!\" Dumbledore's voice was\nwild. \"Not this! Anything but this!\"",
      "\"I'm not asking,\" growled the man. \"Voldie's the one who's\nasking, and you're going to tell him no.\"",
      "\"For money, Alastor?\" Dumbledore's voice was begging. \"Only\nfor money?\"",
      "\"You ransom Aberforth, you lose the war,\" the man said\nsharply. \"That simple. One hundred thousand Galleons is nearly all\nwe've got in the war-chest, and if you use it like this, it won't\nbe refilled. What'll you do, try to convince the Potters to empty\ntheir vault like the Longbottoms already did? Voldie's just going\nto kidnap someone else and make another demand. Alice, Minerva,\nanyone you care about, they'll all be targets if you pay off the\nDeath Eaters. That's not the lesson you should be trying to teach\nthem.\"",
      "\"If I do this I will have no one. No one.\" Dumbledore's\nvoice broke, the world tilted as the outlooking head fell down into\nthe ancient hands, and awful sounds came from not-Harry's throat as\nhe began to sob like a child.",
      "\"Shall I tell Voldie's messenger no?\" said Alastor's voice,\nnow strangely gentle. \"You don't have to do it yourself, old\nfriend.\"",
      "\"No - I will say it myself - I must -\"",
      "The memory ended with a shock and Harry ripped his head out of\nthe glowing water, gasping as though he'd been deprived of air.",
      "The transition between scenes, between decade-old reality and\npresent moment, was another jolt to Harry's mind; in some fashion\nhis immersion in the past had unanchored him. The broken old man\nsobbing in his office had been another person in another era, Harry\nhad understood that much; someone softer -",
      "Before it had all vanished like dissipating smoke, returning the\nnow, the present day.",
      "Terrible and stern stood the ancient wizard, like he was carven\nfrom stone; beard woven of thread like iron, half-moon glasses like\nmirrors, and the pupils behind as sharp and unyielding as black\ndiamond.",
      "\"Do you also wish to see my brother as he died under the\nCruciatus?\" said Albus Dumbledore. \"Voldemort sent me that memory\nas well!\"",
      "\"And that - \" Harry was having trouble producing a voice, for\nthe growing sickness in his chest. \"That was when -\" The\nwords seemed to burn in his throat, as the awful knowledge dawned\non him, the horrible understanding. \"That was when you burned\nNarcissa Malfoy alive in her own bedroom.\"",
      "Albus Dumbledore's gaze was cold as he answered. \"To that\nquestion only a fool would say yea or nay. What matters is that the\nDeath Eaters believe I killed her, and that belief kept safe the\nfamilies of all who served the Order of the Phoenix - until this\nday. Now do you understand what you have done? What you have done\nto your friends, Harry Potter, and to any that stand with\nyou?\" The old wizard seemed to grow still taller and more terrible,\nas his voice rose louder. \"You have made them all targets, and\ntargets they will remain! Until you prove, the only way it can be\nproven, that you are no longer willing to pay such prices!\"",
      "\"And is it true?\" Harry said. There was a buzzing sensation\nfilling him, his body growing more distant. \"What Draco said, that\nNarcissa Malfoy never got her hands dirty, that she was only\nLucius's wife? She was an enabler, I get that, but I can't back\nthat deserving being burned alive.\"",
      "\"Nothing less would have convinced them that I was done with\nhesitation.\" The old wizard's voice brooked no question and no\nrefusal. \"Always I was too reluctant to do as I must, always it was\nothers who paid the cost of my mercy. So Alastor told me from the\nbeginning, but I did not listen to him. You, I expect, shall prove\nbetter at such decisions than I.\"",
      "\"I'm surprised,\" Harry said, amazed that his voice was almost\nsteady. \"I would have expected the Death Eaters to go after another\nLight family and start a cycle of escalating retaliation, if you\ndidn't get them all with your first strike.\"",
      "\"If my opponent had been Lucius, perhaps.\" Dumbledore's eyes\nwere like stones. \"I am told that Voldemort laughed at the news,\nand proclaimed to his Death Eaters that I had finally grown, and\nwas at last a worthy opponent. Perhaps he was right. After the day\nI condemned my brother to his death, I began to weigh those who\nfollowed me, balancing them one against another, asking who I would\nrisk, and who I would sacrifice, to what end. It was strange how\nmany fewer pieces I lost, once I knew what they were worth.\"",
      "Harry's jaw seemed locked, like it took a massive effort to make\nhis lips move. \"But then it's not like Lucius was deliberately\ntaking Hermione for ransom,\" Harry's voice said thinly. \"From\nLucius's perspective, someone else broke the truce first. So with\nthat in mind, how many Galleons was Hermione worth,\nexactly? Leaving aside the Danegeld thing, if it was just some\nordinary threat to her life, how much should I have paid to save\nher? Ten thousand Galleons? Five thousand?\"",
      "The old wizard did not answer.",
      "\"It's a funny thing,\" Harry said, his voice wavering like\nsomething seen through water. \"Do you know, the day I went in front\nof the Dementor, what my worst memory was? It was my parents dying.\nI heard their voices and everything.\"",
      "The old wizard's eyes widened behind the half-moon glasses.",
      "\"And here's the thing,\" Harry said, \"here's the thing I've been\nthinking about over and over. The Dark Lord gave Lily Potter the\nchance to walk away. He said that she could flee. He told\nher that dying in front of the crib wouldn't save her baby. 'Step\naside, foolish woman, if you have any sense in you at all -'\" An\nawful chill came over Harry as he spoke those words from his own\nlips, but he shook it off and continued. \"And afterward I kept\nthinking, I couldn't seem to stop myself from thinking, wasn't the\nDark Lord right? If only Mother had stepped away. She\ntried to curse the Dark Lord but it was suicide, she had to have\nknown that it was suicide. Her choice wasn't between her\nlife and mine, her choice was for herself to live or for both of us\nto die! If she'd only done the logical thing and walked away, I\nmean, I love Mum too, but Lily Potter would be alive right now and\nshe would be my mother!\" Tears were blurring Harry's eyes. \"Only\nnow I understand, I know what Mother must have felt. She\ncouldn't step aside from the crib. She couldn't! Love\ndoesn't walk away!\"",
      "It was like the old wizard had been struck, struck by a chisel\nthat shattered him straight down the middle.",
      "\"What have I said?\" the old wizard whispered. \"What have I said\nto you?\"",
      "\"I don't know!\" shouted Harry. \"I wasn't listening either!\"",
      "\"I - I'm sorry, Harry - I -\" The old wizard pressed his hands to\nhis face, and Harry saw that Albus Dumbledore was weeping. \"I\nshould not have said, such things to you - I should not, have\nresented, your innocence -\"",
      "Harry stared at the wizard for another second, and then Harry\nturned and marched out of the black room, down the stairs, through\nthe office -",
      "\"I really don't know why you're still on his shoulder,\" Harry\nsaid to Fawkes.",
      "- out the oaken door and into the endlessly turning spiral.",
      "Harry had arrived in the Transfiguration classroom before anyone\nelse, before even Professor McGonagall. There was Charms class\nearlier, for his year, but that he hadn't even bothered trying to\nattend. Whether Professor McGonagall would make today's class he\ndidn't know. There was something ominous about all the empty desks\nbeside him, the absence at the board. As if he stood alone in\nHogwarts, with all his friends departed.",
      "According to the class schedule, today's lesson was on sustained\nTransfigurations, all the rules of which Harry had learned by heart\nback when he was Transfiguring a huge rock into the small diamond\nthat shone on his pinky finger. It would be a theoretical subject,\nrather than practical, for the rest of the class; which was a pity,\nbecause he could have used a dose of Transfiguration's trance.",
      "Harry noted distantly that his hand was trembling, to the point\nwhere he had trouble undoing the pouch's drawstring as he drew\nforth the Transfiguration textbook.",
      "You were monstrously unfair to Dumbledore, said the\nvoice Harry had been calling Slytherin, only now it also seemed to\nbe the Voice of Economic Sensibility and maybe also Conscience.",
      "Harry's eyes dropped down to his textbook, but the section was\nso familiar it might as well have been a blank parchment.",
      "Dumbledore fought a war against a Dark Lord who deliberately\nset out to break him in the cruelest possible way. He had to choose\nbetween losing his war and his brother. Albus Dumbledore knows, he\nlearned in the worst possible way, that there are limits to the\nvalue of one life; and it almost broke his sanity to admit it. But\nyou, Harry Potter - you already knew better.",
      "\"Shut up,\" the boy whispered to the empty Transfiguration\nclassroom, though there was nobody there to hear it.",
      "You'd already read about Philip Tetlock's experiments on\npeople asked to trade off a sacred value against a secular one,\nlike a hospital administrator who has to choose between spending a\nmillion dollars on a liver to save a five-year-old, and spending\nthe million dollars to buy other hospital equipment or pay\nphysician salaries. And the subjects in the experiment became\nindignant and wanted to punish the hospital administrator for even\nthinking about the choice. Do you remember reading about that,\nHarry Potter? Do you remember thinking how very stupid that was,\nsince if hospital equipment and doctor salaries didn't also save\nlives, there would be no point in having hospitals or doctors?\nShould the hospital administrator have paid a billion pounds for\nthat liver, even if it meant the hospital going bankrupt the next\nday?",
      "\"Shut up!\" the boy whispered.",
      "Every time you spend money in order to save a life with some\nprobability, you establish a lower bound on the monetary value of a\nlife. Every time you refuse to spend money to save a life with some\nprobability, you establish an upper bound on the monetary value of\nlife. If your upper bounds and lower bounds are inconsistent, it\nmeans you could move money from one place to another, and save more\nlives at the same cost. So if you want to use a bounded amount of\nmoney to save as many lives as possible, your choices must be\nconsistent with some monetary value assigned to a human\nlife; if not then you could reshuffle the same money and do better.\nHow very sad, how very hollow the indignation, of those who refuse\nto say that money and life can ever be compared, when all they're\ndoing is forbidding the strategy that saves the most people, for\nthe sake of pretentious moral grandstanding...",
      "You knew that, and you still said what you did to\nDumbledore.",
      "You deliberately tried to hurt Dumbledore's\nfeelings.",
      "He's never tried to hurt you, Harry Potter, not\nonce.",
      "Harry's head dropped into his hands.",
      "Why had Harry said what he'd said, to a sad old ancient wizard\nwho'd fought hard and endured more than anyone should ever have to\nendure? Even if the old wizard was wrong, did he deserve to be hurt\nfor it, after all that had happened to him? Why was there a part of\nhim that seemed to get angry at the old wizard beyond reason,\nlashing out at him harder than Harry had ever hit anyone, without\nthought of moderation once the rage had been raised, only to quiet\nas soon as Harry left his presence?",
      "Is it because you know Dumbledore won't fight back? That no\nmatter what you say to him, however unfair, he'll never use his own\npower against you, he'll never treat you the way you treat him? Is\nthis the way you treat people when you know they won't hit back?\nJames Potter's bullying genes, manifesting at last?",
      "Harry closed his eyes.",
      "Like the Sorting Hat speaking inside his head -",
      "What is the real reason for your anger?",
      "What do you fear?",
      "A whirlwind of images seemed to flash through Harry's mind,\nthen, the past Dumbledore weeping into his hands; the present form\nof the old wizard, standing tall and terrible; a vision of Hermione\nscreaming in her chains, in the metal chair, as Harry abandoned her\nto the Dementors; and an imagination of a woman with long white\nhair (had she looked like her husband?) falling amid the flames of\nher bedroom, as a wand was held upon her and orange light reflected\nfrom half-moon glasses.",
      "Albus Dumbledore had seemed to think that Harry would be better\nat that sort of thing than him.",
      "And Harry knew that he probably would be. He knew the math,\nafter all.",
      "But it was understood, somehow it was understood, that\nutilitarian ethicists didn't actually rob banks so they\ncould give the money to the poor. The end result of throwing away\nall ethical constraint wouldn't actually be sunshine and\nroses and happiness for all. The prescription of consequentialism\nwas to take the action that led to the best net consequences, not\nactions that had one positive consequence and wrecked everything\nelse along the way. Expected utility maximizers were allowed to\ntake common sense into account, when they were calculating their\nexpectations.",
      "Somehow Harry had understood that, even before anyone else had\nwarned him he'd understood. Before he'd read about Vladimir Lenin\nor the history of the French Revolution, he'd known. It might have\nbeen his earliest science fiction books warning him about people\nwith good intentions, or maybe Harry had just seen the logic for\nhimself. Somehow he'd known from the very beginning, that if he\nstepped outside his ethics whenever there was a reason,\nthe end result wouldn't be good.",
      "A final image came to him, then: Lily Potter standing in front\nof her baby's crib and measuring the intervals between outcomes:\nthe final outcome if she stayed and tried to curse her enemy (dead\nLily, dead Harry), the final outcome if she walked away (live Lily,\ndead Harry), weighing the expected utilities, and making the only\nsensible choice.",
      "She would've been Harry's mother if she had.",
      "\"But human beings can't live like that,\" the boy's lips\nwhispered to the empty classroom. \"Human beings can't live like\nthat.\""

      "\"Today, children,\" began the calm professional voice of the\nTransfiguration Professor, just as though nothing out of the\nordinary had happened that week, \"we shall learn how much effort it\ntakes to sustain a Transfiguration, and why, at your age, you\nshould not even try. The original Form is not gone, only\nsuppressed; and to maintain that suppression -\"",
      "\"Excuse me,\" said Padma Patil. She knew her voice was shaking,\nshe knew that she was trembling visibly, but she had to ask.\n\"Excuse me, Professor, what happened with Miss Granger?\"",
      "The Transfiguration Professor paused at the board, and turned to\nlook at Padma. The Professor should have looked stern, having been\ninterrupted without a hand being raised, but instead her face was\nkindly. \"You don't already know, Miss Patil? I expected that rumor\nwould have spread.\"",
      "\"There's too many rumors,\" said Padma. \"I don't know what's\ntrue.\"",

      "\"Oh, dear Merlin,\" said Professor McGonagall, her expression\ngrowing sharp, but then she visibly calmed herself. \"The affair was\nutterly ridiculous and I shan't go into detail. Let it stand that\nMiss Granger is resting with Madam Pomfrey for now, and coming back\nto classes tomorrow. And if I catch anyone bothering her, I shall\nturn them into glass vases and drop them.\"",

      "When Hermione Granger woke, she found herself lying in a soft,\ncomfortable bed of the Hogwarts infirmary, with a square of setting\nsunlight falling on her midriff, warm through the thin blanket.\nMemory said that there would be a screen-sheet above her, either\ndrawn around her bed or open, and that the rest of Madam Pomfrey's\ndomain would lie beyond: the other beds, occupied or unoccupied,\nand bright windows set in the curvily-carven stone of Hogwarts.",
      "When Hermione opened her eyes, the first thing she saw was the\nface of Professor McGonagall, sitting on the left side of her bed.\nProfessor Flitwick wasn't there, but that was understandable, he'd\nstayed by her side all morning in the detention cell, his silver\nraven standing extra guard against the Dementor and his stern\nlittle face always turned outward toward the Aurors. The Head of\nRavenclaw had surely spent way too much time on her, and probably\nhad to get back to teaching his classes, instead of keeping watch\non a convicted attempted-murderess.",
      "She felt horribly, horribly sick and she didn't think it was\nbecause of any potions. Hermione would've started crying again,\nonly her throat hurt, her eyes still burned, and her mind just felt\ntired. She couldn't have borne to weep again, couldn't find the\nstrength for tears.",
      "\"Where are my parents?\" Hermione whispered to the Head of House\nGryffindor. Somehow it seemed like the worst thing in the world to\nface them, even worse than everything else; and yet she still\nwanted to see them.",
      "The gentle look on Professor McGonagall's face Transfigured into\nsomething sadder. \"I'm sorry, Miss Granger. Though it was not\nalways so, we have found in recent years that it is wiser not to\ntell the parents of Muggleborns about any danger their child has\nfaced. I should advise you also to remain silent, if you wish to\nstay at Hogwarts without trouble from them.\"",
      "\"I'm not being expelled?\" the girl whispered. \"For what I\ndid?\"",
      "\"No,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Miss Granger... surely you\nheard... I hope you heard Mr. Potter, when he said that you were\ninnocent?\"",
      "\"He was just saying that,\" she said dully. \"To get me free, I\nmean.\"",
      "The older witch shook her head firmly. \"No, Miss Granger. Mr.\nPotter believes you were Memory-Charmed, that the whole duel never\nhappened. The Headmaster suspects even Darker magics may have been\ninvolved - that your own hand might have cast the spell, but not\nyour own will. Even Professor Snape finds the affair completely\nunbelievable, though he may not be able to say so publicly. He was\nwondering if Muggle drugs might have been used on you.\"",
      "Hermione's eyes went on staring distantly at the Transfiguration\nProfessor; she knew that she'd just been told something\nsignificant, but she couldn't find the energy to propagate any\nchanges through her mind.",
      "\"Surely you don't believe it?\" said Professor\nMcGonagall. \"Miss Granger, you cannot believe of yourself that you\nwould turn to murder!\"",
      "\"But I -\" Her excellent memory helpfully replayed it for the\nthousandth time, Draco Malfoy telling her with a sneer that she'd\nnever beat him when he wasn't tired, and then proceeding to prove\njust that, dancing like a duelist between the warded trophies while\nshe frantically scrambled, and dealing the ending blow with a hex\nthat sent her crashing against the wall and drew blood from her\ncheek - and then - then she'd -",
      "\"But you remember doing it,\" said the older witch, who was\nwatching over her with kindly understanding. \"Miss Granger, there\nis no need for a twelve-year-old girl to bear such dreadful\nmemories. Say the word and I shall be happy to lock them away for\nyou.\"",
      "It was like a glass of warm water thrown into her face.\n\"What?\"",
      "Professor McGonagall took out her wand, a gesture so practiced\nand quick that it seemed like pointing a finger. \"I can't offer to\nrid you of the memories entirely, Miss Granger,\" the\nTransfiguration Professor said with her customary precision. \"There\nmay be important facts buried there. But there is a form of the\nMemory Charm which is reversible, and I shall be happy to cast that\non you.\"",
      "Hermione stared at the wand, feeling the stirrings of hope for\nthe first time in almost two days.",
      "Make it didn't happen... she'd wished that over and\nover again, for the hands of time to turn back and erase the\nhorrible choice that could never, ever be undone. And if erasing\nthe memory wasn't that, it was still a kind of release...",
      "She looked back at Professor McGonagall's kindly face.",
      "\"You really don't think I did it?\" Hermione said, her\nvoice trembling.",

      "\"Mr. Potter is of the opinion that your memories are entire\nfabrications. I can rather see his point.\"",
      "Then Hermione's clutching fingers let go of the sheet, and she\nslumped back into the bed, from which she'd partially risen.",
      "No.",
      "She hadn't said anything.",
      "She'd woken up and remembered what had happened last night, and\nit had been like - like - she couldn't find words even in her own\nthoughts for what it had been like. But she'd known that Draco\nMalfoy was already dead, and she hadn't said anything, hadn't gone\nto Professor Flitwick and confessed. She'd just dressed herself and\ngone down to breakfast and tried to act normal so that\nnobody would ever know, and she'd known it was wrong and Wrong and\nhorribly horribly WRONG but she'd been so, so scared -",
      "Even if Harry Potter was right, even if the duel with Draco\nMalfoy was a lie, she'd made that choice all by herself.\nShe didn't deserve to forget that, or be forgiven for it.",
      "And if she had done the right thing, gone straight to\nProfessor Flitwick, maybe that would've - helped, somehow, maybe\neveryone would've seen then that she regretted it, and Harry\nwouldn't have had to give away all his money to save her -",
      "Hermione shut her eyes, squeezed them shut really tight, she\ncouldn't bear to start crying again. \"I'm a horrible person,\" she\nsaid in a wavering voice. \"I'm awful, I'm not heroic at all -\"",
      "Professor McGonagall's voice was very sharp, like Hermione had\njust made some dreadful mistake on her Transfiguration homework.\n\"Stop being foolish, Miss Granger! Horrible is whoever did\nthis to you. And as for being heroic - well, Miss Granger, you have\nalready heard my opinion about young girls trying to involve\nthemselves in such things before they are even fourteen, so I shall\nnot lecture you on it again. I shall say only that you have just\nhad an absolutely dreadful experience, which you survived as well\nas any witch in your year possibly could. Today you are allowed to\ncry as much as you like. Tomorrow you are going back to class.\"",
      "That was when Hermione knew that Professor McGonagall couldn't\nhelp her. She needed someone to scold her, she couldn't be absolved\nif she couldn't be blamed, and Professor McGonagall would never do\nthat for her, would never ask so much of a little Ravenclaw\ngirl.",
      "It was something Harry Potter wouldn't help her with either.",
      "Hermione turned over in the infirmary bed, huddling into\nherself, away from Professor McGonagall. \"Please,\" she whispered.\n\"I want to talk - to the Headmaster -\"",
      "\"Hermione.\"",
      "When Hermione Granger opened her eyes a second time, she saw the\ncare-lined face of Albus Dumbledore leaning over her bedside,\nlooking almost as though he'd been crying, though that was\nimpossible; and Hermione felt another stabbing pang of guilt for\nhaving bothered him so.",
      "\"Minerva said you wished to speak with me,\" the old wizard\nsaid.",
      "\"I -\" Suddenly Hermione didn't know at all what to say. Her\nthroat locked up, and all she could do was stammer, \"I - I'm -\"",
      "Somehow her tone must have communicated the other word, the one\nshe couldn't even say anymore.",
      "\"Sorry?\u202f\" said Dumbledore. \"Why, for what should you be\nsorry?\"",
      "She had to force the words out of her throat. \"You were telling\nHarry - that he shouldn't pay - so I shouldn't - have done\nwhat Professor McGonagall said, I shouldn't have touched his wand\n-\"",
      "\"My dear,\" said Dumbledore, \"had you not pledged yourself to the\nHouse of Potter, Harry would have attacked Azkaban singlehandedly,\nand quite possibly won. That boy may choose his words carefully,\nbut I have never yet known him to lie; and in the Boy-Who-Lived\nthere is power that the Dark Lord never knew. He would indeed have\ntried to break Azkaban, even at cost of his life.\" The old wizard's\nvoice grew gentler, and kinder. \"No, Hermione, you have nothing at\nall for which to blame yourself.\"",
      "\"I could have made him not do it.\"",
      "In Dumbledore's eyes a small twinkle appeared before it was lost\nto weariness. \"Really, Miss Granger? Perhaps you should be\nHeadmistress in my place, for I myself have no such power over\nstubborn children.\"",
      "\"Harry promised -\" Her voice stopped. The awful truth was very\nhard to speak. \"Harry Potter promised me - that he would never help\nme - if I told him not to.\"",
      "There was a pause. The distant noises of the infirmary that had\naccompanied Professor McGonagall had ceased, Hermione realized,\nwhen Dumbledore had awoken her. From where she lay in bed she could\nsee only the ceiling, and the top of one wall's windows, but\nnothing in her range of vision moved, and if there were sounds, she\ncould not hear them.",
      "\"Ah,\" said Dumbledore. The old wizard sighed heavily. \"I suppose\nit is possible that the boy would have kept his\npromise.\"",
      "\"I should - I should've -\"",
      "\"Gone to Azkaban of your own will?\" Dumbledore said. \"Miss\nGranger, that is more than I would ever ask anyone to take upon\nthemselves.\"",
      "\"But -\" Hermione swallowed. She couldn't help but notice the\nloophole, anyone who wanted to get through the portrait-door to the\nRavenclaw dorm quickly learned to pay attention to exact wordings.\n\"But it's not more than you'd take on yourself.\"",
      "\"Hermione -\" the old wizard began.",
      "\"Why?\" said Hermione's voice, it seemed to be running on without\nher mind, now. \"Why couldn't I be braver? I was going to run in\nfront of the Dementor - for Harry - before, I mean, in January - so\nwhy - why - why couldn't I -\" Why had the thought of being sent to\nAzkaban just completely unglued her, why had she forgotten\neverything about being Good -",
      "\"My dear girl,\" Dumbledore said. The blue eyes behind the\nhalf-moon glasses showed a complete understanding of her guilt. \"I\nwould have done no better myself, in my first year in Hogwarts. As\nyou would be kind to others, be kinder to yourself as well.\"",
      "\"So I did do the wrong thing.\" Somehow she needed to\nsay that, to be told that, even though she already knew.",
      "There was a pause.",
      "\"Listen, young Ravenclaw,\" the old wizard said, \"hear me well,\nfor I shall speak to you a truth. Most ill-doers do not think of\nthemselves as evil; indeed, most conceive themselves the heroes of\nthe stories they tell. I once thought that the greatest evil in\nthis world was done in the name of the greater good. I was wrong.\nTerribly wrong. There is evil in this world which knows itself for\nevil, and hates the good with all its strength. All fair things\ndoes it desire to destroy.\"",
      "Hermione shivered in her bed, somehow it seemed very real, when\nDumbledore said it.",
      "The old wizard continued speaking. \"You are one of the fair\nthings of this world, Hermione Granger, and so that evil hates you\nas well. If you had stayed firm through even this trial, it would\nhave struck you harder and yet harder, until you shattered. Do not\nthink that heroes cannot be broken! We are only more difficult to\nbreak, Hermione.\" The old wizard's eyes had grown sterner than she\nhad ever seen. \"When you have been exhausted for many hours, when\npain and death is not a passing fear but a certainty, then it is\nharder to be a hero. If I must speak the truth - then today, yes, I\nwould not waver in the face of Azkaban. But when I was a first-year\nin Hogwarts - I would have fled from the Dementor that you\nconfronted, for my father had died in Azkaban, and I feared them.\nKnow this! The evil that struck at you could have broken anyone,\neven myself. Only Harry Potter has it within him to face that\nhorror, when he has come fully into his power.\"",
      "Hermione's neck couldn't stare at the old wizard any longer; she\nlet her head fall back, back to the pillow, where she stared up at\nthe ceiling, absorbing what she could.",
      "\"Why?\" Her voice trembled again. \"Why would anyone be that evil?\nI don't understand.\"",
      "\"I, too, have wondered,\" said Dumbledore's voice, a deep sadness\nin it. \"For thrice ten years I wondered, and I still do not\nunderstand. You and I will never understand, Hermione Granger. But\nat least I know now what true evil would say for itself, if we\ncould speak to it and ask why it was evil. It would say, Why\nnot?\u202f\"",
      "A brief flare of indignation inside her. \"There's got to be a\nmillion reasons why not!\"",
      "\"Indeed,\" said Dumbledore's voice. \"A million reasons and more.\nWe will always know those reasons, you and I. If you insist on\nputting it that way - then yes, Hermione, this day's trial broke\nyou. But what happens after you break - that, too, is part\nof being a hero. Which you are, Hermione Granger, and will always\nbe.\"",
      "She raised her head again, staring at him.",
      "The old wizard got up from beside her bed. His silver beard\ndipped down, as Dumbledore bowed to her gravely, and left.",
      "She went on looking at where the old wizard had gone.",
      "It should have meant something to her, should have touched her.\nShould have made her felt better inside, that Dumbledore, who had\nseemed so reluctant before, had now acknowledged her as a hero.",
      "She felt nothing.",
      "Hermione let her head fall back to the bed, as Madam Pomfrey\ncame and made her drink something that seared her lips like the\nafterburn of spicy food, and smelled even hotter, and didn't taste\nlike anything at all. It meant nothing to her. She went on staring\nup at the distant stone tiles of the ceiling.",
      "Minerva was waiting, doing her best not to hover, beside the\ndouble doors to the Hogwarts infirmary, she'd always thought of\nthose doors as \"the ominous gates\" as a child in Hogwarts, and\ncouldn't help but remember that now. Too much bad news had been\nspoken here -",
      "Albus stepped out. The old wizard did not pause on the way out\nof the infirmary, only kept walking toward Professor Flitwick's\noffice; and Minerva followed him.",
      "Professor McGonagall cleared her throat. \"Is it done,\nAlbus?\"",
      "The old wizard nodded in affirmation. \"If any hostile magic is\ncast on her, or any spirit touches her, I shall know, and\ncome.\"",
      "\"I spoke to Mr. Potter after Transfiguration class,\" said\nProfessor McGonagall. \"He was of the opinion that Miss Granger\nshould go to Beauxbatons, rather than Hogwarts, from now on.\"",
      "The old wizard shook his head. \"No. If Voldemort truly desires\nto strike at Miss Granger - he is tenacious beyond measure. His\nservants are returning to him, he could not have retrieved\nBellatrix alone. Azkaban itself is not safe from his malice, and as\nfor Beauxbatons - no, Minerva. I do not think Voldemort can essay\nsuch possessions often, or against stronger targets, or this year\nwould have gone quite differently. And Harry Potter is here, whom\nVoldemort must fear whether he admits it or no. Now that I have\nwarded her, Miss Granger will be safer within Hogwarts than\nwithout.\"",
      "\"Mr. Potter seemed to doubt that,\" Minerva said. She couldn't\nquite keep the edge from her voice; there was a part of her that\nagreed rather strongly. \"He seemed to feel that common sense said\nMiss Granger should continue her education anywhere but\nHogwarts.\"",
      "The old wizard sighed. \"I fear the boy has spent too much time\namong the Muggles. Always they reach for safety; always they\nimagine that safety can be reached. If Miss Granger is not safe\nwithin the center of our fortress, she shall be no safer for\nleaving it.\"",
      "\"Not everyone seems to think so,\" said Professor McGonagall. It\nhad been almost the first letter she'd seen when she'd taken a\nquick look at her desk; an envelope of the finest sheepskin, sealed\nin greenish-silver wax, pressed into the image of a snake that rose\nand hissed at her. \"I have received Lord Malfoy's owl withdrawing\nhis son from Hogwarts.\"",
      "The old wizard nodded, but did not break stride. \"Does Harry\nknow?\"",
      "\"Yes.\" Her voice faltered, for a moment, remembering Harry's\nexpression. \"After class, Mr. Potter complimented Lord Malfoy's\nexcellent good sense, and said that he would be writing Madam\nLongbottom advising her to do the same with her grandson, in case\nhe was the next target. In the event that Mr. Longbottom's guardian\nwas so negligent as to keep him in Hogwarts, Mr. Potter wanted him\nto have a Time-Turner, an invisibility cloak, a broomstick, and a\npouch in which to carry them; also a toe-ring with an emergency\nportkey to a safe location, in case someone kidnaps Mr. Longbottom\nand takes him outside Hogwarts's wards. I told Mr. Potter that I\ndid not think the Ministry would consent to such use of our\nTime-Turners, and he said that we should not ask. I expect he will\nwant Miss Granger to receive the same, if she stays. And for\nhimself Mr. Potter wants a three-person broomstick to carry in his\npouch.\" She wasn't awed by the list of precautions. Impressed with\nthe cleverness, but not awed; she was a Transfiguration Mistress,\nafter all. But it still sent shivers of disquiet through her, that\nHarry Potter now thought Hogwarts as dangerous as spell\nresearch.",
      "\"The Department of Mysteries is not lightly defied,\" said Albus.\n\"But for the rest -\" The old wizard seemed to slump in on himself\nslightly. \"We may as well give the boy what he wishes. And I will\nward Neville also, and write Augusta to say that he should stay\nhere over holiday.\"",
      "\"And finally,\" she said, \"Mr. Potter says - this is a direct\nquote, Albus - whatever kind of Dark Wizard attractant the\nHeadmaster is keeping here, he needs to get it out of this school,\nnow.\" She couldn't stop the edge in her own voice, that\ntime.",
      "\"I asked as much of Flamel,\" Albus said, the pain clear in his\nvoice. \"But Master Flamel has said - that even he can no\nlonger keep safe the Stone - that he believes Voldemort has means\nof finding it wherever it is hidden - and that he does not consent\nfor it to be guarded anywhere but Hogwarts. Minerva, I am sorry,\nbut it must be done - must!\u202f\"",
      "\"Very well,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"But for myself, I think\nthat Mr. Potter is right on every single count.\"",
      "The old wizard glanced at her, and his voice caught as he said,\n\"Minerva, you have known me long, and as well as any soul still\nliving - tell me, have I lost myself to darkness already?\"",
      "\"What?\" said Professor McGonagall in genuine surprise. Then,\n\"Oh, Albus, no!\"",
      "The old wizard's lips pressed together tightly before he spoke.\n\"For the greater good. I have sacrificed so many, for the greater\ngood. Today I almost condemned Hermione Granger to Azkaban for the\ngreater good. And I find myself - today, I found myself - beginning\nto resent the innocence that is no longer mine -\" The old wizard's\nvoice halted. \"Evil done in the name of good. Evil done in the name\nof evil. Which is worse?\"",
      "\"You are being silly, Albus.\"",
      "The old wizard glanced at her again, before turning his eyes\nback to their way. \"Tell me, Minerva - did you pause to weigh the\nconsequences, before you told Miss Granger how to bind herself to\nthe Potter family?\"",
      "She took an involuntary breath as she understood what she had\ndone -",
      "\"So you did not.\" Albus's eyes were saddened. \"No, Minerva, you\nmust not apologize. It is well. For what you have seen of me this\nday - if your first loyalty is now to Harry Potter, and not to me,\nthen that is right and proper.\" She opened her lips to protest, but\nAlbus went on before she could say a word. \"Indeed - indeed - that\nwill be necessary and more than necessary, if the Dark Lord that\nHarry must defeat to come into his power is not Voldemort after all\n-\"",
      "\"Not this again!\" Minerva said. \"Albus, it was\nYou-Know-Who, not you, who marked Harry as his equal. There is no\npossible way that the prophecy could be talking about\nyou!\"",
      "The old wizard nodded, but his eyes still seemed distant, fixed\nonly on the road ahead.",
      "The holding cell, well to the center of Magical Law Enforcement,\nwas luxuriously appointed; more a remark on what adult wizards took\nfor granted, than any special feeling toward prisoners. There was a\nself-reclining, self-rocking chair with plush, richly textured,\nself-warming cushions. There was a bookcase containing random books\nrescued from a bargain bin, and a full shelf of ancient magazines,\nincluding one from 1883. As for toiletries, well, it wasn't exactly\nluxurious, but there was a spell on the room which put all that\nbusiness on hold; you weren't to go anywhere that the watching\nAuror couldn't see you. But aside from that, it was quite a\npleasant little cell. The Defense Professor of Hogwarts was being\ndetained, not arrested, not even intimidated. There was no evidence\nto indict him... except that a terrible and unusual crime had been\ncommitted at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and\ngoing by previous occasions the odds were five to one that the\ncurrent Defense Professor was tangled up in it somehow. To\nthis must be added the fact that nobody in the D.M.L.E. even knew\nwho the Defense Professor was, and that the man had\nliterally sneezed at all attempts to uncover his true\nidentity. Why, no, they hadn't released 'Quirinus\nQuirrell' back to Hogwarts just yet.",
      "Let us repeat this for emphasis:",
      "The Defense Professor.",
      "Was being detained.",
      "In a cell.",
      "The Defense Professor was staring at the watching Auror and\nhumming.",
      "The Defense Professor has not spoken a single word since he\narrived in this particular cell. He has only been\nhumming.",
      "The humming started as a simple children's lullaby, the one that\nin Muggle Britain begins, Lullaby, and goodnight...",
      "This tune was hummed, without variation, over and over, for\nseven minutes, to establish the underlying pattern.",
      "Then began the elaborations upon the theme. Phrases hummed too\nslow, with long pauses in between, so that the listener's mind\nhelplessly waits and waits for the next note, the next phrase. And\nthen, when that next phrase comes, it is so out of key, so\nunbelievably awfully out of key, not just out of key for the\nprevious phrases but sung at a pitch which does not correspond to\nany key, that you would have to believe this person had\nspent hours deliberately practicing their humming just to acquire\nsuch perfect anti-pitch.",
      "It bears the same semblance to music as the awful dead voice of\na Dementor bears to human speech.",
      "And this horrible, horrible humming is impossible to\nignore. It is similar to a known lullaby, but it departs from that\npattern unpredictably. It sets up expectations and then violates\nthem, never in any constant pattern that would permit the humming\nto fade into the background. The listener's brain cannot prevent\nitself from expecting the anti-musical phrases to complete, nor\nprevent itself from noticing the surprises.",
      "The only possible explanation for how this mode of humming came\nto exist is that it was deliberately designed by some unspeakably\ncruel genius who woke up one day, feeling bored with ordinary\ntorture, who decided to handicap himself and find out whether he\ncould break someone's sanity just by humming at them.",
      "The Auror has been listening to this unimaginably dreadful\nhumming for four hours, while being stared at by a huge, cold,\nlethal presence that feels equally horrible whether he looks at it\ndirectly or lets it hover at the corner of his vision -",
      "The humming stopped.",
      "There was a long wait. Time enough for false hope to rise, and\nbe squashed down by the memory of previous disappointments. And\nthen, as the interval lengthened, and lengthened, that hope rose\nagain unstoppably -",
      "The humming began once more.",
      "The Auror cracked.",
      "From his belt, the Auror took a mirror, tapped it once, and then\nsaid, \"This is Junior Auror Arjun Altunay, I'm calling in code\nRJ-L20 on cell three.\"",
      "\"Code RJ-L20?\" the mirror said in surprised tones. There was a\nsound of pages being flipped, then, \"You want to be relieved\nbecause a prisoner is attempting psychological warfare and\nsucceeding?\"",
      "(Amelia Bones really is quite intelligent.)",
      "\"What'd the prisoner say to you?\" said the mirror.",
      "(This question is not part of procedure RJ-L20, but\nunfortunately Amelia Bones has failed to include an explicit\ninstruction that the commanding officer should not ask.)",
      "\"He's -\" said the Auror, and glanced back at the cell. The\nDefense Professor was now leaning in back in his chair, looking\nquite relaxed. \"He was staring at me! And\nhumming!\u202f\"",
      "There was a pause.",
      "The mirror spoke again. \"And you're calling in an RJ-L20 over\nthat? You're sure you're not just trying to get out of watching\nhim?\"",
      "(Amelia Bones is surrounded by idiots.)",
      "\"You don't understand!\" yelled Auror Altunay. \"It's really awful\nhumming!\"",
      "The mirror transmitted a sound of muffled laughter in the\nbackground, sounding like it was coming from more than one person.\nThen speech again. \"Mr. Altunay, if you don't want to be busted to\nJunior Auror Second Class, I suggest you buckle down and get back\nto work -\"",
      "\"Strike that,\" a crisp voice said, sounding slightly remote due\nto its distance from the mirror.",
      "(Which is why Amelia Bones often sits in on a coordination\ncenter of the D.M.L.E. while doing her Ministry-required\npaperwork.)",
      "\"Auror Altunay,\" said the crisp voice, seeming to approach\ncloser to the mirror, \"you will be relieved shortly. Auror Ben\nGutierrez, the procedure for RJ-L20 does not say that you\nask why. It says that you relieve the Auror who calls it in.\nIf I find that Aurors seem to be abusing it, I\nwill modify the procedure to prevent its abuse -\" The mirror cut\noff abruptly.",
      "The Auror turned back to look triumphantly at where the current\nDefense Professor of Hogwarts was leaning back in his cushioned\nchair.",
      "That man then spoke the first words that had left his lips since\nhe entered the cell.",
      "\"Goodbye, Mr. Altunay,\" said the Defense Professor.",
      "A few minutes later, the door to the detention cell opened, and\nin walked a grey-haired woman, dressed in the crimson-tinged robes\nof an Auror without any sign of rank or other ornamentation,\ncarrying a black leather folder under her left arm. \"You're\nrelieved,\" the old woman said abruptly.",
      "There was a brief delay while Auror Altunay tried to explain\nwhat had been happening. This was cut short by a nod and a stark,\nsimple finger pointing out the door.",
      "\"Good evening, Madam Director,\" said the Defense Professor.",
      "Amelia Bones did not acknowledge this statement, but sat down\nabruptly in the vacated chair. The old witch opened the black\nfolder and her gaze moved down to the parchments therein. \"Possible\nhints to the identity of the current Hogwarts Defense Professor, as\ncompiled by Auror Robards.\" The title parchment was turned, flipped\naside. \"The Defense Professor said that he was Sorted into\nSlytherin. Claimed that his family was killed by Voldemort. Said he\nhad studied at a martial arts center in Muggle Asia which was\ndestroyed by Voldemort. A request filed with the Department of\nInternational Magical Cooperation identifies this incident as the\nOni Affair of 1969.\" Another parchment was flipped aside. \"It also\nseems this Defense Professor gave a most stirring speech to his\nstudents, just before last Yule, castigating the previous\ngeneration for their disunity against the Death Eaters.\" The old\nwitch looked up from the leather folder. \"Madam Longbottom was\nrather taken with it, and insisted that I read the entire thing.\nThe argument struck me as familiar, though I could not place it at\nthe time. But then, of course, I had thought you dead.\"",
      "The chief law enforcement officer of Magical Britain was now\ngazing sharply at the current Defense Professor of Hogwarts, across\nthe pane of spell-reinforced glass separating them. The man in the\ncell returned the gaze equably, without apparent alarm.",
      "\"I shall not name any names,\" said the old witch. \"But I shall\ntell a story, and see if it sounds familiar.\" Amelia Bones looked\nback down, turning to the next parchment. \"Born 1927, entered\nHogwarts in 1938, sorted into Slytherin, graduated 1945. Went on a\ngraduation tour abroad and disappeared while visiting Albania.\nPresumed dead until 1970, when he returned to magical Britain just\nas suddenly, without any explanation for the missing twenty-five\nyears. He remained estranged from his family and friends, living in\nisolation. In 1971, while visiting Diagon Alley, he fended off an\nattempt by Bellatrix Black to kidnap the daughter of the Minister\nof Magic, and used the Killing Curse to slay two of the three Death\nEaters accompanying her. Beyond this all Britain knows the story;\nneed I continue it?\" The old witch looked up from her folder again.\n\"Very well. There was a trial in the Wizengamot, during which this\nyoung man was exonerated for his use of the Killing Curse, not\nleast due to the efforts of his grandmother, the Lady of his House.\nHe was reconciled with his family, and they held a House gathering\nto welcome his return. The guest of honor arrived at that gathering\nto find his entire family slain by Death Eaters, even to the house\nelves; and that he himself, of cadet line, was now the last\nremaining scion of a Most Ancient House.\"",
      "The Defense Professor had not reacted at all to any of this,\nexcept that his eyes had half-closed, as though in weariness.",
      "\"The young man took up his family's seat in the Wizengamot,\nbecoming among the most steadfast voices against You-Know-Who.\nSeveral times he led forces against the Death Eaters, fighting with\nskillful tactics and extraordinary power. People began to speak of\nhim as the next Dumbledore, it was thought that he might become\nMinister of Magic after the Dark Lord fell. On the third of July,\n1973, he failed to appear at a key Wizengamot vote, and was never\nheard from again. We assumed You-Know-Who had killed him. It was a\ngrave blow to all of us, and matters went much the worse from that\nday on.\" The old witch's gaze was questioning. \"I mourned you\nmyself. What happened?\"",
      "The Defense Professor's shoulders moved lightly, a small shrug.\n\"You make many assumptions,\" the Defense Professor said softly.\n\"For myself, I would believe that man died years ago. But if that\nman is nonetheless alive - then it is clear he does not wish the\nfact announced, and has reasons enough for silence. That man was\nonce of some help to you, it seems.\" The Defense Professor's lips\ncurved in a cynical smile. \"But I am no longer surprised when\ngratitude is fleeting. Is there yet more that you would demand from\nhim?\"",
      "The old witch leaned back in her Auror's monitoring-chair,\nlooking rather startled, maybe even hurt. \"No -\" she said after a\nmoment. Her fingers tapped the leather folder; nervously,\nyou might have thought, if you had believed that Amelia Bones could\never be nervous. \"But your House - there are not many\nAncient Houses remaining -\"",
      "\"It shall matter little to this country whether eight Ancient\nHouses remain, or seven.\"",
      "The old witch sighed. \"What does Dumbledore think of this?\"",
      "The man in the detention cell shook his head. \"He does not know\nwho I am, and promised not to inquire.\"",
      "The old witch's eyebrows rose. \"How did he identify you to the\nHogwarts wards, then?\"",
      "A slight smile. \"The Headmaster drew a circle, and told Hogwarts\nthat he who stood within was the Defense Professor. Speaking of\nwhich -\" The tone went lower, flatter. \"I am missing my classes,\nDirector Bones.\"",
      "\"You seem to - rest, sometimes, in a peculiar manner.\nThis has also been reported. And you seem to be resting\nmore and more frequently, as time goes on.\" The old witch's fingers\ntapped the leather folder again. \"I cannot recall reading of such a\nsymptom, but when one hears of such a thing, one imagines... Dark\nWizards fought, and terrible curses received...\"",
      "The Defense Professor remained expressionless.",
      "\"Do you require a healer's help?\" said Amelia Bones. Her own\nmask had slipped, clearly showing the pain in her eyes. \"Is there\nanything at all that can be done for you?\"",
      "\"I agreed to teach Defense at Hogwarts,\" the man in the cell\nsaid flatly. \"Draw your own conclusions, Madam. And I am missing my\nclasses, of which there are not many left. I would return to\nHogwarts, now.\"",
      "When Hermione woke the third time (though it felt like she'd\nonly closed her eyes for a moment) the Sun was even lower in the\nsky, almost fully set. She felt a little more alive and, strangely,\neven more exhausted. This time it was Professor Flitwick who was\nstanding next to her bed and shaking her shoulder, a tray of\nsteaming food floating next to him. For some reason she'd thought\nHarry Potter ought to be leaning over her bedside, but he wasn't\nthere. Had she dreamed that? She couldn't remember dreaming.",
      "It developed (according to Professor Flitwick) that Hermione had\nmissed dinner in the Great Hall, and was being woken to eat. And\nthen she could go back to the Ravenclaw dorm, and her own bed, to\nsleep the rest of the night.",
      "She ate in silence. There was a part of her that wanted to ask\nProfessor Flitwick whether he thought she'd been\nMemory-Charmed or she'd tried to kill Draco Malfoy of her own will\n-",
      "- like she remembered doing -",
      "- but most of her was afraid to find out. Afraid to find\nout was a warning sign, according to Harry Potter and his\nbooks; but her mind felt tired, bruised, and she couldn't\nmuster the strength to override it.",
      "When she and Professor Flitwick left the infirmary they found\nHarry Potter sitting cross-legged outside the door, quietly reading\na psychology textbook.",
      "\"I'll take her from here,\" said the Boy-Who-Lived. \"Professor\nMcGonagall said it would be all right.\"",
      "Professor Flitwick seemed to accept this, and departed after a\nstern look at both of them. She couldn't imagine what the stern\nlook was supposed to say, unless it was don't try to kill any\nmore students.",
      "The footsteps of Professor Flitwick faded, and the two of them\nstood alone outside the doors of the infirmary.",
      "She looked at the green eyes of the Boy-Who-Lived, the mess of\nhair that didn't quite obscure the scar on his forehead; she looked\nupon the face of the boy who'd given all his money to save her\nwithout a second thought. There were feelings inside her - guilt,\nshame, embarrassment, other things as well - but no words. There\nwas nothing she knew how to say.",
      "\"So,\" Harry said abruptly, \"I did a quick skim through my\npsychology books to see what they said about post-traumatic stress\ndisorder. The old books said you should talk about the experience\nimmediately afterward with a counselor. The newer research says\nthat when they actually ran experiments, it turned out that talking\nabout it immediately afterward made it worse. Apparently what you\nreally ought to do is run with your mind's natural impulse to\nrepress the memories and just not think about it for a while.\"",
      "It was so normal for the way she and Harry usually\ntalked that she felt a sudden burning in her throat.",
      "We don't have to talk about it. That was what Harry had\njust said, more or less. It felt like cheating, maybe even like a\nlie. Nothing was normal. Everything wrong was still\nhorribly wrong, everything left unsaid still needed to be\nsaid...",
      "\"Okay,\" said Hermione, because there wasn't anything else to\nsay, anything else at all.",
      "\"I'm sorry I wasn't waiting when you woke up,\" Harry said, as\nthey started to walk. \"Madam Pomfrey wouldn't let me in, so I just\nstayed out here.\" He gave a small, sad-looking shrug. \"I suppose I\nshould be out there trying to run damage control on public\nrelations, but... honestly I've never been good at that, I just end\nup speaking sharply at people.\"",
      "\"How bad is it?\" She thought her voice should have come out in a\nwhisper, a croak, but it didn't.",
      "\"Well -\" Harry said with obvious hesitation. \"The thing you've\ngot to understand, Hermione, is that you had a lot of defenders at\nbreakfast-time today, but everyone on your side was... making\nstuff up. Draco tried to kill you first, things like that. It\nwas Granger versus Malfoy, that's how people saw it, like a seesaw\nwhere pushing his side down meant pushing your side up. I told them\nyou were probably both innocent, that you'd both been\nMemory-Charmed. They didn't listen, both sides treated me like a\ntraitor trying to play the middle. And then people heard that Draco\nhad testified under Veritaserum that he'd been trying to help you\nbefore the battle - stop making that expression, Hermione, you\ndidn't actually do anything to him. Anyway, all people understood\nwas that the pro-Malfoy faction had been right and the pro-Granger\nfaction had been wrong.\" Harry gave a small sigh. \"I told\nthem that when the truth came out later they'd be\nembarrassed...\"",
      "\"How bad is it?\" she said again. This time her voice did come\nout weaker.",
      "\"Remember Asch's conformity experiment?\" Harry said, turning his\nhead to give her a serious look.",
      "Her mind was slow to remember for a few seconds, which\nfrightened her, but then the reference came back. In 1951, Solomon\nAsch had taken some experimental subjects, and each one had been\nput among a row of other people who looked like them, seeming like\nother experimental subjects, but actually confederates of the\nexperimenter. They'd shown a reference line on a screen, labeled X,\nnext to three other lines, labeled A, B, and C. The experimenter\nhad asked which line X was the same length as. The correct answer\nhad obviously been C. The other 'subjects', the confederates, had\none after another said that X was the same length as B. The real\nsubject had been put second-to-last in the order, so as not to\narouse suspicion by being last. The test had been to see whether\nthe real subject would 'conform' to the standard wrong answer of B,\nor voice the obviously correct answer of C.",
      "75% of the subjects had 'conformed' at least once. A third of\nthe subjects had conformed more than half the time. Some had\nreported afterward actually believing that X was the same length as\nB. And that had been in a case where the subjects hadn't known any\nof the confederates. If you put people around others who belonged\nto the same group as them, like someone in a wheelchair next to\nother people in a wheelchair, the conformity effect got even\nstronger...",
      "Hermione had a sickening feeling where this was going. \"I\nremember,\" she whispered.",
      "\"I gave the Chaos Legion anti-conformity training, you know. I\nhad each Legionnaire stand in the middle and say 'Twice two is\nfour!' or 'Grass is green!' while everyone else in the Chaos Legion\ncalled them idiots or sneered at them - Allen Flint did really good\nsneers - or even just gave them blank looks and then walked away.\nThe thing you've got to remember is, only the Chaos Legion\nhas ever practiced anything like that. Nobody else in Hogwarts even\nknows what conformity is.\"",
      "\"Harry!\" Her voice was wobbling. \"How bad is it?\"",
      "Harry gave another sad-looking shrug. \"Everyone in the second\nyear and above, since they don't know you. Everyone in Dragon Army.\nAll of Slytherin, of course. And, well, most of the rest of magical\nBritain too, I think. Remember, Lucius Malfoy controls the\nDaily Prophet.\"",
      "\"Everyone?\" she whispered. Her limbs had started to feel cold,\nlike she'd just gotten out of an unheated swimming pool.",
      "\"What people really believe doesn't feel like a belief,\nit feels like the way the world is.

      "\"- thinks he's ethically prohibited from being your friend now,\nwell, he's trying to do the right thing as he understands it, in\nthe world he thinks he lives in.\" Harry's eyes were very serious.\n\"Hermione, you've told me a lot of times that I look down too much\non other people. But if I expected too much of them - if I expected\npeople to get things right - I really would hate them,\nthen. Idealism aside, Hogwarts students don't actually\nknow enough cognitive science to take responsibility for how their\nown minds work. It's not their fault they're crazy.\" Harry's voice\nwas strangely gentle, almost like an adult's. \"I know it's going to\nbe harder on you than it would be on me. But remember, eventually\nthe real culprit gets nailed. The truth comes out, everyone who was\nconfidently wrong gets embarrassed.\"",
      "\"And if the real culprit doesn't get caught?\" she said in a\ntrembling voice.",
      "...or if it turns out to be me after all?",
      "\"Then you can leave Hogwarts and go to the Salem Witches'\nInstitute in America.\"",

      "\"I'll...\" she stammered. \"I'll have... to think about it...\"",
      "Harry nodded. \" At least nobody's going to try hexing you, not\nafter what the Headmaster said at dinner tonight.

      "If Hermione didn't burst into tears, then, it was only because\nshe'd expected it, had played it out in her mind over and over\nagain. At least people weren't screaming at her or shoving her or\nhexing her. They were just looking away -",
      "Hermione walked very straight up to the staircaise that led\ntoward the first-year girl's dorms.

      "She should go to her room and sleep, but she was afraid to go\nsomeplace where other people were. Afraid of how they might look at\nher, or look away.",
      "Fragments of thought chased themselves around a mind too\nexhausted to finish or connect them, as the night fully set in.",
      "Why -",
      "Why did all this happen -",
      "Everything was fine a week ago -",
      "Why -",
      "From behind her came the creaky sound of an opening door.",
      "She turned her head and looked.",
      "Professor Quirrell was leaning against the doorway she'd walked\nthrough, silhouetted like a cardboard cutout by the light of the\nHogwarts torches lit behind him, in the open door. She couldn't see\nhis expression, though the doorway behind him was bright; his eyes,\nhis face, everything she could see from here lay within night's\nshadow.",
      "The Defense Professor of Hogwarts, number one on the list of\npeople who might've done this. She hadn't even realized she\nhad a suspect list until that moment.",
      "The man stood within that doorway, saying nothing; and she\ncouldn't see his eyes. What was he even doing there in the\nfirst place -",
      "\"Are you here to kill me?\" said Hermione Granger.",
      "Professor Quirrell's head tilted at that.",
      "Then the Defense Professor started toward her, the dark\nsilhouette raising one hand slowly and deliberately, as though to\npush her off the Ravenclaw tower -",
      "\"Stupefy!\u202f\"",
      "The burst of adrenaline overrode everything, she drew her wand\nwithout thinking, her lips formed the word of their own accord, the\nstunbolt leapt out of her wand and -",
      "- slowed to a stop in front of Professor Quirrell's\nraised hand, rippling in midair like it was still trying to fly and\nmaking a slight hissing sound.",
      "The red glow illuminated Professor Quirrell's face for the first\ntime, showing a strange fond smile.",
      "\"Better,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"Miss Granger, you are still\na student in my Defense class. As such, if you consider me a\nthreat, I do not expect you to just look at me sadly and ask if I\nam there to kill you. Minus two Quirrell points.\"",
      "She was entirely unable to form words.",
      "The Defense Professor flicked his forefinger casually at the\nsuspended stunbolt, sending the hex shooting back over her head,\nfar into the night, so that they stood again in darkness. Then\nProfessor Quirrell walked out of the doorway, which swung shut\nbehind him; and a soft white light sprung up around the two of\nthem, so that she could see his face once more, still with that\nstrange fond smile.",
      "\"What are you - what are you doing here?\"",
      "A few more steps took Professor Quirrell to a higher part of the\nbalcony's ramparts, where he put his elbows down on the stone, and\nleaned over heavily, looking up into the night.",
      "\"I came here straight upon being released by the Aurors, the\nmoment I finished reporting to the Headmaster,\" said Professor\nQuirrell in a quiet voice, \"because I am your teacher, and you are\nmy student, and I am responsible for you.\"",
      "Hermione understood, then; remembering what Professor Quirrell\nhad said to Harry in the second Defense lesson of the year, about\ncontrolling his anger. She felt the flush of shame all the way down\nher chest. It took a moment after that for knowledge to override\nmortification, for her to force out the words -",
      "\"I -\" said Hermione. \"Harry thinks - that I didn't -\nlose my temper, I mean -\"",
      "\"So I heard,\" said Professor Quirrell in rather dry tones. He\nshook his head, as though at the stars themselves. \"The boy is\nfortunate that I have crossed the line from annoyance with his\nself-destructiveness, into sheer curiosity as to what he shall do\nnext. But I agree with Mr. Potter's assessment of the facts. This\nmurder was well-planned to evade detection both by the wards of\nHogwarts and the Headmaster's timely eye. Naturally, in such a\nthoughtful murder, some innocent would be placed to take the\nblame.\" A brief, wry smile crossed the Defense Professor's lips,\nthough he wasn't looking at her. \"As for the notion that you did it\nyourself - I consider myself a talented teacher, but even I could\nnot teach such murderous intent to a student as obstinate and\nuntalented as Hermione Granger.\"",
      "The part of her brain that said What? in indignation\nwasn't anywhere near loud enough to reach her lips.",
      "\"No...\" said Professor Quirrell. \"That is not why I am here. You\nhave made no effort to hide your dislike for me, Miss Granger. I\nthank you for that lack of pretense, for I much prefer true hate to\nfalse love. But you are still my student, and I have a word to say\nto you, if you will hear it.\"",
      "Hermione looked at him, still fighting down the aftereffects of\nthe adrenaline from before. The Defense Professor seemed to be just\nstaring up at the dark sky, in which the stars were becoming\nvisible.",
      "\"I was going to be a hero, once,\" said Professor Quirrell, still\nlooking upward. \"Can you believe that, Miss Granger?\"",
      "\"No.\"",
      "\"Thank you again, Miss Granger. It is true nonetheless. Long\nago, long before your time or Harry Potter's, there was a man who\nwas hailed as a savior. The destined scion, such a one as anyone\nwould recognize from tales, wielding justice and vengeance like\ntwin wands against his dreadful nemesis.\" Professor Quirrell gave a\nsoft, bitter laugh, looking up at the night sky. \"Do you know, Miss\nGranger, at that time I thought myself already cynical, and yet...\nwell.\"",
      "The silence stretched, in the cold and the night.",
      "\"In all honesty,\" said Professor Quirrell, looking up at the\nstars, \"I still don't understand it. They should have known that\ntheir lives depended on that man's success. And yet it was as if\nthey tried to do everything they could to make his life\nunpleasant. To throw every possible obstacle into his way.\nI was not naive, Miss Granger, I did not expect the power-holders\nto align themselves with me so quickly - not without something in\nit for themselves. But their power, too, was threatened; and so I\nwas shocked how they seemed content to step back, and leave to that\nman all burdens of responsibility. They sneered at his performance,\nremarking among themselves how they would do better in his place,\nthough they did not condescend to step forward.\" Professor Quirrell\nshook his head as though in bemusement. \"And it was the strangest\nthing - the Dark Wizard, that man's dread nemesis - why, those who\nserved him leapt eagerly to their tasks. The Dark Wizard\ngrew crueler toward his followers, and they followed him all the\nmore. Men fought for the chance to serve him, even as\nthose whose lives depended on that other man made free to render\nhis life difficult... I could not understand it, Miss Granger.\"\nProfessor Quirrell's face was in shadow, as he looked upward.\n\"Perhaps, by taking on himself the curse of action, that man\nremoved it from all others? Was that why they felt free to hinder\nhis battle against the Dark Wizard who would have enslaved them\nall? Believing men would act in their own interest was not\ncynicism, it turned out, but sheerest optimism; in reality men do\nnot meet so high a standard. And so in time that one realized he\nmight do better fighting the Dark Wizard alone, than with such\nfollowers at his back.\"",
      "\"So -\" Hermione's voice sounded strange in the night. \"You left\nyour friends behind where they'd be safe, and tried to attack the\nDark Wizard all by yourself?\"",
      "\"Why, no,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"I stopped trying to be a\nhero, and went off to do something else I found more pleasant.\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" said Hermione without thinking at all. \"That's\nhorrible!\u202f\"",
      "The Defense Professor turned his head down from the sky to\nregard her; and she saw, in the light of the doorway, that he was\nsmiling - or at least half his face was smiling. \"Are you going to\ntell me, Miss Granger, that I am an awful person? Well, perhaps I\nam. But then are people who never even try to be heroes still\nworse? If I had never done anything at all, like them, would you\nhave thought better of me?\"",
      "Hermione opened her mouth and then found that, once again, she\ndidn't have anything to say. It wasn't right to walk away from\nbeing a hero, you couldn't just do that, but she didn't\nwant to say that everyone who wasn't a hero was nothing,\nthat was Quirrell-thinking...",
      "The smile, or half-smile, had disappeared. \"You were foolish,\"\nthe Defense Professor said quietly, \"to expect any lasting\ngratitude from those you tried to protect, once you named yourself\na heroine. Just as you expected that man to go on being a hero, and\ncalled him horrible for stopping, when a thousand others never\nlifted a finger. It was only expected that you should\nfight bullies. It was a tax you owed, and they accepted it like\nprinces, with a sneer for the lateness of your payment. And you\nhave already witnessed, I wager, that their fondness vanished like\ndust in the wind once it was no longer in their interest to\nassociate with you...\"",
      "The Defense Professor slowly straightened off the balcony,\nstanding almost straight, turning to regard her fully.",
      "\"But you don't have to be a hero, Miss Granger,\" said Professor\nQuirrell. \"You can stop anytime you please.\"",
      "That idea...",
      "...had occurred to her before, several times over the\nlast two days.",
      "People become who they are meant to be, by doing what is\nright, Headmaster Dumbledore had told her. The trouble was\nthat there seemed to be two different right things to do. There was\nthe part of her which said that right was to go on being a\nheroine, and stay at Hogwarts, she didn't know what was going on\nbut a heroine wouldn't just run away.",
      "And there was also the voice of common sense saying that young\nchildren shouldn't ever stay around danger, that was what adults\nwere for; the voice of every school poster that said not to take\ncandy from strangers. That was also right.",
      "Hermione Granger stood there on that balcony, looking at\nProfessor Quirrell silhouetted by the emerging stars, and she\ndidn't understand; she didn't understand how the Defense Professor\ncould be gazing at her with his face showing concern; she didn't\nunderstand the notes of pain in the Defense Professor's voice that\ncaught at her; she didn't understand why she was being\ntold all this.",
      "\"You don't even like me, Professor,\" said Hermione.",
      "A small smile flickered on Professor Quirrell's face. \"I suppose\nI could go on about how I am angered that this affair has taken up\nmy valuable time and disrupted my Defense classes. But mostly, Miss\nGranger, you are my student, and whatever other professions I may\nhave once held, I think I have been a good teacher at Hogwarts,\nhave I not?\" Suddenly Professor Quirrell's eyes seemed very tired.\n\"As your teacher, then, I am advising you that you have other\ncareer options. I should not like to see anyone else going down my\npath.\"",
      "Hermione swallowed. It was a side of Professor Quirrell she'd\nnever seen or imagined, and it was eating away at her\npreconceptions.",
      "Professor Quirrell watched her for a moment, and then looked\naway from her again, back up at the stars. When he spoke this time\nhis voice was quieter. \"Someone here is targeting you, Miss\nGranger, and I cannot ward you as I warded Mr. Malfoy. The\nHeadmaster has prevented it, for what he claims to be good reasons.\nIt is easy to become fond of Hogwarts, I know, for I am fond of it\nas well. But in France they take a different view of the Ancient\nHouses than in Britain; and Beauxbatons would not mistreat you, I\nthink. Whatever else you imagine of me, I swear that if you asked\nme to see you safely in Beauxbatons, I would do all in my power to\nconvey you there.\"",
      "\"I can't just -\" Hermione said.",
      "\"But you can, Miss Granger.\" Now the pale blue eyes\nwatched her intently. \"Whatever you wish to make of your life, you\ncannot attain it at Hogwarts, not anymore. This place is ruined for\nyou now, even leaving aside all other threats. Simply ask Harry\nPotter to command you to go to Beauxbatons and live out your life\nin peace. If you stay here, he is your master in the eyes of\nBritain and its laws!\"",
      "She hadn't even been thinking about that, it paled so much in\ncomparison to being eaten by Dementors; it had been important to\nher before, but now it all seemed childish, unimportant, pointless,\nso why were her eyes burning?",
      "\"And if that fails to move you, Miss Granger, consider also that\nMr. Potter has, just today at lunchtime, threatened Lucius Malfoy,\nAlbus Dumbledore, and the entire Wizengamot because he cannot think\nsensibly when something threatens to take you from him. Are you not\nfrightened of what he will do next?\"",
      "It made sense. Terrible sense. Dreadful awful sense.",
      "It made too much sense -",
      "She couldn't have described it in words, what triggered the\nrealization, unless it was the sheer pressure that the\nDefense Professor was exerting on her.",
      "That if the Defense Professor was behind this whole\nthing - then Professor Quirrell had done it all just to get her\nout of the way of his plans for Harry.",
      "Without any conscious decision, she shifted her weight to the\nother foot, her body moving away from the Defense Professor -",
      "\"So you think I am the one responsible?\" said Professor\nQuirrell. His voice sounded a little sad as he said it, and her own\nheart almost stopped from hearing it. \"I suppose I cannot blame\nyou. I am the Defense Professor of Hogwarts, after all. But Miss\nGranger, even assuming that I am your enemy, common sense\nshould still tell you to get away from me very quickly.\nYou cannot use the Killing Curse, so the correct tactic is to\nApparate away. I do not mind being the villain of your imagination\nif it makes matters clearer. Leave Hogwarts, and leave me to those\nwho can handle me. I will arrange for the transportation to be\nthrough some family of good repute, and Mr. Potter will know to\nblame me if you do not arrive safely.\"",
      "\"I -\" She was feeling cold, the night air chilling her skin, or\nmaybe being chilled by it. \"I've got to think about it -\"",
      "Professor Quirrell shook his head. \"No, Miss Granger. Your\ndeparture will take time for me to arrange, and I have less time\nleft than you may think. This decision may be painful for you, but\nit should not be ambiguous; much weighs in the balance of these\nscales, but not evenly. I must know tonight whether you intend to\ngo.\"",
      "And if not -",
      "Was the Defense Professor warning her deliberately? That if she\ndidn't run, he would strike again?",
      "Why would it matter so much, what did Professor Quirrell want to\ndo with Harry?",
      "Hermione Granger, I shall be less subtle than is usual for a\nmysterious old wizard, and tell you outright that you cannot\nimagine how badly things could go if the events\nsurrounding Harry Potter turn to ill.",
      "The most powerful wizard in the world had told her that, when he\nwas talking about how important it was that she not stop\nbeing Harry's friend.",
      "Hermione swallowed, she swayed a little where she stood, on the\nstone balcony of a magical castle. Suddenly the whole deadly\nabsurdity of the situation seemed to rise up and grab her by the\nthroat, that twelve-year-old girls shouldn't be in danger,\nshouldn't be thinking about such things, that Mum would\nwant her to RUN AWAY and her father would have a heart attack if he\neven knew she was being faced with the question.",
      "And she knew, then, as Harry and Dumbledore had both tried to\nwarn her, that everything she'd ever thought about being a heroine\nhad been mistaken. That there wasn't really any such thing as\nheroes, outside of stories. There was just horrible danger, and\nbeing arrested by Aurors and put in cells next to Dementors, pain\nand fear and -",
      "\"Miss Granger?\" said the Defense Professor.",
      "She said nothing. All the words were blocked in her throat.",
      "\"I need a decision, Miss Granger.\"",
      "She kept her jaw locked, didn't let any words come out.",
      "Finally the Defense Professor sighed. Slowly the white light\nfailed, and slowly the door behind him swung open, so that he was\nonce again a black silhouette against the opening. \"Good night,\nMiss Granger,\" he said, and turned his back to her, and walked away\ninto Hogwarts.",
      "It took a while for her breathing to slow down again. Whatever\nhad happened here tonight, it didn't feel anything like victory.\nShe'd fought so hard just to stop herself from saying Yes\nin the face of the Defense Professor's pressure, and now she didn't\neven know if she'd done the right thing.",
      "When she walked back into the light herself (after exhaustion\nhad overtaken everything and sleep was once more a possibility),\nshe thought she heard it as she was within the doorway, from behind\nher and above her, a distant cawing cry.",
      "But it wasn't meant for her, she knew, so she started climbing\nup the stairs toward her dorm room.",
      "The other girls were probably asleep by now, and wouldn't look\nat her, or look away -",
      "She felt the tears start, and this time she didn't stop\nthem."

      "This chapter received a major, significiant revision on\nDecember 16th, 2012. The main revision starts about halfway through\n- search on the word \"trivial\" to find it.",
      "Slow and hard, the long stairway that led to the peak of\nRavenclaw. From the inside, the stairway seemed like a straight\nupward slope, though from the outside you could see that it\nlogically had to be a spiral. You could only get to the top of the\nRavenclaw tower by making that long climb without shortcuts, stone\nstep by stone step; passing beneath Harry's shoes, pushed down by\nhis wearying legs.",
      "Harry had seen Hermione safely off to bed.",
      "He had lingered in the Ravenclaw common room long enough to\ncollect a few signatures that might be useful to Hermione later.\nNot many students had signed; wizards hadn't been trained to think\nin the put-up-or-shut-up,\nstick-your-neck-out-and-make-a-prediction-or-stop-pretending-to-believe-in-your-theory\nrules of Muggle science. Most of them hadn't seen anything\nincongruent about being too nervous to sign an agreement\nsaying that Hermione got to hold it over them for the rest of their\nlives if they were wrong, while acting outwardly confident that she\nwas guilty. But just having demanded the signatures would make the\npoint after the truth came out, if anyone ever again suspected\nHermione of anything Dark. She wouldn't have to go through this\ntwice, at least.",
      "After that Harry had left the common room quickly, because all\nthe kindly forgiving sentiments he'd reasoned out were getting\nharder and harder to remember. Sometimes Harry thought the deepest\nsplit in his personality wasn't anything to do with his dark side;\nrather it was the divide between the altruistic and forgiving\nAbstract Reasoning Harry, versus the frustrated and angry Harry In\nThe Moment.",
      "The circular platform at the top of the Ravenclaw tower wasn't\nthe tallest place in Hogwarts, but the Ravenclaw tower jutted out\nfrom the main body of the castle, so you couldn't see down into the\ntop platform from the Astronomy tower. A quiet place to think, if\nyou had an awful lot to think about. A place where few other\nstudents ever came - there were easier niches of privacy, if\nprivacy was all you wanted.",
      "The night-lit torches of Hogwarts were far below. The platform\nitself offered few obstructions; the stairs emerged from an\nuncovered gap in the floor, rather than an upright door. From this\nplace, then, the stars were as visible as they ever were on\nEarth.",
      "The boy lay down in the center of the platform, heedless of his\nrobes that might be dirtied, dropping his head to rest upon the\nrock-tiled floor; so that, except for a few half-seen crenellations\nof stone at vision's edge, and a sliver of crescent moon, reality\nbecame starlight.",
      "The pinpoints of light in dark velvet twinkled, wavering and\nreturning, a different kind of beauty from their steady brilliance\nin the Silent Night.",
      "Harry gazed out abstractly, his mind on other things.",
      "This day your war against Voldemort has begun...",
      "Dumbledore had said that, after the Incident with Rescuing\nBellatrix from Azkaban. That had been a false alarm, but the phrase\nexpressed the sentiment well.",
      "Two nights ago his war had begun, and Harry didn't know with\nwho.",
      "Dumbledore thought it was Lord Voldemort, returned from the\ndead, making his first move against the boy who had defeated him\nlast time.",
      "Professor Quirrell had put detection wards on Draco, fearing\nthat Hogwarts's mad Headmaster would try to frame Harry for the\ndeath of Lucius's son.",
      "Or Professor Quirrell had set up the entire thing, and\nthat was how he'd known where to find Draco. Severus Snape\nthought the Hogwarts Defense Professor was an obvious suspect, even\nthe obvious suspect.",
      "And Severus Snape himself might or might not be even remotely\ntrustworthy.",
      "Someone had declared war against Harry, their first\nstrike had been meant to take out Draco and Hermione both, and it\nwas only by the barest of margins that Harry had saved\nHermione.",
      "You couldn't call it victory. Draco had been removed from\nHogwarts, and if that wasn't death, it wasn't clear how it could be\nundone, or what shape Draco might be in when he got back. The\ncountry of magical Britain now thought Hermione an\nattempted-murderer, which might or might not make her decide to do\nthe sane thing and leave. Harry had sacrificed his entire fortune\nto undo his loss, and that card could only be played once.",
      "Some unknown power had struck at him, and if that blow had been\npartially deflected, it had still hit really hard.",
      "At least his dark side hadn't asked anything of him in exchange\nfor saving Hermione. Maybe because his dark side wasn't an\nimaginary voice like Hufflepuff; Harry might imagine his\nHufflepuff part as wanting different things from himself, but his\ndark side wasn't like that. His \"dark side\", so far as Harry could\ntell, was a different way that Harry sometimes was. Right\nnow, Harry wasn't angry; and trying to ask what \"dark Harry\" wanted\nwas a phone ringing unanswered. The thought even seemed a little\nstrange; could you owe something to a different way you sometimes\nwere?",
      "Harry stared up at the random stars, the scattered twinkling\nlights that human brains couldn't help but pattern-match into\nimaginary constellations.",
      "And then there was that promise Harry had sworn.",
      "Draco to help Harry reform Slytherin House. And Harry to take as\nan enemy whomever Harry believed, in his best judgment as a\nrationalist, to have killed Narcissa Malfoy. If Narcissa had never\ngotten her own hands dirty, if indeed she'd been burned alive, if\nthe killer hadn't been tricked - those were all the conditions\nHarry could remember making. He probably should've written it down,\nor better yet, never made a promise requiring that many caveats in\nthe first place.",
      "There were plausible outs, for the sort of person who'd let\nthemselves rationalize an out. Dumbledore hadn't actually\nconfessed. He hadn't come right out and said he'd done it. There\nwere plausible reasons for an actually-guilty Dumbledore to behave\nthat way. But it was also what you'd expect to see, if\nsomeone else had burned Narcissa, and Dumbledore had taken\ncredit.",
      "Harry shook his head, flattening one side of his hair and then\nanother against the stone-tiled floor. There was still a final out,\nDraco could still release him from the oath at any time. He could,\nat least, describe the situation to Draco, and talk about options\nwith him, when they met again. It didn't seem like a very likely\nprospect for release - but the idea of talking something over\nhonestly was enough to satisfy the part of himself that demanded\nadherence to oaths. Even if it only meant delaying, it was better\nthan taking a good man as an enemy.",
      "But is Dumbledore a good man? asked the voice\nof Hufflepuff. If Dumbledore burned someone alive - wasn't the\nwhole point that good people may kill, but never kill with\nsuffering?",
      "Maybe he killed her instantly, said Slytherin, and\nthen lied to Lucius about the burning-alive part. But... if there\nwas any possibility of the Death Eaters magically\nverifying how Narcissa died... and if being caught in a lie\nwould've endangered Light-side families...",
      "Be careful what we cleverly rationalize, warned\nGryffindor.",
      "You have to expect reputational effects on how other people\ntreat you, said Hufflepuff. If you decide there's\nsufficient reason to burn a woman alive, one of the predictable\nside effects is that good people decide you've crossed the line and\nhave to be stopped. Dumbledore should've expected that. He's got no\nright to complain.",
      "Or maybe he expects us to be smarter, said Slytherin.\nNow that we know this much of the truth - no matter the exact\ndetails of the full story - can we really believe that Dumbledore\nis a terrible, terrible person who ought to be our enemy? In the\nmiddle of a horrible bloody war, Dumbledore set one enemy\ncivilian on fire? That's only bad by the standards of comic books,\nnot by any sort of realistic historical standard.",
      "Harry stared up at the night sky, remembering history.",
      "In real life, in real wars...",
      "During World War II, there had been a project to sabotage the\nNazi nuclear weapons program. Years earlier, Leo Szilard, the first\nperson to realize the possibility of a fission chain reaction, had\nconvinced Fermi not to publish the discovery that purified graphite\nwas a cheap and effective neutron moderator. Fermi had wanted to\npublish, for the sake of the great international project of\nscience, which was above nationalism. But Szilard had persuaded\nRabi, and Fermi had abided by the majority vote of their tiny\nthree-person conspiracy. And so, years later, the only neutron\nmoderator the Nazis had known about was deuterium.",
      "The only deuterium source under Nazi control had been a captured\nfacility in occupied Norway, which had been knocked out by bombs\nand sabotage, causing a total of twenty-four civilian deaths.",
      "The Nazis had tried to ship the deuterium already refined to\nGermany, aboard a civilian Norwegian ferry, the SS\nHydro.",
      "Knut Haukelid and his assistants had been discovered by the\nnight watchman of the civilian ferry while they were sneaking on\nboard to sabotage it. Haukelid had told the watchman that they were\nescaping the Gestapo, and the watchman had let them go. Haukelid\nhad considered warning the night watchman, but that would have\nendangered the mission, so Haukelid had only shaken his hand. And\nthe civilian ship had sunk in the deepest part of the lake, with\neight dead Germans, seven dead crew, and three dead civilian\nbystanders. Some of the Norwegian rescuers of the ship had thought\nthe German soldiers present should be left to drown, but this view\nhad not prevailed, and the German survivors had been rescued. And\nthat had been the end of the Nazi nuclear weapons program.",
      "Which was to say that Knut Haukelid had killed innocent people.\nOne of whom, the night watchman of the ship, had been a\ngood person. Someone who'd gone out of his way to help\nHaukelid, at risk to himself; from the kindness of his heart, for\nthe highest moral reasons; and been sent to drown in turn.\nAfterward, in the cold light of history, it had looked like the\nNazis had never been close to getting nuclear weapons after\nall.",
      "And Harry had never read anything suggesting that Haukelid had\nacted wrongly.",
      "That was war in real life. In terms of total damage and who'd\ngotten hit, what Haukelid had done was considerably worse\nthan what Dumbledore might have done to Narcissa Malfoy, or what\nDumbledore had possibly done to leak the prophecy to Lord Voldemort\nto get him to attack Harry's parents.",
      "If Haukelid had been a comic-book superhero, he'd have somehow\ngotten all the civilians off the ferry, he would've attacked the\nGerman soldiers directly...",
      "...rather than let a single innocent person die...",
      "...but Knut Haukelid hadn't been a superhero.",
      "And neither had been Albus Dumbledore.",
      "Harry closed his eyes, swallowing hard a few times against the\nsudden choking sensation. It was abruptly very clear that while\nHarry was going around trying to live the ideals of the\nEnlightenment, Dumbledore was the one who'd actually fought in\na war. Nonviolent ideals were cheap to hold if you were a\nscientist, living inside the Protego bubble cast by the\npolice officers and soldiers whose actions you had the luxury to\nquestion. Albus Dumbledore seemed to have started out with ideals\nat least as strong as Harry's own, if not stronger; and Dumbledore\nhadn't gotten through his war without killing enemies and\nsacrificing friends.",
      "Are you so much better than Haukelid and Dumbledore, Harry\nPotter, that you'll be able to fight without a single casualty?\nEven in the world of comic books, the only reason a superhero like\nBatman even looks successful is that the comic-book\nreaders only notice when Important Named Characters die, not when\nthe Joker shoots some random nameless bystander to show off his\nvillainy. Batman is a murderer no less than the Joker, for all the\nlives the Joker took that Batman could've saved by killing him.\nThat's what the man named Alastor was trying to tell Dumbledore,\nand afterward Dumbledore regretted having taken so long to change\nhis mind. Are you really going to try to follow the path of the\nsuperhero, and never sacrifice a single piece or kill a single\nenemy?",
      "Fatigued, Harry turned his attention away from the dilemma for a\nmoment, opened his eyes again to regard the hemisphere of night,\nwhich required no decisions from him.",
      "Near the edge of his vision, the pale white crescent of the\nMoon, the light from which had left one-and-a-quarter seconds ago,\naround 375,000 kilometers of distance in Earth's space of\nsimultaneity.",
      "Above and to the side, Polaris, the North Star; the first star\nHarry had learned to identify in the sky, by following the edge of\nthe Big Dipper. That was actually a five-star system with a\nbrilliant central supergiant, 434 light-years from Earth. It was\nthe first 'star' whose name Harry had ever learned from his father,\nso long ago that he couldn't have guessed how old he'd been.",
      "The dim fog that was the Milky Way, so many billions of distant\nstars that they became an indistinct river, the plane of a galaxy\nthat stretched 100,000 light-years across. If Harry had experienced\nany sense of wonder when he'd first been told that, he'd\nbeen too young for him to remember now that first time, across a\nfew years' distance.",
      "In the center of the constellation Andromeda, the star\nAndromeda, which was really the Andromeda Galaxy. The nearest\ngalaxy to the Milky Way, 2.4 million light-years away, containing\nan estimated trillion stars.",
      "Numbers like those made 'infinity' pale by comparison, because\n'infinity' was just featureless and blank. Thinking that the stars\nwere 'infinitely' distant was a lot less scary than trying to work\nout what 2.4 million light-years amounted to in meters. 2.4 million\nlight-years, times 31 million seconds in a year, times a photon\nmoving at 300,000,000 meters per second...",
      "It was strange to think that such distances might not\nbe unreachably far away. Magic was loose in the universe, things\nlike Time-Turners and broomsticks. Had any wizard ever tried to\nmeasure the speed of a portkey, or a phoenix?",
      "And the human understanding of magic couldn't possibly be\nanywhere near the underlying laws. What would you be able\nto do with magic if you really understood it?",
      "A year ago, Dad had gone to the Australian National University\nin Canberra for a conference where he'd been an invited speaker,\nand he'd taken Mum and Harry along. And they'd all visited the\nNational Museum of Australia, because, it had turned out, there was\nbasically nothing else to do in Canberra. The glass display cases\nhad shown rock-throwers crafted by the Australian aborigines - like\ngiant wooden shoehorns, they'd looked, but smoothed and carved and\nornamented with painstaking care. In the 40,000 years since\nanatomically modern humans had migrated to Australia from Asia,\nnobody had invented the bow-and-arrow. It really made you\nappreciate how non-obvious was the idea of Progress. Why\nwould you even think of Invention as something important, if all\nyour history's heroic tales were of great warriors and defenders\ninstead of Thomas Edison? How could anyone have suspected, while\ncarving a rock-thrower with painstaking care, that someday human\nbeings would invent rocket ships and nuclear energy?",
      "Could you have looked up into the sky, at the brilliant light of\nthe Sun, and deduced that the universe contained greater sources of\npower than mere fire? Would you have realized that if the\nfundamental physical laws permitted it, someday humans would tap\nthe same energies as the Sun? Even if nothing you could imagine\ndoing with rock-throwers or woven pouches - no pattern of running\nacross the savannah and nothing you could obtain by hunting animals\n- would accomplish that even in imagination?",
      "It wasn't like modern-day Muggles had gotten anywhere near the\nlimits of what Muggle physics said was possible. And yet like\nhunter-gatherers conceptually bound to their rock-throwers, most\nMuggles lived in a world defined by the limits of what you could do\nwith cars and telephones. Even though Muggle physics explicitly\npermitted possibilities like molecular nanotechnology or the\nPenrose process for extracting energy from black holes, most people\nfiled that away in the same section of their brain that stored\nfairy tales and history books, well away from their personal\nrealities: Long ago and far away, ever so long ago. No\nsurprise, then, that the wizarding world lived in a conceptual\nuniverse bounded - not by fundamental laws of magic that nobody\neven knew - but just by the surface rules of known Charms and\nenchantments. You couldn't observe the way magic was practiced\nnowadays and not be reminded of the National Museum of\nAustralia, once you realized what you were seeing. Even if Harry's\nfirst guess had been mistaken, one way or another it was still\ninconceivable that the fundamental laws of the universe\ncontained a special case for human lips shaping the phrase\n'Wingardium Leviosa'. And yet even that fumbling grasp of magic was\nenough to do things that Muggle physics said should be forever\nimpossible: the Time-Turner, water conjured out of nothingness\nby Aguamenti. What were the ultimate\npossibilities of invention, if the underlying laws of the universe\npermitted an eleven-year-old with a stick to violate almost every\nconstraint in the Muggle version of physics?",
      "Like a hunter-gatherer trying to look up at the Sun, and guess\nthat the universe had to be shaped in a way that allowed for\nnuclear energy...",
      "It made you wonder if maybe twenty thousand million million\nmillion meters wasn't so much distance, after all.",
      "There was a step beyond Abstract Reasoning Harry which he could\ntake, given time enough to compose himself and the right\nsurroundings; something beyond Abstract Reasoning Harry, as that\nwas beyond Harry In The Moment. Looking up at the stars, you could\ntry to imagine what the distant descendants of humanity would think\nof your dilemma - in a hundred million years, when the stars would\nhave spun through great galactic movements into entirely new\npositions, every constellation scattered. It was an elementary\ntheorem of probability that if you knew what your answer would be\nafter updating on future evidence, you ought to adopt that answer\nright now. If you knew your destination, you were already\nthere. And by analogy, if not quite by theorem, if you could guess\nwhat the descendants of humanity would think of something, you\nought to go ahead and take that as your own best guess.",
      "From that vantage point the idea of killing off two-thirds of\nthe Wizengamot seemed a lot less appealing than it had a few hours\nearlier. Even if you had to do it, even if you knew for a\nsolid fact that it would be the best thing for magical Britain and\nthat the complete Story of Time would look worse if you didn't do\nit... even as a necessity, the deaths of sentient beings would\nstill be a tragedy. One more element of the sorrows of Earth; the\nMost Ancient Earth from which everything had begun, long ago and\nfar away, ever so long ago.",
      "He is not like Grindelwald. There is nothing human\nleft in him. Him you must destroy. Save your fury for that, and\nthat alone -",
      "Harry shook his head slightly, tilting the stars a little in his\nvision, as he lay on the stone floor looking upward and outward and\nforward in time. Even if Dumbledore was right, and the true enemy\nwas utterly mad and evil... in a hundred million years the organic\nlifeform known as Lord Voldemort probably wouldn't seem much\ndifferent from all the other bewildered children of Ancient Earth.\nWhatever Lord Voldemort had done to himself, whatever Dark rituals\nseemed so horribly irrevocable on a merely human scale, it wouldn't\nbe beyond curing with the technology of a hundred million years.\nKilling him, even if you had to do it to save the lives of\nothers, would be just one more death for future sentient beings to\nbe sad about. How could you look up at the stars, and believe\nanything else?",
      "Harry stared up at the twinkling lights of Eternity and wondered\nwhat the children's children's children would think of what\nDumbledore had maybe-done to Narcissa.",
      "But even if you tried framing the question that way, asking what\nhumanity's descendants would think, it still drew only on your own\nknowledge, not theirs. The answer still came from inside yourself,\nand it could still be mistaken. If you didn't know the hundredth\ndecimal digit of pi yourself, then you didn't know how the\nchildren's children's children would calculate it, for all that the\nfact was trivial.",
      "Slowly - he'd been lying there, looking at the stars, for longer\nthan he'd planned - Harry sat up from the ground. Pushing himself\nto his feet, the muscles protesting, he walked over to the edge of\nthe stone platform at the height of the Ravenclaw tower. The stone\ncrenellations surrounding the edge of the tower weren't high, not\nhigh enough to be safe. They were markers, clearly, rather than\nrailings. Harry didn't approach too close to the edge; there was no\npoint in taking chances. Looking down at the Hogwarts grounds\nbelow, he was predictably feeling a sense of dizziness, the wobbly\naffliction called vertigo. His brain was alarmed, it seemed,\nbecause the ground below was so distant. It might have\nbeen fully 50 meters away.",
      "The lesson, it seemed, was that things had to be\nincredibly close by before your brain could comprehend\nthem well enough to feel fear.",
      "It was a rare brain that could feel strongly about anything, if\nit wasn't close in space, close in time, near at hand, within easy\nreach...",
      "Before, Harry had imagined that going to Azkaban would require\nplanning and cooperation from a grownup confederate. Portkeys,\nbroomsticks, invisibility spells. Some way of getting to the bottom\nlevels without the Aurors noticing, so he could carve his way into\nthe central pit where the shadows of Death waited.",
      "And that had been enough to put the prospect away, into the\nfuture, safely apart from the now.",
      "He hadn't realized until today that it might be as simple as\nfinding Fawkes and telling the phoenix that it was time.",
      "Memories were rising up again, memories that Harry could never\nmanage to forget for long. Though the stones beneath his feet were\nnot smooth like metal, though the moonlit sky stretched all around\nhim, somehow it was very easy to imagine himself trapped in a long\nmetal corridor lit by dim orange light.",
      "The night was quiet, quiet enough for memories to be clearly\naudible.",
      "No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!",
      "No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!",
      "Don't take it away, don't don't don't -",
      "The world blurred, and Harry wiped his eyes with his sleeve.",
      "If Hermione had been the one behind that door -",
      "If Hermione had been put in Azkaban, Harry would have called the\nphoenix and gone there and burned away every last Dementor and it\nwouldn't have made a single difference how crazy it was or what\nelse he'd wanted to do with his life. That was just - that was -\nthat was just how it was.",
      "And the woman who was behind that door - wasn't there\nsomeone, somewhere, to whom she too was precious? Wasn't it only\nHarry's distance from her life that was preventing his brain from\nbeing driven to Azkaban to save her no matter what? What\nwould it have taken to compel him? Would he have needed to know her\nface? Her name? Her favorite color? Would he have been driven to\nAzkaban to save Tracey Davis? Would he have been compelled there to\nsave Professor McGonagall? Mum and Dad - there wasn't even any\nquestion. And that woman had said she was someone's mother. How\nmany people had wished for the power to break Azkaban? How many\nprisoners of Azkaban dreamed nightly of such a miraculous\nrescue?",
      "None. It's a happy thought.",
      "Maybe he should harrow Azkaban. All he had to do was\nfind Fawkes and tell him it was time. Visualize the center of the\nDementor's pit as he'd seen it from the broomstick, and let the\nphoenix take him there. Cast the True Patronus Charm at point-blank\nrange and to hell with what came after.",
      "All he had to do was go find Fawkes.",
      "It might be as simple as thinking of the flame, calling for the\nfire-bird in his heart -",
      "A star flashed in the night.",
      "By the time Harry's eyes had jumped with a reflex action trained\non meteor showers, another part of him was surprised that the\nastronomical phenomenon was still there; a faint star whose\nbrightness was slowly visibly waxing. There was a startled moment\nwhen Harry wondered whether he was seeing, not a meteor, but a nova\nor supernova - could you see them getting brighter like\nthat? Was the first stage of a nova supposed to be that\nyellow-orange color?",
      "Then the new star moved again, and seemed to grow as well as\nbrightening. It looked closer suddenly, no longer so far\naway that distance became moot. Like what you thought was a star,\nturning out to be an airplane, a lighted form whose shape you could\nactually see...",
      "...no, not a plane...",
      "The realization seemed to spread out from Harry's chest in a\nwave of prickling, sweat preparing to break out.",
      "...a bird.",
      "A piercing cry split the night, echoing from the rooftops of\nHogwarts.",
      "The approaching creature trailed fire as it flew, shedding\ngolden flames like sparks from its feathers as the mighty wings\nbeat and beat again. Even as it swooped up in a great curve to\nhover a few paces away from Harry, even as the flames surrounding\nits passage diminished, the creature seemed no dimmer, no less\nbright; as though some unseen Sun shone upon it and illuminated\nit.",
      "Great shining wings red like a sunset, and eyes like\nincandescent pearls, blazing with golden fire and\ndetermination.",
      "The phoenix's beak opened, and let out a great caw that Harry\nunderstood as though it had been a spoken word:",
      "COME!",
      "Not even realizing, the boy stumbled back from the edge of the\nrooftop, eyes still locked on the phoenix, his whole body trembling\nand tensed, his fists clutching and releasing at his side; stepping\nback, stepping away.",
      "The phoenix cawed again, a desperate, pleading, sound. It didn't\ncome through in words, this time, but it came through in feelings,\nan echo of everything that Harry had ever felt about Azkaban and\nevery temptation to action, to just do something\nabout it, the desperate need to do something now and not\ndelay any longer, all spoken in the cry of a bird.",
      "Let's go. It's time. The voice that spoke came from\ninside Harry, not from the phoenix; from so deep inside it couldn't\nbe given a separate name like 'Gryffindor'.",
      "All he had to do was step forward and touch the phoenix's\ntalons, and it would take him where he needed to be, where he kept\nthinking he ought to be, down into the central pit of Azkaban.\nHarry could see the image in his mind, shining with unbearable\nclarity, the image of himself suddenly smiling with joyous release\nas he threw all his fears away and chose -",
      "\"But I -\" Harry whispered, not even aware of what he was saying.\nHarry lifted his shaking hands to wipe at his eyes from which tears\nhad sprung, as the phoenix hovered before him with great\nwing-sweeps. \"But I - there's other people I also have to save,\nother things I have to do -\"",
      "The fire-bird let out a piercing scream, and the boy flinched\nback as though from a blow. It wasn't a command, it wasn't an\nobjection, it was the knowledge -",
      "The corridors lit by dim orange light.",
      "It felt like a tightening compulsion in Harry's chest, the\ndesire to just do it and get it over with. He might die,\nbut if he didn't die he could feel clean again. Have\nprinciples that were more than excuses for inaction. It was\nhis life. His to spend, if he chose. He could do it any\ntime he wanted...",
      "...if he wasn't a good person.",
      "The boy stood there on the rooftop, his own eyes locked with two\npoints of fire. The stars might have had time to shift in their\nconstellations while he stood there, agonizing over the\ndecision...",
      "...that wouldn't...",
      "...change.",
      "The boy's eyes flickered once to the stars above; and then he\nlooked at the phoenix.",
      "\"Not yet,\" the boy said in a voice hardly audible. \"Not yet.\nThere's too much else I have to do. Please come back later, when\nI've found others who can cast the True Patronus - in six months,\nmaybe -\"",
      "Without word, without sound, a sphere of fire surrounded the\nbird's form, crackling and blazing with white and crimson veins as\nthough it meant to consume that which lay within; and when the fire\ndispersed into grey smoke, no phoenix remained.",
      "There was silence on the top of the Ravenclaw tower. The boy\ngradually lowered his hands from his ears, pausing only to wipe at\nhis wet cheeks.",
      "Slowly, the boy turned -",
      "Then cried out and leapt back and almost fell off the Ravenclaw\ntower; though the misstep would hardly have mattered, with that\nother wizard standing there.",
      "\"And so it was done,\" Albus Dumbledore said, almost in a\nwhisper. \"So it was done.\" Fawkes was on his shoulder, staring at\nwhere the other phoenix had been with an indecipherable avian\ngaze.",
      "\"What are you doing here?\u202f\"",
      "\"Ah?\" said the ancient man standing on the roof-platform's\nopposite corner. \"I felt the presence of a creature Hogwarts did\nnot know, and came to see, of course.\" Slowly the old wizard's\nshaking hand came up to remove the half-moon glasses, his other\nhand wiped at his eyes and forehead with his robe's sleeve. \"I\ndared - I dared not speak - I knew, I knew this choice above all\nchoices must be your own -\"",
      "A strange apprehension was beginning to fill Harry, welling up\nin him like a sick feeling in his stomach.",
      "\"That everything depended on this,\" Albus Dumbledore said, still\nin that almost-whisper, \"that much I knew. But which choice led\ninto darkness, that I could not guess. At least the choice was your\nown.\"",
      "\"I don't -\" Harry said, and then his voice stopped.",
      "A terrible hypothesis, rising in credibility...",
      "\"The phoenix comes,\" said the old wizard. \"To those who would\nfight, to those would act even at cost of their lives, the phoenix\ncomes. Phoenixes are not wise, Harry, they know no means to judge\nus, save witnessing the choice. I thought it was to my death I\nwent, when the phoenix took me to fight Grindelwald. I did not know\nthat Fawkes would sustain me, and heal me, and stay by my side -\"\nThe old wizard's voice quavered, for a moment. \"It is not spoken of\n- you should realize, Harry, why it is never spoken of - if the one\nknew, the phoenix could not judge. But to you, Harry, I may say it\nnow, for the phoenix comes only once.\"",
      "The old wizard walked across the top of the Ravenclaw tower to\nwhere a boy stood rooted in dawning horror, in dawning and utter\nhorror.",
      "In my duel with Grindelwald I could not win, only fight him\nfor long hours until he collapsed in exhaustion; and I would have\ndied of it afterward, if not for Fawkes -",
      "Harry didn't even know he was speaking, until the whisper had\nescaped him -",
      "\"Then I could have -\"",
      "\"Could you have?\" said the ancient wizard, his voice sounding\nfar older than his normal tones. \"Three times, now, a phoenix has\ncome for my student. One did send hers away, and the grief of it\nbroke her, I think. And the last was cousin to your young friend\nLavender Brown, and he -\" The old wizard's voice cracked. \"He did\nnot return, did poor John, and he saved none of those he meant to\nsave. It is said, among the few scholars of phoenix-lore, that not\none in four returns from their ordeal. And even if you did survive\n- for the life you must lead, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres - the\nchoices you must make and the path you must walk - to always hear\nthe phoenix's cries - who is to say it would not have driven you\nmad?\" The old wizard raised his sleeve again, drawing it once more\nacross his face. \"I had more joy of Fawkes's companionship, in the\ndays before I fought Voldemort.\"",
      "The boy did not seem to be listening, all his eyes were on the\nred-gold bird on the ancient wizard's shoulder. \"Fawkes?\" the boy\nsaid in shaking voice. \"Why won't you look at me, Fawkes?\"",
      "Fawkes craned his head to peer at the boy curiously, then turned\nback and resumed gazing at his master.",
      "\"See?\" said the old wizard. \"He does not reject you. Fawkes may\nnot be interested in you in quite that way, now; and he knows -\"\nthe wizard smiled wryly, \"- that you are not exactly loyal to his\nmaster. But one to whom the phoenix comes at all - cannot be one\nwhom a phoenix would dislike.\" The wizard's voice fell to a whisper\nagain. \"There never was a bird seen on Godric Gryffindor's\nshoulder. Though it is not written even in his secrets, I think he\nmust have sent his phoenix away, before he chose the red and gold\nfor his colors. Perhaps the guilt of it urged him to greater\nlengths than he ever would have dared otherwise. Or it might have\ntaught him humility, and respect for human frailty, and failure...\"\nThe wizard bowed his head. \"I truly do not know if your choice was\nwise. I truly do not know if it was the right thing, or the wrong\nthing. If I knew, Harry, I would have spoken. But I -\" Dumbledore's\nvoice broke, then. \"I am nothing but a foolish young boy who has\nbecome a foolish old man, and I have no wisdom.\"",
      "Harry couldn't breathe, the nausea seeming to fill and overflow\nhis whole body, stomach locked solid. He was suddenly and terribly\ncertain that he had failed, in some final sense failed, failed this\nvery night -",
      "The boy whirled and ran out to the curb of the Ravenclaw\nrooftop. \"Come back!\" His voice cracked, rising to a shriek.\n\"Come back!\u202f\"",
      "Final Aftermath:",
      "She came awake with a gasp of horror, she woke with an unvoiced\nscream on her lips and no words came forth, she could not\nunderstand what she had seen, she could not understand what she\nhad seen -",
      "\"What time is it?\" she whispered.",
      "Her golden jeweled alarm clock whispered back, \"Around eleven at\nnight. Go back to sleep.\"",
      "Her sheets were soaked in sweat, her nightclothes soaked in\nsweat, she took her wand from beside the pillow and cleaned herself\nup before she tried to go back to sleep and eventually\nsucceeded.",
      "Sybill Trelawney went back to sleep.",
      "In the Forbidden Forest, a centaur woken by a nameless\napprehension ceased scanning the night sky, having found only\nquestions there and no answers; and with a folding of his many\nlegs, Firenze went back to sleep.",
      "In the distant lands of magical Asia, an ancient witch named Fan\nTong, sleeping the tired days away, told her anxious\ngreat-great-grandson that she was fine, it had only been a\nnightmare, and went back to sleep.",
      "In a land where Muggleborns received no letters of any kind, a\ngirl-child too young to have a name of her own was rocked in the\narms of her annoyed but loving mother until she stopped crying and\nwent back to sleep.",
      "None of them slept well."

      "The four of them gathered once more around the ancient desk of\nthe Headmaster of Hogwarts, with its drawers within drawers within\ndrawers, wherein all the past paperwork of the Hogwarts School was\nstored; legend had it that Headmistress Shehla had once gotten lost\nin that desk, and was, in fact, still there, and wouldn't be let\nout again until she got her files organized. Minerva didn't\nparticularly look forward to inheriting those drawers, when she\ninherited that desk someday - if any of them survived.",
      "Albus Dumbledore was seated behind his desk, looking grave and\ncomposed.",
      "Severus Snape was standing next to the dead Floo and its ashes,\nhovering ominously like the vampire that students sometimes accused\nhim of pretending to be.",
      "Mad-Eye Moody had been meant to join them, but was yet to\narrive.",
      "And Harry...",
      "A boy's small, thin frame, perched on the arm of his chair, as\nthough the energies running through him were too great to allow\nordinary seating. Set face, sweaty hair, intent green eyes, and\nwithin it all, the jagged lightning-bolt of his never-healing scar.\nHe seemed grimmer, now; even compared to a single week earlier.",
      "For a moment Minerva flashed back to her trip to Diagon Alley\nwith Harry, what seemed like ages and ages ago. There'd been this\nsomber boy inside that Harry, somehow, even then. This\nwasn't entirely her own fault, or Albus's fault. And yet there was\nsomething almost unbearably sad about the contrast between the\nyoung boy she'd first met, and what magical Britain had made of\nhim. Harry had never had much of an ordinary childhood, she'd\ngathered; Harry's adoptive parents had said to her that he'd spoken\nlittle and played less with Muggle children. It was painful to\nthink that Harry might have had only a few months of playing beside\nthe other children in Hogwarts, before the war's demands had\nstripped it all away. Maybe there was another face that Harry\nshowed to the children his own age, when he wasn't staring down the\nWizengamot. But she couldn't stop herself from imagining Harry\nPotter's childhood as a heap of firewood, and herself and Albus\nfeeding the wooden branches, piece by piece, into the flames.",
      "\"Prophecies are strange things,\" said Albus Dumbledore. The old\nwizard's eyes were half-lidded, as though in weariness. \"Vague,\nunclear, meaning escaping like water held between loose fingers.\nProphecy is ever a burden, for there are no answers there, only\nquestions.\"",
      "Harry Potter was sitting tensely. \"Headmaster Dumbledore,\" said\nthe boy with soft precision, \"my friends are being targeted.\nHermione Granger almost went to Azkaban. The war has begun, as you\nput it. Professor Trelawney's prophecy is key information for\nweighing up the balance of my hypotheses about what's going on. Not\nto mention how silly it is - and dangerous - that the Dark\nLord knows the prophecy and I don't.\"",
      "Albus looked a grim question at her, and she shook her head in\nreply; in whatever unimaginable way Harry had discovered that\nTrelawney had made the prophecy and that the Dark Lord knew of it,\nhe hadn't learned that much from her.",
      "\"Voldemort, seeking to avert that very prophecy, went to his\ndefeat at your hands,\" the old wizard said then. \"His knowledge\nbrought him only harm. Ponder that carefully, Harry Potter.\"",
      "\"Yes, Headmaster, I do understand that. My home culture also has\na literary tradition of self-fulfilling and misinterpreted\nprophecies. I'll interpret with caution, rest assured. But I've\nalready guessed quite a bit. Is it safer for me to work from\npartial guesses?\"",
      "Time passed.",
      "\"Minerva,\" said Albus. \"If you would.\"",
      "\"The one...\" she began. The words came falteringly to her\nthroat; she was no actress. She couldn't imitate the deep, chilling\ntone of the original prophecy; and yet somehow that tone seemed to\ncarry all the meaning. \"The one with the power to vanquish\nthe Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied\nhim, born as the seventh month dies...\"",
      "\"And the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal,\" came\nSeverus's voice, making her jump within her chair. The Potions\nMaster loomed tall by the fireplace. \"But he shall have power\nthe Dark Lord knows not... and either must destroy all but a\nremnant of the other, for those two different spirits cannot exist\nin the same world.\"",
      "That last line Severus spoke with so much foreboding that it\nchilled her bones; it was almost like listening to Sybill\nTrelawney.",
      "Harry was listening with a frown. \"Can you repeat that?\" said\nHarry.",
      "\"The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord\napproaches, born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the\nseventh month -\"",
      "\"Actually, hold on, can you write that down? I need to analyze\nthis carefully -\"",
      "This was done, with both Albus and Severus watching the\nparchment hawklike, as though to make sure that no unseen hand\nreached in and snatched the precious information away.",
      "\"Let's see...\" Harry said. \"I'm male and born on July 31st,\ncheck. I did in fact vanquish the Dark Lord, check. Ambiguous\npronoun in line two... but I wasn't born yet so it's hard to see\nhow my parents could have thrice defied me. This scar is\nan obvious candidate for the mark...\" Harry touched his forehead.\n\"Then there's the power the Dark Lord knows not, which probably\nrefers to my scientific background -\"",
      "\"No,\" said Severus.",
      "Harry looked at the Potions Master in surprise.",
      "Severus's eyes were closed, his face tightened in concentration.\n\"The Dark Lord could obtain that power by studying the same books\nas you, Potter. But the prophecy did not say, power the Dark\nLord has not. Nor even, power the Dark Lord cannot\nhave. She spoke of power the Dark Lord knows not...\nit will be something stranger to him than Muggle artifacts.\nSomething perhaps that he cannot comprehend at all, even having\nseen it...\"",
      "\"Science is not a bag of technological tricks,\" Harry said.\n\"It's not just the Muggle version of a wand. It's not even\nknowledge like memorizing the periodic table. It's a different way\nof thinking.\"",
      "\"Perhaps...\" the Potions Master murmured, but his voice was\nskeptical.",
      "\"It is hazardous,\" Albus said, \"to read too far into a prophecy,\neven if you have heard it yourself. They are things of exceeding\nfrustration.\"",
      "\"So I see,\" Harry said. His hand rose up, rubbed the scar on his\nforehead. \"But... okay, if this is really all we know...\nlook, I'll just put it bluntly. How do you know that the\nDark Lord actually survived?\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" she cried. Albus just sighed and leaned back\nin the vast Headmaster's chair.",
      "\"Well,\" Harry said, \"imagine how this prophecy sounded back when\nit was made. You-Know-Who learns the prophecy, and it sounds like\nI'm destined to grow up and overthrow him. That the two of us are\nmeant to have a final battle where either of us must destroy all\nbut a remnant of the other. So You-Know-Who attacks Godric's Hollow\nand immediately gets vanquished, leaving behind\nsome remnant which may or may not be his disembodied soul.\nMaybe the Death Eaters are his remnant, or the Dark Mark. This\nprophecy could already be fulfilled, is what I'm saying. Don't get\nme wrong - I do realize that my interpretation sounds stretched.\nTrelawney's phrasing doesn't seem natural for describing\nonly the events that historically happened on October\n31st, 1981. Attacking a baby and having the spell bounce off, isn't\nsomething you'd normally call 'the power to vanquish'. But if you\nthink of the prophecy as being about several possible\nfutures, only one of which was actually realized on\nHalloween, then the prophecy could already be complete.\"",
      "\"But -\" Minerva blurted. \"But the raid on Azkaban -\"",
      "\"If the Dark Lord survived, then sure, he's the most\nlikely suspect for the Azkaban breakout,\" Harry said reasonably.\n\"You could even say that the Azkaban breakout is Bayesian evidence\nfor the Dark Lord surviving, because an Azkaban breakout is more\nlikely to happen in worlds where he's alive than worlds where he's\ndead. But it's not strong Bayesian evidence. It's not\nsomething that can't possibly happen unless the Dark Lord\nis alive. Professor Quirrell, who didn't start from the\nassumption that You-Know-Who was still around, had no trouble\nthinking of his own explanation. To him, it was obvious that some\npowerful wizard might want Bellatrix Black because she knew a\nsecret of the Dark Lord's, like some of his magical knowledge that\nhe'd told to only her. The priors against anyone surviving their\nbody's death are very low, even if it's magically possible.\nMost times it doesn't happen. So if it's just the\nAzkaban breakout... I'd have to say formally that it isn't enough\nBayesian evidence. The improbability of the evidence assuming that\nthe hypothesis is false, is not commensurate with the prior\nimprobability of the hypothesis.\"",
      "\"No,\" Severus said flatly. \"The prophecy is not yet fulfilled. I\nwould know if it were.\"",
      "\"Are you sure of that?\"",
      "\"Yes, Potter. If the prophecy had already come true, I would\nunderstand it! I heard Trelawney's words, I remember\nTrelawney's voice, and if I knew the events that matched the\nprophecy, I would recognize them. What has already\nhappened... does not fit.\" The Potions Master spoke with\ncertainty.",
      "\"I'm not really sure what to do with that statement,\" Harry\nsaid. His hand rose up, absently rubbed at his forehead. \"Maybe\nit's just what you think happened that doesn't fit, and\nthe true history is different...\"",
      "\"Voldemort is alive,\" Albus said. \"There are other\nindications.\"",
      "\"Such as?\" Harry's reply was instant.",
      "Albus paused. \"There are terrible rituals by which wizards have\nreturned from death,\" Albus said slowly. \"That much, anyone can\ndiscern within history and legend. And yet those books are missing,\nI could not find them; it was Voldemort who removed them, I am sure\n-\"",
      "\"So you can't find any books on immortality, and that\nproves that You-Know-Who has them?\"",
      "\"Indeed,\" said Albus. \"There is a certain book - I will not name\nit aloud - missing from the Restricted Section of the Hogwarts\nlibrary. An ancient scroll which should have been at Borgin and\nBurkes, with only an empty place on a shelf to show where it was -\"\nThe old wizard stopped. \"But I suppose,\" the old wizard said, as\nthough to himself, \"you will say that even if Voldemort tried to\nmake himself immortal, it does not prove that he succeeded...\"",
      "Harry sighed. \"Proof, Headmaster? There are only ever\nprobabilities. If there are known, particular books on immortality\nrituals which are missing, that increases the probability that\nsomeone attempted one. Which, in turn, raises the prior probability\nof the Dark Lord surviving his death. This I concede, and thank you\nfor contributing the fact. The question is whether the prior\nprobability goes up enough.\"",
      "\"Surely,\" Albus said quietly, \"if you concede even a\nchance that Voldemort survived, that is worth guarding\nagainst?\"",
      "Harry inclined his head. \"As you say, Headmaster. Though once a\nprobability drops low enough, it's also an error to go on obsessing\nabout it... Given that books on immortality are missing, and that\nthis prophecy would sound somewhat more natural if it\nrefers to the Dark Lord and I having a future battle, I agree that\nthe Dark Lord being alive is a probability, not just possibility.\nBut other probabilities must also be taken into account -\nand in the probable worlds where You-Know-Who is not\nalive, someone else framed Hermione.\"",
      "\"Foolishness,\" Severus said softly. \"Utter foolishness. The Dark\nMark has not faded, nor has its master.\"",
      "\"See, that's what I mean by formally insufficient\nBayesian evidence. Sure, it sounds all grim and foreboding and\nstuff, but is it that unlikely for a magical mark to stay\naround after the maker dies? Suppose the mark is certain to\ncontinue while the Dark Lord's sentience lives on, but a\npriori we'd only have guessed a twenty percent chance of the\nDark Mark continuing to exist after the Dark Lord dies. Then the\nobservation, 'The Dark Mark has not faded' is five times as likely\nto occur in worlds where the Dark Lord is alive as in worlds where\nthe Dark Lord is dead. Is that really commensurate with the prior\nimprobability of immortality? Let's say the prior odds were a\nhundred-to-one against the Dark Lord surviving. If a hypothesis is\na hundred times as likely to be false versus true, and then you see\nevidence five times more likely if the hypothesis is true versus\nfalse, you should update to believing the hypothesis is twenty\ntimes as likely to be false as true. Odds of a hundred to one,\ntimes a likelihood ratio of one to five, equals odds of twenty to\none that the Dark Lord is dead -\"",
      "\"Where are you getting all these numbers, Potter?\"",
      "\"That is the admitted weakness of the method,\" Harry\nsaid readily. \"But what I'm qualitatively getting at is\nwhy the observation, 'The Dark Mark has not faded', is not adequate\nsupport for the hypothesis, 'The Dark Lord is immortal.' The\nevidence isn't as extraordinary as the claim.\" Harry paused. \"Not\nto mention that even if the Dark Lord is alive, he doesn't\nhave to be the one who framed Hermione. As a cunning man\nonce said, there could be more than one plotter and more than one\nplan.\"",
      "\"Such as the Defense Professor,\" Severus said with a thin smile.\n\"I suppose I must agree that he is a suspect. It was the Defense\nProfessor last year, after all; and the year before that, and the\nyear before that.\"",
      "Harry's eyes dropped back to the parchment in his lap. \"Let's\nmove on. Are we certain that this Prophecy is accurate?\nNobody messed with Professor McGonagall's memory, maybe edited or\nsubtracted a line?\"",
      "Albus paused, then spoke slowly. \"There is a great spell laid\nover Britain, recording every prophecy said within our borders. Far\nbeneath the Most Ancient Hall of the Wizengamot, in the Department\nof Mysteries, they are recorded.\"",
      "\"The Hall of Prophecy,\" Minerva whispered. She'd read about that\nplace, said to be a great room of shelves filled with glowing orbs,\none after another appearing over the years. Merlin himself had\nwrought it, it was said; the greatest wizard's final slap to the\nface of Fate. Not all prophecies conduced to the good; and Merlin\nhad wished for at least those spoken of in prophecy, to know what\nhad been spoken of them. That was the respect Merlin had\ngiven to their free will, that Destiny might not control them from\nthe outside, unwitting. Those mentioned within a prophecy would\nhave an glowing orb float to their hand, and then hear the\nprophet's true voice speaking. Others who tried to touch an orb, it\nwas said, would be driven mad - or possibly just have their heads\nexplode, the legends were unclear on this point. Whatever Merlin's\noriginal intention, the Unspeakables hadn't let anyone enter in\ncenturies, so far as she'd heard. Works of the Ancient\nWizards had stated that later Unspeakables had discovered that\ntipping off the subjects of prophecies could interfere with seers\nreleasing whatever temporal pressures they released; and so the\nheirs of Merlin had sealed his Hall. It did occur to Minerva to\nwonder (now that she'd spent a few months around Mr. Potter) how\nanyone could possibly know that; but she also knew better\nthan to ask Albus, in case Albus tried to tell her. Minerva firmly\nbelieved that you only ought to worry about Time if you were a\nclock.",
      "\"The Hall of Prophecy,\" Albus confirmed lowly. \"Those who are\nspoken of in a prophecy, may listen to that prophecy there. Do you\nsee the implication, Harry?\"",
      "Harry frowned. \"Well, I could listen to it, or the Dark Lord...\noh, my parents. Those who had thrice defied him. They were\nalso mentioned in the prophecy, so they could hear the\nrecording?\"",
      "\"If James and Lily heard anything different from what Minerva\nreported,\" Albus said evenly, \"they did not say so to me.\"",
      "\"You took James and Lily there?\u202f\" Minerva said.",
      "\"Fawkes can go to many places,\" Albus said. \"Do not mention the\nfact.\"",
      "Harry was staring directly at Albus. \"Can I go to this\nDepartment of Mysteries place and hear the recorded prophecy? The\noriginal tone of voice might be helpful, from what I've heard.\"",
      "Light glinted from the reflection of Albus's half-moon glasses\nas the old wizard slowly shook his head. \"I think that would be\nunwise,\" Albus said. \"For reasons beyond the obvious. It is\ndangerous, that place which Merlin made; more dangerous to some\npeople than others.\"",
      "\"I see,\" Harry said tonelessly, and looked back down at the\nparchment. \"I'll take the prophecy as assumed accurate for now. The\nnext part says that the Dark Lord has marked me as his equal. Any\nideas on what that means exactly?\"",
      "\"Surely not,\" said Albus, \"that you must imitate his ways, in\nany wise.\"",
      "\"I'm not dumb, Headmaster. Muggles have worked out a\nthing or two about temporal paradoxes, even if it's all theoretical\nto them. I won't throw away my ethics just because a signal from\nthe future claims it's going to happen, because then that becomes\nthe only reason why it happened in the first place. Still, what\ndoes it mean?\"",
      "\"I do not know,\" said Severus.",
      "\"Nor I,\" she said.",
      "Harry took out his wand, turned it over in his hands, gazing\nmeditatively at the wood. \"Eleven inches, holly, with a core of\nphoenix feather,\" Harry said. \"And the phoenix whose tail feather\nis in this wand, only ever gave one other, which Mr... what was his\nname, Olive-something... made into the core of the Dark Lord's\nwand. And I'm a Parselmouth. It seemed like a lot of\ncoincidence even then. And now I find out there's a prophecy\nstating that I'll be the Dark Lord's equal.\"",
      "Severus's eyes were thoughtful; the Headmaster's gaze,\nunreadable.",
      "\"Could it be,\" Minerva said falteringly, \"that You-Know-Who -\nthat Voldemort - transferred some of his own powers to Mr. Potter,\nthe night he gave him that scar? Not something he intended to do,\nsurely. Still... I don't see how Mr. Potter could be his\nequal, if he had any less magic than the Dark Lord\nhimself...\"",
      "\"Meh,\" said Harry, still looking meditatively at his wand. \"I'd\nfight the Dark Lord without any magic at all, if I had to. Homo\nsapiens didn't become the dominant species on this planet by\nhaving the sharpest claws or hardest armor - though I suppose some\nof that point may be lost on wizards. Still, it's beneath my\ndignity as a human being to be scared of anything that isn't\nsmarter than I am; and from what I've heard, on that particular\ndimension the Dark Lord wasn't very scary.\"",
      "The Potions Master spoke, his voice taking on some of his\ncustomary contemptuous drawl. \"You imagine yourself more\nintelligent than the Dark Lord, Potter?\"",
      "\"Yes, in fact,\" said Harry, pulling back the left sleeve of his\nrobes, and rolling up the shirtsleeve beneath to expose the bare\nelbow. \"Oh, that reminds me! Let's make sure nobody here has the\nclearly visible tattoo in the standard, easily checkable location\nwhich would mark them as a secret enemy spy.\"",
      "Albus made a quieting gesture that halted the Potions Master\nbefore he could say anything scathing. \"Tell me, Harry,\" Albus\nsaid, \"how would you have crafted the Dark Mark?\"",
      "\"Nonstandard locations,\" Harry said promptly, \"not easily found\nwithout embarrassment and fuss, though of course any\nsecurity-conscious person would check anyway. Make it smaller, if\npossible. Overlay another non-magical tattoo to obscure the exact\nshape - better yet, cover it with a layer of fake skin -\"",
      "\"Cunning indeed,\" Albus said. \"But tell me, suppose you could\ncraft any conditions you wished into the Mark, fading it or raising\nit as you wished. What would you do then?\"",
      "\"Make it completely invisible at all times,\" Harry said in tones\nof stating the obvious. \"You don't want there to be any detectable\ndifference between a spy and a non-spy.\"",
      "\"Suppose you are more cunning still,\" Albus said. \"You are a\nmaster of trickery, a master of deception, and you employ your\nabilities to the fullest.\"",
      "\"Well -\" The boy stopped, frowning. \"It seems unnecessarily\ncomplicated, more like a tactic a villain would use in a\nrole-playing game than something you'd try in a real-life war. But\nI suppose you could put fake Dark Marks on people who aren't really\nDeath Eaters, and keep the Dark Marks on the real Death Eaters\ninvisible. But then there's the question of why people would start\nbelieving in the first place that the Dark Mark identified a Death\nEater... I'd have to think about it for at least five minutes, if I\nwere going to take the problem seriously.\"",
      "\"I ask you this,\" Albus said, still in that mild tone, \"because\nI did indeed, in the early days of the war, perform such tests as\nyou suggested. The Order survived my folly only because Alastor did\nnot trust in the bare arms we saw. I had thought, afterward, that\nthe bearers of the Mark might hide it or show it at their will. And\nyet when we hied Igor Karkaroff before the Wizengamot, that Mark\nshowed clear on his arm, for all that Karkaroff wished to protest\nhis innocence. What true rule may govern the Dark Mark, I do not\nknow. Even Severus is still bound by his Mark not to reveal its\nsecrets to any who do not know them.\"",
      "\"Oh, well that makes it obvious,\" Harry said\npromptly. \"Wait, hold on - you were a Death Eater?\u202f\" Harry\ntransferred his stare to Severus.",
      "Severus returned a thin smile. \"I still am, so far as they\nknow.\"",
      "\"Harry,\" said Albus, eyes only for the boy. \"What do you mean,\nthat makes it obvious?\"",
      "\"Information theory 101,\" the boy said in a lecturing tone.\n\"Observing variable X conveys information about variable Y, if and\nonly if the possible values of X have different probabilities given\ndifferent states of Y. The instant you hear about anything\nwhatsoever that varies between a spy and a nonspy, you should\nimmediately think of exploiting it to distinguish spies from\nnonspies. Similarly, to distinguish reality from lies, you need a\nprocess which behaves differently in the presence of truth and\nfalsehood - that's why 'faith' doesn't work as a discriminant,\nwhile 'make experimental predictions and test them' does. You say\nsomeone with the Dark Mark can't reveal its secrets to anyone who\ndoesn't already know them. So to find out how the Dark Mark\noperates, write down every way you can imagine the Dark Mark\nmight work, then watch Professor Snape try to tell each of\nthose things to a confederate - maybe one who doesn't know what the\nexperiment is about - I'll explain binary search later so that you\ncan play Twenty Questions to narrow things down - and whatever he\ncan't say out loud is true. His silence would be something\nthat behaves differently in the presence of true statements about\nthe Mark, versus false statements, you see.\"",
      "Minerva's mouth was hanging open, she realized; and she closed\nit abruptly. Even Albus looked surprised.",
      "\"And after that, like I said, any behavioral difference\nbetween spies and nonspies can be used to identify spies. Once\nyou've identified at least one magically censored secret of the\nDark Mark, you can test someone for the Dark Mark by seeing if they\ncan reveal that secret to somebody who doesn't already know it\n-\"",
      "\"Thank you, Mr. Potter.\"",
      "Everyone looked at Severus. The Potions Master was\nstraightening, his teeth bared in a grimace of angry triumph.\n\"Headmaster, I can now speak freely of the Mark. If we know we are\ncaught for a Death Eater, before others who have not yet seen our\nbare arms, our Mark reveals itself whether we will it or no. But if\nthey have already seen our arms bare, it does not reveal itself;\nnor if we are only being tested from suspicion. Thus the Dark Mark\nseems to identify Death Eaters - but only those already found, you\nperceive.\"",
      "\"Ah...\" Albus said. \"Thank you, Severus.\" He closed his eyes\nbriefly. \"That would indeed explain why Black escaped even Peter's\nnotice... ah, well. And Harry's proposed test?\"",
      "The Potions Master shook his head. \"The Dark Lord was no fool,\ndespite Potter's delusions. The moment such a test is suspected,\nthe Mark ceases to bind our tongues. Yet I could not hint at the\npossibility, but only wait for another to deduce it.\" Another thin\nsmile. \"I would award you a good many House points, Mr. Potter, if\nit would not compromise my cover. But as you can see, the Dark Lord\nwas quite cunning.\" His gaze grew more distant. \"Oh,\" Severus\nbreathed, \"he was very cunning indeed...\"",
      "Harry Potter sat still for a long moment.",
      "Then -",
      "\"No,\" Harry said. The boy shook his head. \"No, that can't\nactually be true. First of all, we're talking about the\nkind of logic puzzle that would appear in chapter one of a\nRaymond Smullyan book, nowhere near the level of what\nMuggle scientists do for a living. And second, for all I know, it\ntook the Dark Lord five months of thinking to invent the puzzle I\njust solved in five seconds -\"",
      "\"Is it that inconceivable to you, Potter, that anyone\ncould be so intelligent as yourself?\" The Potions Master's voice\nheld more curiosity than scorn.",
      "\"It's called a base rate, Professor Snape. The evidence is\nequally compatible with the Dark Lord inventing that puzzle over\nthe course of five months or over the course of five seconds, but\nin any given population there'll be many more people who can do it\nin five months than in five seconds...\" Harry pasted a hand against\nhis forehead. \"Darn it, how can I explain this? I suppose, from\nyour perspective, the Dark Lord came up with a clever puzzle and I\ncleverly solved it and that makes us look equal.\"",
      "\"I remember your first day of Potions class,\" the Potions Master\nsaid dryly. \"I think you have a ways still to go.\"",
      "\"Peace, Severus,\" Albus said. \"Harry has already accomplished\nmore than you know. Yet tell me, Harry - why do you\nbelieve the Dark Lord is less than you? Surely he is a damaged soul\nin many ways. But cunning for cunning - you are not yet ready to\nface him, I would judge; and I know the full tally of your\ndeeds.\"",
      "The frustrating thing about this conversation was that Harry\ncouldn't say his actual reasons for disagreeing, which\nviolated several basic principles of cooperative discourse.",
      "He couldn't explain how Bellatrix had really been removed from\nAzkaban - not by You-Know-Who in any guise, but by the combined\nwits of Harry and Professor Quirrell.",
      "Harry didn't want to say in front of Professor McGonagall that\nthe existence of brain damage implied that there were no such\nthings as souls. Which made a successful immortality ritual...\nwell, not impossible, Harry certainly intended to forge a\nroad to magical immortality someday, but it would be a\nlot harder and require much more ingenuity than\njust binding an already-existent soul to a lich's phylactery. Which\nno intelligent wizard would bother doing in the first place, if\nthey knew their souls were immortal.",
      "And the true and honest reason Harry knew the Dark Lord couldn't\nhave been that smart... well... there wasn't any tactful\nway to say it, but...",
      "Harry had been to a convocation of the Wizengamot. He'd\nseen the laughable 'security precautions', if you could\ncall them that, guarding the deepest levels of the Ministry of\nMagic. They didn't even have the Thief's Downfall which goblins\nused to wash away Polyjuice and Imperius Curses on people entering\nGringotts. The obvious takeover route would be to Imperius the\nMinister of Magic and a few department heads, and owl a hand\ngrenade to anyone too powerful to Imperius. Or owl them knockout\ngas, if you needed them alive and in a state of Living Death to\ntake hairs for Polyjuice potions. Legilimency, False Memories, the\nConfundus Charm - it was ridiculous, the magical world was\nsupersaturated with ways to cheat. Harry might not do any\nof those things himself, during his own takeover of Britain, since\nhe was constrained by Ethics... well, Harry might do some\nof the lesser ones, since Polyjuice or a temporary Confundus or\nread-only Legilimency all sounded better than an extra day of\nAzkaban... but...",
      "If Harry hadn't been constrained by Ethics, it was possible he\ncould've wiped out the eviller sections of the Wizengamot that day;\nall by himself, using only a first-year's magical power, on account\nof being clever enough to figure out Dementors. Though Harry might\nnot have been in such a great political position after that, the\nsurviving Wizengamot members might've found it easy and cheap to\ndisavow his actions for P.R. purposes and condemn him, even if the\nsmarter ones realized it was for the greater good... but\nstill.",
      "If you were completely unrestrained by ethics, armed with the\nancient secrets of Salazar Slytherin, had dozens of powerful\nfollowers including Lucius Malfoy, and it took you more than ten\nyears to fail to overthrow the government of magical\nBritain, it meant you were stupid.",
      "\"How can I put this...\" Harry said. \"Look, Headmaster, you've\ngot ethics, there's a lot of battle tactics you don't use because\nyou're not evil. And you fought the Dark Lord, a tremendously\npowerful wizard who wasn't so restrained, and you held him off\nanyway. If You-Know-Who had been super-smart on top of\nthat, you'd be dead. All of you. You'd have\ndied instantly -\"",
      "\"Harry,\" Professor McGonagall said. Her voice was faltering.\n\"Harry, we almost did all die. More than half the Order of\nthe Phoenix died. If not for Albus - Albus Dumbledore, the greatest\nwizard in two centuries, Harry - we surely would have\nperished.\"",
      "Harry passed a hand across his forehead. \"I'm sorry,\" Harry\nsaid. \"I'm not trying to minimize what you went through. I know\nthat You-Know-Who was a completely evil, incredibly powerful Dark\nWizard with dozens of powerful followers, and that's... bad, yes,\ndefinitely bad. It's just...\" All that isn't on remotely the\nsame threat scale as the enemy being smart, in which case they\nTransfigure botulinum toxin and sneak a millionth of a gram into\nyour teacup. Was there any safe way to convey that concept\nwithout citing specifics? Harry couldn't think of one.",
      "\"Please, Harry,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Please, Harry, I\nbeg you - take the Dark Lord seriously! He is more\ndangerous than -\" The senior witch seemed to be having trouble\nfinding words. \"He is far more dangerous than\nTransfiguration.\"",
      "Harry's eyebrows went up before he could stop himself. A dark\nchuckle came from Severus Snape's direction.",
      "Um, said the voice of Ravenclaw within him. Um,\nhonestly Professor McGonagall is right, we're not taking this as\nseriously as we'd take a scientific problem. The difficult thing is\nto react at all to new information, instead of just\nflushing it out the window. Right now it looks like we didn't shift\nbelief at all after encountering an unexpected, important\nargument. Our dismissal of Lord Voldemort as a serious threat\nwas originally based on the Dark Mark being blatantly stupid.\nIt would require a focused effort to de-update and suspect the\nwhole garden-path of reasoning we went down based on that false\nassumption, and we're not putting in that effort right\nnow.",
      "\"All right,\" Harry said, just as Professor McGonagall seemed to\nbe about to speak again. \"All right, to take this seriously, I need\nto stop and think for five minutes.\"",
      "\"Please do,\" said Albus Dumbledore.",
      "Harry closed his eyes.",
      "His Ravenclaw side divided into three.",
      "Probability estimate, said Ravenclaw One, who was\nacting as moderator. That the Dark Lord is alive, and as smart\nas we are, and hence a genuine threat.",
      "Why aren't all his enemies already dead? said Ravenclaw\nTwo, who was prosecuting.",
      "Note, said Ravenclaw One, we had already thought of\nthat argument so we can't use it to shift belief again\neach time we rehearse it.",
      "But what's the actual flaw in the logic? said Ravenclaw\nTwo. In worlds with a smart Lord Voldemort, everyone in the\nOrder of the Phoenix died in the first five minutes of the war. The\nworld doesn't look like that, so we don't live in that world.\nQED.",
      "Is that really certain? asked Ravenclaw Three, who'd\nbeen appointed as the defender. Maybe there was some reason\nLord Voldemort wasn't fighting all-out back then\n-",
      "Like what? demanded Ravenclaw Two. Furthermore,\nwhatever your excuse, I demand that the probability of your\nhypothesis be penalized in accordance with its added complexity\n-",
      "Let Three talk, said Ravenclaw One.",
      "Okay... look, said Ravenclaw Three. First of all,\nwe don't know that anyone can take over the Ministry just\nwith mind control. Maybe magical Britain is really an oligarchy and\nyou need enough military power to intimidate the family heads into\nsubmission -",
      "Imperius them too, interjected Ravenclaw Two.",
      "- and the oligarchs have Thief's Downfall in the entrances\nto their homes -",
      "Complexity penalty! cried Ravenclaw Two. More\nepicycles!",
      "- oh, be reasonable, said Ravenclaw Three. We\nhaven't actually seen anyone taking over the Ministry with\na couple of well-placed Imperius curses. We don't know\nthat it can actually be done that easily.",
      "But, said Ravenclaw Two, even taking that into\naccount... it really seems like there should've been some\nother way. Ten years of failure, really? Using only\nconventional terrorist tactics? That's just... not even\ntrying.",
      "Maybe Lord Voldemort did have more creative ideas,\nreplied Ravenclaw Three, but he didn't want to tip his hand\nto other countries' governments, didn't want them\nto know how vulnerable they were and install Thief's Downfall\nin their Ministries. Not until he had Britain as a base\nand enough servants to subvert all the other major\ngovernments simultaneously.",
      "You're assuming he wants to conquer the whole world,\nnoted Ravenclaw Two.",
      "Trelawney prophesized that he would be our equal,\nintoned Ravenclaw Three solemnly. Therefore, he wanted to take\nover the world.",
      "And if he is your equal, and you do have to fight him\n-",
      "For an instant, Harry's mind tried to imagine the specter of two\ncreative wizards fighting an all-out-war against each\nother.",
      "Harry had noted all the Charms and Potions in his first-year\nbooks that could be creatively used to kill people. He hadn't been\nable to help himself. Literally. He'd tried to stop his\nbrain from doing it each time, but it was like looking at a fish\nand trying to stop your brain from noticing it was a fish. What\nsomeone could creatively do with seventh-year, or Auror-level, or\nancient lost magic such as Lord Voldemort had possessed... didn't\nbear thinking about. A magically-superpowered creative-genius\npsychopath wasn't a 'threat', it was an extinction event.",
      "Then Harry shook his head, dismissing the gloomy line his\nreasoning had been going down. The question was whether there was a\nsignificant probability of facing anything so terrible as a Dark\nRationalist in the first place.",
      "Prior odds that someone attempting an immortality ritual\nwould actually have it work...",
      "Call it one to a thousand, at a generous overestimate; it was\nnot the case that roughly one wizard in a thousand survived their\ndeath. Though, admittedly Harry didn't have data on how many had\nattempted immortality rituals first.",
      "What if the Dark Lord is as smart as us? said\nRavenclaw Three. You know, the way Trelawney prophesied him\nbeing our equal. Then he would make his\nimmortality ritual work. P.S., don't forget that 'destroy\nall but a remnant of the other' line.",
      "Requiring that level of intelligence was an additional\nburdensome detail; prior odds of a random population member being\nthat intelligent were low...",
      "But Lord Voldemort wasn't a randomly selected wizard, he was one\nparticular wizard in the population who'd come to everyone's\nattention. The puzzle of the Mark implied a certain minimum level\nof intelligence, even if (hypothetically) the Dark Lord had taken\nlonger to think it through. Then again, in the Muggle world, all of\nthe extremely intelligent people Harry knew about from history had\nnot become evil dictators or terrorists. The closest thing\nto that in the Muggle world was hedge-fund managers, and none of\nthem had tried to take over so much as a third-world\ncountry, a point which put upper bounds on both their possible evil\nand possible goodness.",
      "There were hypotheses where the Dark Lord was smart and the\nOrder of the Phoenix didn't just instantly die, but those\nhypotheses were more complicated and ought to get complexity\npenalties. After the complexity penalties of the further excuses\nwere factored in, there would be a large likelihood ratio from the\nhypotheses 'The Dark Lord is smart' versus 'The Dark Lord was\nstupid' to the observation, 'The Dark Lord did not instantly win\nthe war'. That was probably worth a 10:1 likelihood ratio in favor\nof the Dark Lord being stupid... but maybe not 100:1. You couldn't\nactually say that 'The Dark Lord instantly wins' had a probability\nof more than 99 percent, assuming the Dark Lord started\nout smart; the sum over all possible excuses would be more than\n.01.",
      "And then there was the Prophecy... which might or might not have\noriginally included a line about how Lord Voldemort would\nimmediately die if he confronted the Potters. Which Albus\nDumbledore had then edited in Professor McGonagall's memory, in\norder to lure Lord Voldemort to his doom. If there was no\nsuch line, the Prophecy did sound somewhat more like\nYou-Know-Who and the Boy-Who-Lived were destined to have some later\nconfrontation. But in that case, it was less likely that\nDumbledore would've come up with a plausible-sounding excuse not to\ntake Harry to the Hall of Prophecy...",
      "Harry was wondering if he could even get a Bayesian\ncalculation out of this. Of course, the point of a subjective\nBayesian calculation wasn't that, after you made up a bunch of\nnumbers, multiplying them out would give you an exactly right\nanswer. The real point was that the process of making up\nnumbers would force you to tally all the relevant facts and weigh\nall the relative probabilities. Like realizing, as soon as you\nactually thought about the probability of the Dark Mark\nnot-fading if You-Know-Who was dead, that the\nprobability wasn't low enough for the observation to count as\nstrong evidence. One version of the process was to tally hypotheses\nand list out evidence, make up all the numbers, do the calculation,\nand then throw out the final answer and go with your brain's gut\nfeeling after you'd forced it to really weigh\neverything. The trouble was that the items of evidence weren't\nconditionally independent, and there were multiple interacting\nbackground facts of interest...",
      "...well, one thing at least was certain.",
      "If the calculation could be done at all, it was going to take a\npiece of paper and a pencil.",

      "\"Let this matter bide for now,\" the Headmaster said in some\nrelief, as he too turned to regard the Floo. \"I believe we are\nabout to receive some news regarding it, as well.\"",

      "Meanwhile in the Great Hall of Hogwarts, as the students who\ndidn't have secret meetings with the Headmaster bustled about their\ndinner around four huge tables -",
      "\"It's funny,\" Dean Thomas said thoughtfully. \"I didn't believe\nthe General when he said that what we learned would change us\nforever, and we'd never be able to return to a normal life\nafterward. Once we knew. Once we saw what he could\nsee.\"",
      "\"I know!\" said Seamus Finnigan. \"I thought it was just a joke\ntoo! Like, you know, everything else General Chaos ever said\never.\"",
      "\"But now -\" Dean said sadly. \"We can't go back, can we?\nIt'd be like going back to a Muggle school after having been to\nHogwarts. We've just... we've just got to stay around each other.\nThat's all we can do, or we'll go crazy.\"",
      "Seamus Finnigan, next to him, just nodded wordlessly and ate\nanother bite of veldbeest.",
      "Around them, the conversation at the Gryffindor table continued.\nIt wasn't as relentless as it'd been yesterday, but now\nand then the topic wandered back.",
      "\"Well, there must've been some sort of love triangle,\"\nsaid a second-year witch named Samantha Crowley (she never answered\nwhen asked if there was any relation). \"The question is, which ways\nwas it going before it all went wrong? Who was in love\nwith who - and whether or not that person loved them back - I don't\nknow how many possibilities there are -\"",
      "\"Sixty-four,\" said Sarah Varyabil, a blossoming beauty who\nprobably should've been Sorted into Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff\ninstead. \"No, wait, that's wrong. I mean, if nobody loved Malfoy\nand Malfoy didn't love anyone then he wouldn't really be part of\nthe love triangle... this is going to take Arithmancy, could you\nall wait two minutes?\"",
      "\"I, for one, think it perfectly clear that Granger is\nPotter's moirail, and that Potter was auspisticing between Malfoy\nand Granger.\" The witch who'd spoken nodded with the\nself-satisfaction of someone who has just precisely nailed down a\ncomplicated issue.",
      "\"Those aren't even words,\" objected a young wizard. \"You're just\nmaking them up as you go.\"",
      "\"Sometimes you can't describe a thing using real\nwords.\"",
      "\"It's so sad,\" said Sherice Ngaserin, who actually had\ntears in her eyes. \"They were just - they were just so\nobviously meant to be together!\"",
      "\"You mean Potter and Malfoy?\" said a second-year named Colleen\nJohnson. \"I know - their families hated each other so much, there's\nno way they couldn't fall in love -\"",
      "\"No, I mean all three of them,\" said Sherice.",
      "This produced a brief pause in the huddled conversation. Dean\nThomas was quietly choking on his lemonade, trying not to make any\nsounds as it trickled out of his mouth and soaked into his\nshirt.",
      "\"Wow,\" said a dark-haired witch by the name of Nancy\nHua. \"That's really... sophisticated of you, Sherice.\"",
      "\"Look, you all, we need to keep this realistic,\" said Eloise\nRosen, a tall witch who'd been General of an army and hence spoke\nwith an air of authority. \"We know - because she kissed\nhim - that Granger was in love with Potter. So the only reason\nshe'd try to kill Malfoy is if she knew that she was losing Potter\nto him. There's no need to make it all sound so complicated -\nyou're all acting like this is a play instead of real life!\"",
      "\"But even if Granger was in love, it's still funny that she'd\njust snap like that,\" said Chloe, whose black robes\ncombined with her night-black skin to make her look like a darkened\nsilhouette. \"I don't know... I think maybe there's more to this\nthan just a romance novel gone wrong. I think maybe most people\nhaven't got any idea at all what's going on.\"",
      "\"Yes! Thank you!\u202f\" burst out Dean Thomas. \"Look - don't\nyou realize - like Harry Potter told us all - if you\ndidn't predict that something would happen, if it took you\ncompletely by surprise, then what you believed about the world when\nyou didn't see it coming, isn't enough to explain...\"\nDean's voice trailed off, as he saw that nobody was listening.\n\"It's completely hopeless, isn't it?\"",
      "\"You hadn't figured that out yet?\" said Lavender Brown, who was\nsitting across the table from her two fellow former Chaotics.\n\"How'd you ever make Lieutenant?\"",
      "\"Oh, you two be quiet!\" Sherice snapped at them. \"It's obvious\nyou both want the three of them for yourselves!\"",
      "\"I mean it!\" Chloe said. \"What if what's really going\non is different from all the, you know, normal things that\nall the ordinary people are talking about? What if\nsomebody - made Granger do what she did, just like Potter\nwas trying to tell everyone?\"",
      "\"I think Chloe's right,\" said a foreign-looking boy wizard who\nalways introduced himself as 'Adrian Turnipseed', though his\nparents had actually named him Mad Drongo. \"I think this whole time\nthere's been...\" Adrian lowered his voice ominously, \"...a\nhidden hand...\" Adrian raised his voice again, \"shaping\nall that's happened. One person who's been behind\neverything, from the beginning. And I don't mean Professor\nSnape, either.\"",
      "\"You don't mean -\" gasped Sarah.",
      "\"Yes,\" Adrian said. \"The real one behind it all is -\nTracey Davis!\u202f\"",
      "\"That's what I think too,\" Chloe said. \"After all -\" She glanced\naround rapidly. \"Ever since that thing with the bullies and the\nceiling - even the trees in the forests around Hogwarts look like\nthey're shaking, like they're afraid -\"",

      "\"Oh, I totally know what you mean,\" Lavender said. She didn't\nbother to lower her own voice. \"It's a wonder he didn't crack and\njust start killing everyone ages ago.\"",
      "\"Personally,\" Dean said, also in a quieter voice, \"I'd say the\nreally scary part is - that could've been us.\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Lavender. \"It's a good thing we're all\nperfectly sane now.\"",

      "The Floo-Fire of the Headmaster's office blazed a bright\npale-green, the fire concentrating in on itself into a spinning\nemeraldine whirlwind, and then flared even brighter and spit a\nhuman figure into the air -",
      "There was a blur of motion as the resolving figure snapped up a\nwand, smoothly spinning with the Floo's momentum like a ballet\ndance step, so that his firing arc covered the entire 360-degree\narc of the room; and then just as abruptly, the figure stopped in\nplace.",
      "In the first instant that Harry saw that man, before Harry even\ntook in the eye, he noticed the scars on the hands, the scars on\nthe face, like the man had been burned and cut over his entire\nbody; though only the man's hands and face were visible, of all his\nflesh. The rest of the man's body was hidden, encased not in robes,\nbut in leather that looked more like armor than clothing; dark gray\nleather, matching the man's mess of grayed hair.",
      "The next thing that Harry's vision comprehended was the\nbrilliant blue eye occupying the right side of the man's face.",
      "One part of Harry's mind realized that the person whom Professor\nMcGonagall had named 'Mad-Eye Moody' was the same as the one\nDumbledore had called 'Alastor', within the memory Dumbledore had\nshown Harry; an image from before whatever event had scarred every\ninch of the man's body and taken a chunk out of his nose -",
      "And another part of his mind noticed the jolt of adrenaline.\nHarry had drawn his wand in sheer reflex when the man had spun out\nof the Floo like that, there'd been something about it that felt\nlike ambush, Harry's hand had already started to level his\nwand for a Somnium before he'd managed to stop himself.\nEven now the armored man was holding his wand level, not pointed at\nany particular person but covering the whole room, and that wand\nwas already in perfect line with his eyes, like a soldier sighting\ndown a gun. There was danger in the man's stance and the set of his\nboots, danger in the leather armor he wore and danger in that\nbrilliant blue eye.",
      "When the scarred man spoke, addressing the Headmaster, his voice\nwas edged. \"I suppose you think this room is secure?\"",
      "\"There are only friends here,\" Dumbledore said.",
      "The man's head jerked toward Harry. \"That include\nhim?\u202f\"",
      "\"If Harry Potter is not our friend,\" Dumbledore said gravely,\n\"then we are all certainly doomed; so we may as well assume that he\nis.\"",
      "The man's wand stayed level, not quite pointing at Harry. \"Boy\nalmost drew on me just then.\"",
      "\"Er...\" Harry said. He noticed that his hand was still tightly\nholding the wand, and consciously relaxed his hand and dropped it\nback to his side. \"Sorry about that, you looked a bit...\ncombat-ready.\"",
      "The scarred man's wand moved slightly away from where it had\nalmost pointed at Harry, though it didn't lower, and the man let\nout a short bark of laughter. \"Constant vigilance, eh, lad?\" said\nthe man.",
      "\"It's not paranoia if they really are out to get you,\" Harry\nrecited the proverb.",
      "The man turned fully toward Harry; and insofar as Harry could\nread any expression on the scarred face, the man now looked\ninterested.",
      "Dumbledore's eyes had regained some of the brilliant twinkle\nthat they'd had before the Azkaban breakout, a smile beneath his\nsilver mustache as though that smile had never left. \"Harry, this\nis Alastor Moody, called also Mad-Eye, who will command the Order\nof the Phoenix after me - if anything should happen to me, that is.\nAlastor, this is Harry Potter. I have every hope the two of you\nshall get along fantastically.\"",
      "\"I've heard a good deal about you, boy,\" said Mad-Eye Moody. His\none dark natural eye stayed fixed on Harry, while the point of\nbrilliant blue spun frantically, seeming to rotate all the way\naround within its socket. \"Not all of it good. Heard they're\ncalling you the Dementor Spooker, in the Department.\"",
      "After some consideration, Harry decided to reply with a knowing\nsmile.",
      "\"How'd you pull off that one, boy?\" the man said softly. Now his\nblue eye was fixed on Harry as well. \"I had a little chat with one\nof the Aurors who escorted the Dementor there from Azkaban. Beth\nMartin said it came straight from the pit, and no-one gave it any\nspecial instructions along the way. Of course, she could be\nlying.\"",
      "\"There wasn't any sneaky trick to that one,\" Harry said. \"I just\ndid it the hard way. Of course, I could also be lying.\"",
      "Dumbledore was leaning back in his chair, chuckling in the\nbackground, like he was just another device in the Headmaster's\nOffice and that was the sound he made.",
      "The scarred man turned back to face the Headmaster, though his\nwand stayed pointed low and in Harry's general direction. When he\nspoke his voice was gruff and businesslike. \"I have a lead on a\nrecent host of Voldie's. You're certain his shade is in Hogwarts\nnow?\"",
      "\"Not certain -\" Dumbledore began.",
      "\"Say what?\u202f\" Harry interrupted. After having nearly\nconcluded that the Dark Lord didn't exist, it was a shock to hear\nit being discussed that matter-of-factly.",
      "\"Voldie's host,\" Moody said shortly. \"The one he possessed\nbefore he took over Granger.\"",
      "\"If the tales speak true,\" Dumbledore said, \"there is some\ndevice of power which binds Voldemort's shade to this world; and by\nthat means he may bargain with a host for possession of their body,\nconferring on them some portion of his power and his pride -\"",
      "\"So the obvious question is who's gained too much power too\nquickly,\" Moody said abruptly. \"And it turns out that there's a\nfellow who's gone and banished the Bandon Banshee, staked an entire\nrogue vampire clan in Asia, tracked down the Wagga-Wagga Werewolf,\nand exterminated a pack of ghouls using a tea-strainer.\nAnd he's milking it for all it's worth; there's been talk\nof the Order of Merlin. Seems to have turned into a charmer and a\npolitician, not just a powerful wizard.\"",
      "\"Dear me,\" murmured Dumbledore. \"Are you certain that he is not\nrelying on his own skills?\"",
      "\"Checked his grades,\" Moody said. \"Record shows Gilderoy\nLockhart received a Troll in his Defense O.W.L.S., didn't bother\nwith the N.E.W.T. Just the sort of sucker to take the deal Voldie\nwas offering.\" The blue eye whirled crazily within its socket.\n\"Unless you remember Lockhart as a student, and think he had enough\npotential to do all that by himself?\"",
      "\"No,\" said Professor McGonagall. She frowned. \"Not a chance, I\nshould say.\"",
      "\"I fear I must agree,\" Dumbledore said with an undertone of\npain. \"Ah, Gilderoy, you poor fool...\"",
      "Moody's grin was more like a snarl. \"Three in the morning work\nfor you, Albus? Lockhart should be at his home tonight.\"",
      "Harry listened to this with increasing alarm, wondering if even\nthe Ministry had any rules about magistrates needing to\nissue warrants - never mind the illegal vigilante organization\nHarry now seemed to have joined. \"Excuse me,\" Harry said. \"What\nexactly happens at three in the morning?\"",
      "There must have been something in Harry's voice that gave him\naway, because the scarred man whirled on him. \"You have a problem\nwith that, boy?\"",
      "Harry paused, trying to figure out how to phrase this to the\nstranger -",
      "\"You want to take him down yourself?\" pressed the scarred man.\n\"Get revenge for your parents, eh?\"",
      "\"No,\" Harry said as politely he could. \"Honestly - look, if we\nknew for certain he was a willing host for You-Know-Who,\nthat's one thing, but if we're not sure and you're heading\noff to kill him -\"",
      "\"Kill?\" Mad-Eye Moody snorted. \"It's what's locked up in his\nhead,\" Moody tapped his forehead, \"that we need from him, boy. If\nwe're lucky, Voldie can't wipe the sucker's memories as easy as in\nhis living days, and Lockhart will remember what the horcrux looked\nlike.\"",
      "Harry mentally noted down the word horcrux for future\nresearch, and said, \"I'm just worried that someone innocent - what\nsounds like a pretty decent person, if he did do all that\nhimself - might be about to get hurt.\"",
      "\"Aurors hurt people,\" the scarred man said shortly. \"Bad people,\nif you're lucky. Some days you won't be lucky, and that's all there\nis to it. Just remember, Dark Wizards hurt a lot more people than\nwe do.\"",
      "Harry took a deep breath. \"Can you at least try not to\nhurt this person, in case he's not -\"",
      "\"What is a first-year doing in this room, Albus?\" demanded the\nscarred man, now whirling to face the Headmaster. \"And don't tell\nme it's for what he did when he was a baby.\"",
      "\"Harry Potter is not an ordinary first-year,\" the Headmaster\nsaid quietly. \"He has already accomplished feats impossible enough\nto shock even me, Alastor. His is the only intellect in the Order\nwhich might someday match that of Voldemort himself, as you or I\nnever could.\"",
      "The scarred man leaned over the Headmaster's desk. \"He's a\nliability. Naive. Doesn't know a bloody thing about what war's\nlike. I want him out of here and all his memories of the Order\nwiped before one of Voldie's servants plucks them straight out of\nhis mind -\"",
      "\"I'm an Occlumens, actually.\"",
      "Mad-Eye Moody directed a narrow look at the Headmaster, who\nnodded.",
      "And then the scarred man turned to face Harry, their gazes\nmeeting.",
      "The sudden fury of the Legilimency attack almost made Harry fall\noff his chair, as a blade of white-hot steel cut into the imaginary\nperson at the forefront of his mind. Harry hadn't had a chance to\npractice since Mr. Bester's training, and Harry very nearly lost\nhis grip on the imaginary person the back-of-his-mind was\npretending to be, as that person's world turned into searing lava\nand a furious probe of questions. Harry almost lost his grip on\nonly pretending to hallucinate, only pretending\nto be the imaginary person that was screaming in shock and pain as\nthe Legilimency tore apart his sanity and reshaped him to believe\nthat he was on fire -",
      "Harry managed to break eye contact, dropping his eyes to Moody's\nchin.",
      "\"You're out of practice, boy,\" Moody said. Harry wasn't looking\nat the man's face, but his voice was deadly grim. \"And I'll warn\nyou of this but once. Voldie isn't like any other Legilimens in\nrecorded history. He doesn't need to look you in the eyes, and if\nyour shields are that rusty he'd creep in so softly you'd never\nnotice a thing.\"",
      "\"Duly noted,\" Harry said to the scarred chin. Harry was more\nshaken than he'd have admitted; Mr. Bester hadn't been anywhere\nnear that powerful, and had never tested Harry like that.\nPretending to be someone hurting that much had... Harry couldn't\nfind words for describing what it felt like to contain an imaginary\nperson in that much pain, but it hadn't been normal. \"Do I\nget any credit for being an Occlumens in the first place?\"",
      "\"So you're think you're all grown up already, eh? Look me in the\neyes!\"",
      "Harry strengthened his shields, and looked once more into the\ndark grey eye and the brilliant blue.",
      "\"Ever watched someone die?\" asked Mad-Eye Moody.",
      "\"My parents,\" Harry said evenly. \"I recovered the memory in\nJanuary when I went in front of a Dementor to learn the Patronus\nCharm. I remember You-Know-Who's voice -\" A chill went through\nHarry's body, his wand twitching in his hand. \"My main tactical\nreport is that You-Know-Who could speak the Killing Curse in less\nthan half a second, but you probably already knew that.\"",
      "There was a gasp from Professor McGonagall's direction, and\nSeverus's face had tightened.",
      "\"All right,\" Mad-Eye Moody said softly. A strange, thin grin\ntwisted up the lips within the scarred face. \"I'll make you the\nsame offer I'd make to any trainee Auror. Land one touch on me, boy\n- one hit, one spell - and I'll concede your right to talk back to\nme.\"",
      "\"Alastor!\" exclaimed Professor McGonagall's voice. \"Surely\nthat's an unreasonable test! Mr. Potter, whatever his other merits,\ndoes not have a hundred years of fighting experience!\"",
      "Harry's eyes made a lightning dart around the room, passing over\nthe peculiar devices, glancing past Dumbledore and Severus and the\nSorting Hat, settling briefly here and there. Harry couldn't see\nProfessor McGonagall from where he was, but that didn't matter.\nThere was only one device he'd really wanted to look at, and the\npoint of all the other glances had just been to conceal which\none.",
      "\"All righty,\" Harry said, and hopped off his chair, ignoring\nProfessor McGonagall's inhalation and the Potions Master's snort of\ndisbelief. Dumbledore's eyebrows had lifted, and Moody was grinning\nlike a tiger. \"Be sure to wake me up in forty minutes if he does\nget me.\" Harry settled into a duelist's starting stance, his wand\nheld low. \"Let's go, then -\"",
      "Harry opened his eyes, his head feeling like it had been stuffed\nwith cotton wool.",
      "Everyone else was gone from the Headmaster's office, the\nFloo-Fire dimmed; only Dumbledore still waited behind the desk.",
      "\"Hello, Harry,\" the Headmaster said quietly.",
      "\"I didn't even see him move,\" Harry marvelled, muscles\ncreaking as he sat up.",
      "\"You were standing two paces away from Alastor Moody,\" said\nDumbledore, \"and you took your eye off his wand.\"",
      "Harry nodded, as he took the Cloak of Invisibility out of his\npouch. \"I mean - I was taking the dueling stance so that he'd think\nI was a standard idiot and underestimate me - but I have to admit,\nthat was impressive.\"",
      "\"So you planned it all along, Harry?\" Dumbledore said.",
      "\"Of course,\" Harry said. \"Note how I'm doing this as soon as I\nwake up, rather than pausing to think of it.\"",
      "Harry drew the hood of the Cloak over his head, and glanced back\nup at the wall clock he'd surreptitiously glanced at earlier.",
      "It had then shown around twenty-three minutes after eight, and\nnow it was five minutes after nine.",
      "Minerva stared as the boy put himself into the dueling stance,\nhis wand held low. For a second Minerva wondered if Harry might\npossibly - no, that was completely ridiculous, it was Mad-Eye\nMoody and that was beyond impossible. Of course that was what\nshe'd thought about his partial Transfiguration, too...",
      "\"Let's go, then,\" Harry said and fell over.",
      "Severus gave a single chuckle. \"Mr. Potter has his points, I\nmust confess,\" the Potions Master said. \"Though I would never say\nit while he was awake, and if you repeat the words I shall deny\nthem, for the boy's ego is quite large enough already. Mr. Potter\ndoes have his points, Mad-Eye, but duelling is not among them.\"",
      "Mad-Eye's own chuckle was lower and grimmer. \"Oh, yes,\" said\nMad-Eye. \"Only fools duel. Standing like that and waiting for me to\nattack, what was the boy thinking? Why, I ought to give\nhim a scar, to remember this occasion -\"",
      "\"Alastor!\" barked Albus, just as she cried \"Stop!\", Severus\ndashed forward, and Mad-Eye Moody deliberately leveled his wand on\nHarry Potter's body.",
      "\"Stupefy!\u202f\"",
      "Mad-Eye's body seemed to almost flicker as he spun on his wooden\nfoot like lightning, faster than she'd ever seen anyone move\nwithout magic, the red Stunning Hex passing through the suddenly\nempty air and barely missing Severus to crash into the opposite\nwall, and by the time her eyes jerked back to Moody there were\nseventeen radiant orbs in the pattern of a Sagitta Magica,\nvisible for only an instant before they streaked brilliance and\nstruck something that fell to the floor with a thud -",
      "\"Hello again, Harry,\" said Dumbledore.",
      "\"I cannot believe that guy's reaction time,\" Harry\nsaid, brushing off his Cloak as he stood up from where he'd been\nlying invisible on the floor, unseen by his previous self. \"I can't\nbelieve his movement speed either. I'm going to have to figure out\nsome way to zap him without speaking an incantation that gives it\naway...\"",
      "- and then Mad-Eye ducked hard and fast, his hands hitting flat\non the floor. She almost didn't see the two tiny white threads\npassing through the space he'd been, but her eyes went to the blue\nspark when the threads impacted on one of the Headmaster's devices,\nand by the time she managed to turn her eyes back, Mad-Eye had spun\nsmoothly up to his feet, his wand was dancing unseeably fast and\nthere was another thudding sound -",
      "\"Hello again, Harry.\"",
      "\"Pardon me, Headmaster, but could you let me go down your\nstairs, and then come back up again, before I make the final jump\nbackward? This is going to take longer than one hour of preparation\n-\"",
      "Minerva gaped at Mad-Eye Moody, who hadn't lowered his wand in\nthe slightest; and Severus had a look on his face that was almost\nlike shock.",
      "\"Well, boy?\" said Mad-Eye Moody. \"What else have you got?\"",
      "Harry Potter's head appeared, floating in midair as an invisible\nhand drew back the hood of his invisibility cloak.",
      "\"That eye,\" said Harry Potter. There was a strange fierce light\nin the boy's eyes. \"That isn't any ordinary device. It can see\nright through my invisibility cloak. You dodged my Transfigured\ntaser as soon as I started raising it, even though I didn't speak\nany incantations. And now that I've watched it again - you spotted\nall my Time-Turned selves the moment you Flooed into this room,\ndidn't you?\"",
      "Mad-Eye Moody was smiling, the same teeth-bared grin she'd seen\nhim wear as they'd faced off against Voldemort himself. \"Spend a\nhundred years hunting Dark wizards, and you see everything,\" said\nMoody. \"I once arrested a young Japanese who tried a similar trick.\nHe found out the hard way that his shadow replica technique was no\nmatch for this eye of mine.\"",
      "\"You see in all directions,\" Harry Potter said, that strange\nfierce light still in his gaze. \"No matter where that eye is\npointing, it sees everything around you.\"",
      "Moody's tiger-grin grew wider. \"There's no more of you in this\nroom, now,\" Mad-Eye said. \"Think that's because you'll give up\nafter this time, or because you'll win? Any bets, boy?\"",
      "\"It's my final attempt because I decided to stake my last three\nhours on one shot,\" said Harry Potter. \"As for whether I win -\"",
      "There was a blur filling the whole air of the Headmaster's\noffice. Mad-Eye Moody leapt to one side with blinding speed and an\ninstant later Harry's head darted backward as he cried\n\"Stuporfy!\u202f\"",
      "Three shimmers in the air went past Harry's moving head, just as\na red bolt erupted from Harry's location, shooting past Moody as he\ndodged in yet another direction -",
      "If she'd blinked, she would have missed it, the red bolt making\nan angled turn in midair and slamming into Moody's ear.",
      "Moody fell.",
      "Harry Potter's floating head dropped to the height of a\nfirst-year on their hands and knees, then dropped further to the\nground, his face showing sudden exhaustion.",
      "Minerva McGonagall said, \"What in Merlin's name just\n-\"",
      "\"So you went to Flitwick, then,\" Moody said. The retired Auror\nwas now sitting in a chair, drinking long draughts from a\nrestorative in a bottle he'd taken off his belt.",
      "Harry Potter nodded, now sitting in his own chair instead of\nperched on an armrest. \"I tried the Defense Professor first, but -\"\nThe boy grimaced. \"He... wasn't available. Well, I'd decided it was\nworth risking five House points, and if you say a risk is worth it,\nyou can't complain when you have to pay up. Anyway, I figured that\nif you had an eye that saw things other people couldn't see, then\nas Isaac Asimov pointed out in Second Foundation, the\nweapon to use is a brilliant light. Read enough science fiction,\nyou know, and you'll read everything at least once. Anyway, I told\nProfessor Flitwick that I needed a Charm that would make a huge\nnumber of shapes, bright and flickering and filling the whole\noffice, but invisible, so only your eye could see them. I had no\nidea what it would even mean to cast an illusion and then\nmake it invisible, but I figured if I didn't mention that out loud,\nProfessor Flitwick would just do it anyway, and he did. Turns out\nthere was no spell like that I could cast myself, but Flitwick\nCharmed me a one-time device for it - though I had to persuade him\nthat it wasn't cheating, since nothing could possibly be\ncheating against an Auror who'd lived long enough to retire. And\nthen I still didn't see how I could hit you, when you were moving\nthat fast. So I asked about targeted spells, and that was when\nFlitwick showed me that hex I cast at the end, the Swerving\nStunner. It's one of Professor Flitwick's own inventions - he's a\nchampion duellist as well as a Charms Master -\"",
      "\"I know that, son.\"",
      "\"Sorry. Anyway, the Professor says he left the duelling circuit\nbefore he got a chance to use that spell, since it only works as a\nfinishing move on an unshielded opponent. The hex gets as close to\nthe target as possible along its original trajectory, and then once\nit detects that the target is getting more distant again, the hex\nturns in midair and heads straight for the target. It can only\nswerve once - but the incantation sounds very close to 'Stupefy'\nand the hex is the same red color, so if the enemy thinks it's a\nregular Stunning Hex and tries a normal dodge, that midair\nretargeting will finish them off. Oh, and the Professor requested\nthat none of us talk about his special move, just in case he does\nget a chance to use it during competition someday.\"",
      "\"But -\" said Professor McGonagall. She glanced at Mad-Eye Moody,\nwho was nodding his approval, and at Severus, who was keeping his\nface decidedly blank. \"Mr. Potter, you just stunned Mad-Eye\nMoody! The most famous Dark wizard hunter in the history of\nthe Auror Office! That should've been impossible!\"",
      "Moody let out a dark chuckle. \"What's your answer to\nthat one, kid? I'm curious.\"",
      "\"Well...\" Harry said. \"First of all, Professor McGonagall,\nneither of us were fighting seriously.\"",
      "\"Neither of you?\"",
      "\"Of course,\" Harry said. \"In a serious fight, Mr. Moody would've\ndropped all my copies immediately without waiting for them to\nattack. And on my side, if it was actually necessary to\ntake down the most famous Auror in the history of the office, I'd\nget Headmaster Dumbledore to do it for me. And beyond that... since\nthat wasn't a real fight...\" Harry paused. \"How can I put\nthis? Wizards are used to duels where people fight back and forth\nwith spells for a while. But if two Muggles with guns stand in a\nsmall room and fire bullets at each other... then whoever hits\nfirst, wins. And if one of them is deliberately missing his shots,\ngiving the other person one chance after another - like Mr. Moody\ngave me one chance after another - well, you'd have to be pretty\npathetic to lose.\"",
      "\"Oh, not that pathetic,\" Moody said with a slightly\nthreatening grin.",
      "Harry didn't seem to notice. \"You might say that Mr. Moody was\ntesting me to see if I would try to fight him, or try to\nwin. That is, whether I'd carry out the role of\nsomebody fighting - use standard spells I already knew, even though\nI didn't expect the consequences of that action to be\nvictory - or if I'd search through unusual plans until I found\nsomething that could win. Like the difference between a\nstudent who sits in class because that's what students do, versus a\nstudent who cares enough to ask themselves what it takes to\nactually learn a piece of material, and practices however\nnecessary - you see, Professor McGonagall? When you look at it that\nway - realize that Mr. Moody was giving me chances, and that I\nshouldn't attack in the first place unless I think I can win - then\nI don't come out looking so well, since it actually took me three\ntries to get him. Plus, like I said, in a real fight Mr. Moody\ncould've turned himself invisible, or put up shields\n-\"",
      "\"Don't go relying too much on shields, boy,\" Mad-Eye said. The\nleather-clad Auror took another sip from his restorative flask.\n\"What you learn in your first year at the academy doesn't stay true\nforever, not against the strongest Dark Wizards. Every shield ever\nmade, there's some curse that goes straight through it, if you're\nnot quick enough to cast the counter. And there's one curse that\ngoes through everything, and it's a curse any Death Eater will\nuse.\"",
      "Harry Potter nodded gravely. \"Right, some spells are impossible\nto block. I'll remember that, in case anyone casts the Killing\nCurse at me. Again.\"",
      "\"That kind of cleverness gets people killed, boy, and don't you\nforget it.\"",
      "A sad-sounding sigh from the Boy-Who-Lived. \"I know. Sorry.\"",
      "\"So, son. You had something to say about when Albus and I go\nafter Lockhart?\"",
      "Harry opened his mouth, then paused. \"I won't tell you how to\nrun a war,\" the Boy-Who-Lived said eventually. \"I don't have any\nexperience at that. All I know is that there are consequences.\nPlease be advised that my own assessment is that Lockhart is\nprobably innocent, so if you can avoid hurting him without too much\nrisk -\" The boy shrugged. \"I don't know the cost. Just please, if\nyou can, be careful not to hurt him if he's innocent.\"",
      "\"If I can,\" said Moody.",
      "\"And - you're aiming to look through his mind for evidence about\nthe Dark Lord, aren't you? I don't know what the rules are in\nmagical Britain about admissible evidence - but everyone's always\nguilty of breaking some law or another, there's just too\nmany laws. So if it's not about the Dark Lord, don't turn\nhim in to the Ministry, just Obliviate him and go, okay?\"",
      "Moody frowned. \"Son, nobody gains power that fast without being\nup to something.\"",
      "\"Then leave it for the ordinary Aurors, if and when they find\nevidence the ordinary way. Please, Mr. Moody. Call it a quirk of my\nMuggle upbringing, but if it's not about the war I don't\nwant us to be the evil police who break into people's houses in the\nmiddle of the night, rummage through their minds and send them off\nto Azkaban.\"",
      "\"I don't see the sense of it, son, but I suppose I could do you\nthe favor.\"",
      "\"Is there aught else, Alastor?\" inquired Albus.",
      "\"Yes,\" said Moody. \"About that Defense Professor of yours -\"",
      "Hypothesis: Gilderoy Lockhart: END",
      "Hypothesis: Dumbledore\n(April 9th, 1992, 5:32pm)",
      "As Professor Quirrell slowly raised up his tea, the teacup\njerked in midair, sending the dark translucent liquid just barely\nslopping over the side, so that only three single drops crawled\ndown the side of the teacup. Harry would have missed it, if he\nhadn't happened to be watching closely; for Professor Quirrell's\nhand was perfectly steady on the cup before and after.",
      "If that small jerky motion advanced to a constant tremor, it\nwould be the end of any non-wandless magic for the Defense\nProfessor. Wandwork had no room for trembling fingers. How much\nthat would actually handicap Professor Quirrell, if at\nall, Harry couldn't guess. The Defense Professor was certainly\ncapable of wandless magic, yet still tended to use a wand for\nlarger things - but for him that might only be a convenience...",
      "\"Insanity,\" said Professor Quirrell, as he carefully sipped from\nhis tea - he was looking at the teacup, not at Harry, which was\nunusual for him - \"can be a signature all its own.\"",
      "The Defense Professor's small office was silent, the\nsound-warded room quiet in a way the Headmaster's office never\ncould be. Sometimes the two of them both happened to finish\nexhaling or inhaling at the same time; and then there was an\nauditory emptiness that was almost a sound in itself.",
      "\"I'll agree with that in one sense,\" Harry said. \"If somebody\ntells me that everyone is staring at them and that their\nunderwear is being dusted with thought-controlling powder, I know\nthey're psychotic, because that's the standard signature of\npsychosis. But if you tell me that anything confusing\npoints to Albus Dumbledore as a suspect, that seems...\noverreaching. Just because I can't see a purpose doesn't mean there\nis no purpose.\"",
      "\"Purposeless?\" said Professor Quirrell. \"Oh, but the madness of\nDumbledore is not that he is purposeless, but that he has too many\npurposes. The Headmaster might have planned this to make Lucius\nMalfoy throw away his game for vengeance on you - or it might be a\ndozen other plots. Who knows what the Headmaster thinks he has\nreason to do, when he has found reason to do so many strange things\nalready?\"",
      "Harry had politely declined tea, even knowing that Professor\nQuirrell would know what it meant. He'd considered bringing his own\ncan of soda - but had decided against that as well, after realizing\nhow easy it would be for the Defense Professor to teleport in a bit\nof potion, even if the two of them couldn't touch each other with\ndirect magic.",
      "\"I have seen a little now of Dumbledore,\" Harry said. \"Unless\neverything I have seen is a lie, I find it difficult to believe\nthat he would plot to send any Hogwarts student to Azkaban.\nEver.\"",
      "\"Ah,\" the Defense Professor said softly, the tiny reflection of\nthe teacup gleaming in his pale eyes. \"But perhaps that is another\nsignature, Mr. Potter. You have not yet comprehended the\nperspective of a man like Dumbledore. If he must, in some\nsufficiently noble cause, sacrifice a student - why, who would he\nchoose, but she who declared herself a heroine?\"",
      "That gave Harry some pause. It might just be hindsight bias, but\nthat did seem to concentrate some of that hypotheses's\nprobability mass onto framing Hermione in particular. Similarly,\nProfessor Quirrell had predicted in advance that\nDumbledore might target Draco...",
      "But if it's you behind all of this, Professor, you might\nhave shaped your plans to frame the Headmaster, and taken care to\ncast suspicion on him in advance.",
      "The concept of 'evidence' had something of a different meaning,\nwhen you were dealing with someone who had declared themselves to\nplay the game at 'one level higher than you'.",
      "\"I see your point, Professor,\" Harry said evenly, giving no hint\nof his other thoughts. \"So you think it most probable that it was\nthe Headmaster who framed Hermione?\"",
      "\"Not necessarily, Mr. Potter.\" Professor Quirrell drained his\nteacup in one swallow and then set it down, the cup making a sharp\nrap as it descended. \"There is also Severus Snape - though what he\nmight think to gain from this, I could not guess. Thus he is not my\nprime suspect either.\"",
      "\"Then who is?\" Harry said, somewhat puzzled. Professor Quirrell\nsurely wasn't about to reply 'You-Know-Who' -",
      "\"The Aurors have a rule,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"Investigate\nthe victim. Many would-be criminals imagine that if they are the\napparent victims of a crime, they shall not be suspected. So many\ncriminals imagine it, indeed, that every senior Auror has seen it a\ndozen times over.\"",
      "\"You're not seriously trying to convince me that\nHermione -\"",
      "The Defense Professor was giving Harry one of those slit-eyed\nlooks that meant he was being stupid.",
      "Draco? Draco had been interrogated under Veritaserum -\nbut Lucius might have had enough control to subvert Aurors to...\noh.",
      "\"You think Lucius Malfoy set up his own son?\u202f\"\nHarry said.",
      "\"Why not?\" Professor Quirrell said softly. \"From Mr. Malfoy's\nrecorded testimony, Mr. Potter, I gather that you enjoyed some\nsuccess in changing Mr. Malfoy's political views. If Lucius Malfoy\nlearned of that earlier... he might have decided that his\nformer heir had become a liability.\"",
      "\"I don't buy it,\" Harry said flatly.",
      "\"You are being wantonly naive, Mr. Potter. The history books are\nfull of family disputes turned murderous, for inconveniences and\nthreats far less than those which Mr. Malfoy posed to his father. I\nsuppose next you will tell me that Lord Malfoy of the Death Eaters\nis far too gentle to wish his son such harm.\" A tinge of heavy\nsarcasm.",
      "\"Well, yes, frankly,\" Harry said. \"Love is real, Professor, a\nphenomenon with observable effects. Brains are real, emotions are\nreal, and love is as much a part of the real world as apples and\ntrees. If you made experimental predictions without taking parental\nlove into account, you'd have a heck of a time explaining why my\nown parents didn't abandon me at an orphanage after the Incident\nwith the Science Project.\"",
      "The Defense Professor did not react to this at all.",
      "Harry continued. \"From what Draco says, Lucius prioritized him\nover important Wizengamot votes. That's significant evidence, since\nthere's less expensive ways to fake love, if you just want to fake\nit. And it's not like the prior probability of a parent loving\ntheir child is low. I suppose it's possible that Lucius\nwas just taking on the role of a loving father, and he\nrenounced that role after he learned Draco was consorting with\nMuggleborns. But as the saying goes, Professor, one must\ndistinguish possibility from probability.\"",
      "\"All the better the crime,\" the Defense Professor said, still in\nthat soft tone, \"if no one would believe it of him.\"",
      "\"And how would Lucius even Memory-Charm Hermione in the first\nplace, without setting off the wards? He's not a Professor\n- oh, right, you think it's Professor Snape.\"",
      "\"Wrong,\" said the Defense Professor. \"Lucius Malfoy would trust\nno servant with that mission. But suppose some Hogwarts Professor,\nintelligent enough to cast a well-formed Memory Charm but of no\ngreat fighting ability, is visiting Hogsmeade. From a dark alley\nthe black-clad form of Malfoy steps forth - he would go in person,\nfor this - and speaks to her a single word.\"",
      "\"Imperio.\"",
      "\"Legilimens, rather,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"I do\nnot know if the Hogwarts wards would trigger for a returning\nProfessor under the Imperius Curse. And if I do not know, Malfoy\nprobably does not know either. But Malfoy is a perfect Occlumens at\nleast; he might be able to use Legilimency. And for the\ntarget...perhaps Aurora Sinistra; none would question the Astronomy\nProfessor moving about at night.\"",
      "\"Or even more obviously, Professor Sprout,\" said Harry. \"Since\nshe's the last person anyone would suspect.\"",
      "The Defense Professor hesitated minutely. \"Perhaps.\"",
      "\"Actually,\" Harry said then, putting a thoughtful frown on his\nface, \"I don't suppose you know offhand if any of the current\nProfessors at Hogwarts were around back when Mr. Hagrid got framed\nin 1943?\"",
      "\"Dumbledore taught Transfiguration, Kettleburn taught Magical\nCreatures, and Vector taught Arithmancy,\" Professor Quirrell said\nat once. \"And I believe that Bathsheda Babbling, now of Ancient\nRunes, was then a Ravenclaw prefect. But Mr. Potter, there is no\nreason to suppose that anyone besides You-Know-Who was involved in\nthat affair.\"",
      "Harry shrugged artfully. \"Seemed worth asking the question, just\nto check. Anyway, Professor, I agree it's possible that some\noutsider Legilimized a member of Hogwarts staff - and then\nObliviated them afterward, there's no way anyone would forget that\npart. But I don't think Lucius Malfoy is a probable\ncandidate for the mastermind. It's possible but not probable that\nall of Lucius's apparent love for Draco was just a sense of duty,\nand that it all went up in a puff of smoke. It's possible though\nnot probable that everything Lucius did in front of the Wizengamot\nwas just an act. People's outsides do not always resemble their\ninsides, like you said. But there's one piece of evidence that\ndoesn't fit at all.\"",
      "\"And that would be?\" said the Defense Professor, his eyes\nhalf-lidded.",
      "\"Lucius tried to reject a hundred thousand Galleons for\nHermione's life. I saw how surprised the Wizengamot was, when\nLucius said he was refusing it despite the rules of honor. The\nWizengamot didn't expect that of him. Why\nwouldn't he just take the money while acting all indignant\nand pretending to grit his teeth? He wouldn't actually care that\nmuch about throwing Hermione into Azkaban.\"",
      "There was a pause. \"Perhaps the role he was playing ran away\nwith him,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"It does happen, Mr. Potter, in\nthe heat of the moment.\"",
      "\"Perhaps,\" Harry said. \"But it's still one more\nimprobability to be postulated - and by the time you have\nto add up that many excuses in a theory, it can't be at the top of\nthe list anymore. Anything else in particular you think I ought to\nthink about, within the range of all other possibilities?\"",
      "There was a long silence. The Defense Professor's eyes dropped\ndown to look at the empty teacup before them, seeming unusually\ndistant.",
      "\"I suppose I can think of one final suspect,\" the Defense\nProfessor said at last.",
      "Harry nodded.",
      "The Defense Professor didn't seem to notice, but only spoke on.\n\"Has the Headmaster has told you anything - even a hint - about\nProfessor Trelawney's prophecy?\"",
      "\"Huh?\u202f\" Harry said automatically, converting his own\nsudden shock into the best dissembling he could manage. It probably\nwas at the wrong level to fool Professor Quirrell but Harry\ncertainly couldn't take time to think before replying -\nwait, but how on Earth would Professor Quirrell know about\nthat - \"Professor Trelawney made a prophecy?\"",
      "\"You were there to hear its beginning,\" Professor\nQuirrell said, frowning. \"You called out to the entire school that\nthe prophecy could not be about you, since you were not coming\nhere, you were already here.\"",
      "HE IS COMING. THE ONE WHO WILL TEAR APART THE VERY\n-",
      "And that was as far as Professor Trelawney had gotten before\nDumbledore had grabbed her and vanished.",
      "\"Oh, that prophecy,\" Harry said. \"Sorry! It went clear\nout of my mind.\"",
      "Harry thought he'd put too much force into the end statement,\nand was 80%-expecting Professor Quirrell to say, Aha, now Mr.\nPotter, what is this mysterious other prophecy you went to\nsuch lengths to deny -",
      "\"That is foolish,\" the Defense Professor said sharply, \"if\nindeed you are telling me the truth. Prophecies are not trivial\nthings. I have racked my brain much over the little that I heard,\nbut such a small fragment is simply too little.\"",
      "\"You think the one who's coming is the one who might've framed\nHermione?\" said Harry. As his mind allocated yet another\nhypothesis, uncertain predicate referent,\nhe-who-is-coming.",
      "\"With no offense meant to Miss Granger,\" the Defense Professor\nsaid with another frown, \"her life or death does not seem that\nimportant. But someone was to come - one who, in your\ninterpretation, was not already there - and someone so significant,\nand unknown as a player... who knows what else they may\nhave done?\"",
      "Harry nodded, and mentally sighed because he was going to have\nto redo his Lord-Voldemort odds calculation with yet another piece\nof evidence in the mix.",
      "Professor Quirrell spoke with eyes half-lidded, looking out like\nthrough slits. \"More than the question of whom the prophecy spoke -\nwho was meant to hear it? It is said that fates are spoken\nto those with the power to cause them or avert them. Dumbledore.\nMyself. You. As a distant fourth, Severus Snape. But of those four,\nDumbledore and Snape would often be in Trelawney's presence. You\nand I are the ones who would not have spent much time around her\nbefore that Sunday. I think it quite likely that the prophecy was\nmeant for one of us - before Dumbledore took the\nprophetess away. Did the Headmaster say nothing more to\nyou?\" Professor Quirrell's voice was demanding now. \"I thought I\nheard too much force in that denial, Mr. Potter.\"",
      "\"Honestly, no,\" Harry said. \"It had honestly slipped clear out\nof my mind.\"",
      "\"Then I am rather put out with him,\" Professor Quirrell said\nsoftly. \"In fact, I think that I am angry.\"",
      "Harry said nothing. He didn't even sweat. It might've been a\npoor reason for confidence, but on this particular score, Harry did\nhappen to be innocent.",
      "Professor Quirrell nodded once, sharply, as though in\nacknowledgment. \"If there is nothing more to say between us, Mr.\nPotter, you may go.\"",
      "\"I can think of one other suspect,\" Harry said.\n\"Someone you didn't put on your list at all. Would you analyze him\nto me, Professor?\"",
      "There was another of those moments of silence that was almost a\nsound in itself.",
      "\"As for that suspect,\" the Defense Professor said\nsoftly, \"I think you shall prosecute him on your own, Mr. Potter,\nwithout help from me.

      "\"It was an unalterable condition of his employment, or so he\nsaid.\" Dumbledore glanced at Professor McGonagall, a wry smile\nbriefly flitting over his face. \"And Minerva made it clear to me\nthat Hogwarts required a competent Defense Professor this\nyear, even if I had to haul Grindelwald out of Nurmengard and\nprevail on old affections to persuade him to take the\nposition.\"",
      "\"I did not quite phrase it in that fashion -\"",
      "\"Your expression said it for you, my dear.\"",
      "And so soon the four of them - Harry, Professor McGonagall, the\nPotions Master, and Alastor Moody aka 'Mad-Eye' - were ensconced\nall by themselves in the Headmaster's office.",
      "It was strange how the Headmaster's office seemed...\nunbalanced... without the Headmaster in it. If you didn't\nhave the ancient wizened master to make it all seem\nsolemn, you were just four people trying to have a serious\nmeeting while surrounded by bizarre, noisy gidgets. Clearly visible\nfrom where Harry had perched himself on his chair's arm was a\ntruncated-conical object, like a cone with its top snipped off,\nslowly spinning around a pulsating central light which it shaded\nbut did not obscure; and each time the inner light pulsated, the\nassembly made a vroop-vroop-vroop sound that sounded oddly\ndistant, muffled like it was coming from behind four solid walls,\neven though the spinning-conical-section thingy was only a meter or\ntwo away.",
      "Vroop... vroop... vroop...",
      "And then there were the various still-breathing bodies of Harry\nPotter he'd stashed in one quiet corner, cleaning up a mess that\nwas his own in more ways than one. (Only one body wasn't\ninside a copy of the Invisibility Cloak; but then it merely took a\nsmall effort of concentration for Harry to perceive his other\nselves beneath the Cloak of which he was master - an effort which\nHarry had carefully not put forth earlier, to avoid\ngetting advance temporal information he wanted to determine by his\nown decision.) The sad thing was that by this point, having his own\nbody visibly lying in a corner didn't seem all that crazy. It was\njust... Hogwarts.",
      "\"All right, then,\" Moody said, looking rather sour about it.\nFrom within his leather armor, the scarred man took out a black\nfolder. \"This is a copy of what Amelia's people put together. She\nalmost certainly knows we've got it, but it's all off the books,\nthat clear? Anyway -\"",
      "And Moody told them who the Department of Magical Law\nEnforcement thought 'Quirinus Quirrell' really was. A seemingly\nordinary Hogwarts student (though talented enough that he'd been\nonly narrowly beaten out for the Head Boy position) who'd gone\nvacationing in Albania after his graduation, disappeared, returned\nafter 25 years, and then been caught up in the Wizarding War -",
      "\"It was murdering the House of Monroe that made Voldie's name,\"\nMoody said. \"Until then, he was just another Dark Wizard with\ndelusions of grandeur and Bellatrix Black. But after that -\" Moody\nsnorted. \"Every fool in the country flocked to serve him. You\nwould've hoped the Wizengamot would turn serious, once\nthey realized Voldie was willing to kill their own sacred selves.\nAnd that's just what the bastards did - hope that some\nother bastard would turn serious. None of the cowards wanted to\nstep in front. It was Monroe, Crouch, Bones, and Longbottom. That\nwas nearly everyone in the Ministry who'd dare say a word that\nmight give Voldie offense.\"",
      "\"That was how your House came to be ennobled, Mr. Potter,\"\ninjected the solemn voice of Professor McGonagall. \"There is an\nancient law that if anyone ends a Most Ancient House, whoever\navenges that blood will be made Noble. To be sure, the House of\nPotter was already older than some lines called Ancient. But yours\nwas titled a Noble House of Britain after the end of the war, in\nrecognition that you had avenged the Most Ancient House of\nMonroe.\"",
      "\"Flush of gratitude and all that,\" Mad-Eye Moody said sourly.\n\"It didn't last, but at least James and Lily got a fancy title and\na useless medal to take to their graves. But that's leaving out\neight years of complete horror after Monroe disappeared and Regulus\nBlack - he was Monroe's private source in the Death Eaters, we're\npretty sure - was executed by Voldie. Like a dam breaking and gore\nflooding out, drowning the whole country. Albus bloody Dumbledore\nhimself had to step into Monroe's shoes, and that was barely enough\nfor us to survive.\"",
      "Harry listened with an odd sense of unreality. Some of it\nfelt right, matched up with observation - especially with\nthe speech Professor Quirrell had made before Christmas - and\nyet...",
      "This was Professor Quirrell they were talking\nabout.",
      "\"So that's who the Department thinks is your Defense Professor,\"\nMad-Eye Moody finished up his account. \"Now what do you\nthink, son?\"",
      "\"Well...\" Harry said slowly. It is also possible to have a\nmask behind the mask. \"The obvious next thought is that this\n'David Monroe' person died in the war after all, and this is just\nsomeone else pretending to be David Monroe pretending to be\nQuirinus Quirrell.\"",
      "\"That's obvious?\u202f\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Dear\nMerlin...\"",
      "\"Really, boy?\" said Mad-Eye Moody, his blue eye spinning\nrapidly. \"I'd say that's a little... paranoid.\"",
      "You don't know Professor Quirrell, Harry did not say.\n\"It's an easy theory to test,\" Harry said out loud. \"Just check\nwhether the Defense Professor remembers something about the war\nthat the real David Monroe would've known. Though I suppose, if\nhe's playing the part of David Monroe pretending to be\nsomeone else, he has a good excuse to pretend he's\npretending he doesn't know what you're talking about -\"",
      "\"A little paranoid,\" said the scarred man, his voice\nrising. \"Not paranoid enough! CONSTANT VIGILANCE! Think\nabout it, lad - what if the real David Monroe never came\nback from Albania?\"",
      "There was a pause.",
      "\"I see...\" Harry said.",
      "\"Of course you do,\" Professor McGonagall said. \"Don't mind me,\nplease. I'll just sit here quietly going mad.\"",
      "\"In this line of work, if you survive, you learn that there's\nthree kinds of Dark Wizards,\" Moody said grimly; his wand wasn't\npointed at anyone, it was angled slightly downward, but it was in\nhis hand. It had never left his hand since the moment he'd entered\nthe room. \"There's Dark Wizards that have one name. There's Dark\nWizards that have two names. And there's Dark Wizards that change\nnames like you and I change clothes. I saw 'Monroe' go through\nthree Death Eaters like he was snapping twigs. There's not many\nwizards that good at age forty-five. Dumbledore, maybe, but not\nmany others.\"",
      "\"Perhaps that is true,\" said the Potions Master from where he\nwas lurking. \"But what of it, Mad-Eye? Whatever his identity,\nMonroe was surely the Dark Lord's enemy. I've heard Death Eaters\ncurse his name even after they thought him dead. They feared him\nwell.\"",
      "\"So far as Defense Professors are concerned,\" Professor\nMcGonagall said primly, \"I shall take it and be grateful.\"",
      "Moody swung around to glare at her. \"Just where the devil was\n'Monroe' all those years he was gone, eh? Maybe he thought he could\nmake a name for himself in Britain by opposing Voldie, and vanished\naway when he found out he was wrong. Then why'd he come back\nnow, hah? What's his new plan?\"",
      "\"He, ah...\" Harry ventured tentatively. \"He says he\nalways wanted to be a great Defense Professor because all the best\nfighting wizards have taught at Hogwarts. And he kind of\nis being an incredibly good Defense Professor, actually...\nI mean, if he just wanted to keep up a disguise, he could get away\nwith much sloppier work...\"",
      "Professor McGonagall was nodding firmly.",
      "\"Naive,\" Moody said flatly. \"I suppose you all haven't wondered\nif your Defense Professor set up the whole House of Monroe to be\nwiped out?\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" cried Professor McGonagall.",
      "\"Our mystery wizard hears about a missing kid from a Most\nAncient House of Britain,\" Moody said. \"Steps into the shoes of\n'David Monroe', but stays away from the real Monroe family. But\neventually the House is bound to notice something wrong. So this\nimposter somehow prods Voldie into wiping them all out - maybe\nleaked a password they'd given him for their wards - and then he\nwas a Lord of the Wizengamot!\"",
      "There seemed to be a fight going on inside Harry's mind between\nHufflepuff One, who'd never trusted the Defense Professor in the\nfirst place; and Hufflepuff Two, who was far too loyal to Harry's\nfriend, Professor Quirrell, to believe something like that just\nbecause Moody said so.",
      "It is kind of obvious, though, observed his\nSlytherin part. I mean, do you actually believe that under\nnatural circumstances, anyone would end up as the last heir to a\nMost Ancient House AND Lord Voldemort killed his family AND he has\nto avenge his martial arts sensei? If anything I'd say he went too\nfar over the top in setting up his new identity as the ideal\nliterary hero. That sort of thing doesn't happen in real\nlife.",
      "This from an orphan who was raised unaware of his\nheritage, commented Harry's Inner Critic. With a prophecy\nabout him. You know, I don't think we've ever read a story about\ntwo equally destined heroes competing to see who's cliched enough\nto take down the villain -",
      "Yes, replied the central Harry over the distant\nvroop-ing noise in the background, it's a very sad life we lead\nand YOU'RE NOT HELPING.",
      "There's only one thing to do at this point, said\nRavenclaw. And we all know what it is, so why argue?",
      "But, Harry replied, how do we test\nexperimentally whether or not Professor Quirrell is the original\nDavid Monroe? I mean, what sort of observable behaves differently,\ndepending on whether he's the real David Monroe or an\nimpostor?",
      "\"What do you want me to do about it, Mad-Eye?\" Professor\nMcGonagall was demanding. \"I can't -\"",
      "\"You can,\" the scarred man said, glaring at her fiercely. \"Just\nfire the bloody Defense Professor.\"",
      "\"You say that every year,\" said Professor\nMcGonagall.",
      "\"Yes, and I'm always right!\"",
      "\"Constant vigilance or no, Alastor, the students must be\ntaught!\"",
      "Moody snorted. \"Pfah! I swear the curse gets worse every year,\nas you lot get more and more reluctant to let them go. Your\nprecious Professor Quirrell would have to be Grindelwald\nin disguise, to get himself sent off!\"",
      "\"Is he?\" Harry couldn't help asking. \"I mean, could he\nactually be -\"",
      "\"I check Grindie's cell every two months,\" Moody said. \"He was\nthere in March.\"",
      "\"Could the person in the cell be a ringer?\"",
      "\"I administer a blood test for his identity, son.\"",
      "\"Where do you keep the blood you use as a reference?\"",
      "\"In a safe place.\" Something like a smile was stretching the\nscarred lips. \"Have you considered the Auror Office after you\ngraduate?\"",
      "\"Alastor,\" Professor McGonagall said reluctantly. \"The Defense\nProfessor does have a... health condition. I suppose you\nwill call it suspicious in itself - but it is by no means certain\nthat it will be any ill-doing on his part which prevents us from\nrenewing his employment.\"",
      "\"Yes, his little naptimes,\" Moody said darkly. \"Amelia thinks he\nstepped into the path of a high-level curse. Sounds to me\nmore like a Dark ritual gone wrong!\"",
      "\"You've no proof of that!\" Professor McGonagall said.",
      "\"That man might as well be wearing a sign saying 'Dark Wizard'\nin glowing green letters over his head.\"",
      "\"Ah...\" Harry said. It didn't seem like an especially good time\nto ask what Mr. Moody thought of the 'not all sacrificial rituals\nare evil' standpoint. \"Excuse me, but you said earlier that\nProfessor Quirrell - I mean the old David Monroe - I mean the\nMonroe from the seventies - anyway, you said that person used the\nKilling Curse. What does that imply? Does somebody have to be a\nDark Wizard to use it?\"",
      "Moody shook his head. \"I've used it myself. All it takes is\npower and a certain mood.\" The grimacing lips were showing\nteeth. \"The first time I cast it was against a wizard named Gerald\nGrice, and you can ask me what he did after you graduate\nHogwarts.\"",
      "\"But why is it Unforgiveable, then?\" Harry said. \"I mean, a\nCutting Hex can kill someone too. So why's it any better to use a\nReducto instead of Avada Kedav-\"",
      "\"Shut your mouth!\" Moody said sharply. \"Someone might take it\nthe wrong way, your saying that incantation. You look too\nyoung to cast it, but there's such a thing as Polyjuice. And to\nanswer your question, boy, there's two reasons why that spell's in\nthe blackest book. The first is that the Killing Curse strikes\ndirectly at the soul, and it'll just keep going until it hits one.\nStraight through shields. Straight through walls. There's\na reason why even Aurors fighting Death Eaters weren't\nallowed to use it before the Monroe Act.\"",
      "\"Ah,\" said Harry. \"That does seem like an excellent reason to\nban -\"",
      "\"I'm not finished, son. The second reason is that the Killing\nCurse doesn't just take a powerful bit of magic. You've\ngot to mean it. You've got to want someone dead,\nand not for the greater good, either. Killing Grice didn't bring\nback Blair Roche, or Nathan Rehfuss, or David Capito. It wasn't for\njustice, or to stop him doing it again. I wanted him dead.\nYou understand now, lad? You don't have to be a Dark Wizard to use\nthat spell - but you can't be Albus Dumbledore, either. And if\nyou're arrested for killing with it, there's no possible\ndefense.\"",
      "\"I... see,\" murmured the Boy-Who-Lived. You can't want the\nperson dead as an instrumental value on the way to some positive\nfuture consequence, you can't cast it if you believe it's a\nnecessary evil, you have to actually want them dead for the sake of\nbeing dead, as a terminal value in your utility function. \"A\nmagically embodied preference for death over life, striking within\nthe plane of pure life force... that does sound like a difficult\nspell to block.\"",
      "\"Not difficult,\" Moody snapped. \"Impossible.\"",
      "Harry nodded gravely. \"But David Monroe - or whoever - used the\nKilling Curse against a couple of Death Eaters even before\nthey wiped out his family. Does that mean he already had to hate\nthem? Like, the martial arts story was probably true?\"",
      "Moody shook his head slightly. \"One of the dark truths of the\nKilling Curse, son, is that once you've cast it the first time, it\ndoesn't take much hate to do it again.\"",
      "\"It damages the mind?\"",
      "Again Moody shook his head. \"No. It's the killing that does\nthat. Murder tears the soul - but that's just the same if it's a\nCutting Hex. The Killing Curse doesn't crack your soul. It just\ntakes a cracked soul to cast.\" If there was a sad expression on the\nscarred face, it could not be read. \"But that doesn't tell us much\nabout Monroe. The ones like Dumbledore who'll never be able to cast\nthe Curse all their lives, because they never crack no matter what\n- they're the rare ones, very rare. It only takes a little\ncracking.\"",
      "There was a strange heavy feeling in Harry's chest. He'd\nwondered what exactly it had meant, that Lily Potter had tried to\ncast the Killing Curse at Lord Voldemort with her last breath. But\nsurely it was forgiveable, it was right and\nproper for a mother to hate the Dark Wizard who was coming\nto kill her baby, mocking her for how she couldn't stop him. There\nwas something wrong with you as a parent if you couldn't\ncast Avada Kedavra, in that situation. And no other spell could've\ngone past the Dark Lord's shields; you'd have to at least\ntry to hate the Dark Lord enough to want him dead for the\nsake of dead, if that was the only way to save your baby.",
      "It only takes a little cracking...",
      "\"Enough,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"What would you have us\ndo?\"",
      "Moody's smile twisted. \"Get rid of the Defense Professor and see\nif all your troubles mysteriously clear up. Bet you a Galleon they\ndo.\"",
      "Professor McGonagall looked like she was in pain. \"Alastor - but\n- will you teach the classes, if -\"",
      "\"Ha!\" said Moody. \"If I ever say yes to that question, check me\nfor Polyjuice, because it's not me.\"",
      "\"I'll test it experimentally,\" Harry said. And then, as everyone\nlooked at him, \"I'll ask Professor Quirrell a question that the\nreal David Monroe would know - like who else was in the Slytherin\nclass of 1945, or something like that - hopefully without making it\nobvious. It won't be definitive proof, he could've studied the\nrole, but it would be evidence. Still, Mr. Moody, even if Professor\nQuirrell isn't the original Monroe, I'm not sure that getting rid\nof him is a free action. He saved my life twice -\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" demanded Moody. \"When? How?\"",
      "\"Once when he knocked down a bunch of witches who were summoning\nme toward the ground, once when he figured out that the Dementor\nwas draining me through my wand. And if Professor Quirrell\nwasn't the one who set up Draco Malfoy in the first place,\nthen he saved Draco Malfoy's life, and things would be a lot worse\nif he hadn't. If the Defense Professor isn't behind it all\n- he's not someone we can afford to just get rid of.\"",
      "Professor McGonagall nodded firmly.",
      "Hypothesis: Severus Snape(April 8th,\n1992, 9:03pm)",
      "Harry and Professor McGonagall now stood on the slowly turning\nstairs, turning without descending; or at least one Harry\nstood upon those stairs - his other three selves had been left\nbehind in the Headmaster's office.",
      "\"Can I ask you a private question?\" Harry said, when he thought\nthey were far enough away not to be heard. \"And in particular,\nprivate from the Headmaster.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Professor McGonagall said, not quite sighing. \"Though I\nhope you realize that I cannot do anything which conflicts\nwith my duties to -\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry said, \"that's exactly what I need to ask you about.\nIn front of the Wizengamot, when Lucius Malfoy was saying that\nHermione was no part of House Potter and that he wouldn't take the\nmoney, you told Hermione how to swear that oath. I want to know, if\nsomething like that comes up again, if your first duty is to the\nHogwarts student Hermione Granger, or to the head of the Order of\nthe Phoenix, Albus Dumbledore.\"",
      "Professor McGonagall looked like someone had hit her in the face\nwith a cast-iron frying-pan, a few minutes earlier, and now she'd\nbeen told that somebody was about to do it again, and not to\nflinch.",
      "Harry flinched a little himself. Somewhere along the line he\nneeded to pick up the knack of not phrasing things to hit\nas hard as he possibly could.",
      "The walls rotated around them, behind them, and somehow, they\ndescended.",
      "\"Oh, Mr. Potter,\" Professor McGonagall said with a low\nexhalation. \"I... wish you wouldn't ask me such\nquestions... oh, Harry, I wasn't thinking then, not at all. I only\nsaw a chance to help Miss Granger and... I was Sorted into\nGryffindor, after all.\"",
      "\"You've got a chance to think now,\" Harry said. It was all\ncoming out wrong, but he had to say it anyway, because -\n\"I'm not asking you to be loyal to me. But if you do know\n- if you are sure - what you'll do if it comes down to an\ninnocent Hogwarts student versus the Order of the Phoenix a second\ntime...\"",
      "But Professor McGonagall shook her head. \"I'm not\nsure,\" the Transfiguration Professor whispered. \"I don't know if it\nwas the right choice even then. I'm sorry. I can't decide such\nawful things!\"",
      "\"But you'll do something if it happens again,\" Harry\nsaid. \"Indecision is also a choice. You can't just imagine\nhaving to make an immediate decision?\"",
      "\"No,\" Professor McGonagall said, sounding a little stronger; and\nHarry realized that he'd accidentally offered a way out. The\nProfessor's next words confirmed Harry's fears. \"Such a dreadful\nchoice as that, Mr. Potter - I think I should not make it until I\nmust.\"",
      "Harry gave an internal sigh. He supposed he had no right to\nexpect Professor McGonagall to say anything else. In a moral\ndilemma where you lost something either way, making the choice\nwould feel bad either way, so you could temporarily save\nyourself a little mental pain by refusing to decide. At the cost of\nnot being able to plan anything in advance, and at the cost of\nincurring a huge bias toward inaction or waiting until too late...\nbut you couldn't expect a witch to know all that. \"All right,\"\nHarry said.",
      "Though it wasn't right at all, not really. Dumbledore might want\nthat debt removed, Professor Quirrell would also want Harry out of\nthat debt. And if the Defense Professor was David Monroe,\nor could convincingly appear to be David Monroe, then Lord\nVoldemort technically hadn't exterminated the House of\nMonroe. In which case somebody might be able to pass a Wizengamot\nresolution revoking the Noble status of House Potter, which had\nbeen granted for avenging the Most Ancient House of Monroe.",
      "In which case Hermione's vow of service to a Noble House might\nbe null and void.",
      "Or maybe not. Harry didn't know anything about the legalities,\nespecially not whether House Potter got the money back if\nsomeone managed to send Hermione to Azkaban. Just because you lost\nsomething might not mean the payment was returned, legally\nspeaking. Harry wasn't sure and he didn't dare ask a magical\nsolicitor...",
      "...it would have been nice to be able to trust at least one\nadult to take Hermione's side instead of Dumbledore's, if an issue\nlike that threatened to come up.",
      "The stairs they were upon ceased rotating, and they were before\nthe backs of the great stone gargoyles, which rumbled aside,\nrevealing the hallway.",
      "Harry stepped out -",
      "A hand caught at Harry's shoulder.",
      "\"Mr. Potter,\" Professor McGonagall said in a low voice, \"why did\nyou to tell me to keep watch over Professor Snape?\"",
      "Harry turned around again.",
      "\"You told me to keep watch, and see if he'd changed,\" Professor\nMcGonagall went on, her tone urgent. \"Why did you say\nthat, Mr. Potter?\"",
      "It took a moment, at this point, for Harry to think back and\nremember why he had said that. Harry and Neville had\nrescued Lesath Lestrange from bullies, and then Harry had\nconfronted Severus in the hallway and, at least according to the\nPotions Master's own words, 'almost died' -",
      "\"I learned something that made me worry,\" Harry said after a\nmoment. \"From someone who made me promise not to tell anyone else.\"\nSeverus had made Harry swear that their conversations wouldn't be\nshared with anyone, and Harry was still bound by it.",
      "\"Mr. Potter -\" began Professor McGonagall, and then\nexhaled, the flash of sharpness disappearing as quickly as it had\ncome. \"Never mind. If you cannot say, you cannot say.\"",
      "\"Why do you ask?\" Harry said.",
      "Professor McGonagall seemed to hesitate -",
      "\"All right, let me be more specific,\" Harry said. After\nProfessor Quirrell had done it to him several times, Harry\nwas starting to get the hang of it. \"What change have you\nalready observed in Professor Snape that you're trying to\ndecide whether to tell me about?\"",
      "\"Harry -\" the Transfiguration Professor said, and then closed\nher mouth.",
      "\"I obviously know something you don't,\" Harry said\nhelpfully. \"See, this is why we can't always put off trying to\ndecide our awful moral dilemmas.\"",
      "Professor McGonagall closed her eyes, drew in a deep breath,\npinched the bridge of her nose and squeezed it several times. \"All\nright,\" she said. \"It's a subtle thing... but worrying. How can I\nput this... Mr. Potter, have you read many books that young\nchildren are not meant to read?\"",
      "\"I've read all of them.\"",
      "\"Of course you have. Well... I don't quite understand it myself,\nbut for so long as Severus has been employed in this school,\nstalking about in that awful stained cloak, there has been a\ncertain sort of girl that stares at him with longing eyes\n-\"",
      "\"You say that like it's a bad thing?\" Harry said. \"I mean, if\nthere's one thing I did understand from those books, it's\nthat you're not supposed to question people's preferences.\"",
      "Professor McGonagall gave Harry a very strange\nlook.",
      "\"I mean,\" Harry said again, \"from what I've read, when I'm a bit\nolder there's something like a 10% chance that I'll find\nProfessor Snape attractive, and the important thing is for me to\njust accept whatever I -\"",
      "\"In any case, Mr. Potter, Severus has always been\nentirely indifferent to the stares of those young girls. But now -\"\nProfessor McGonagall seemed to realize something, and hastily said,\nher hands rising in warding, \"Please don't mistake me, Professor\nSnape certainly has not taken advantage of any young\nwitches! Absolutely not! He has never even so much as smiled at\none, not that I ever heard. He has told the young girls to stop\ngaping at him. And if they stare at him regardless, he looks away.\nThat I have seen with my own eyes.\"",
      "\"Er...\" Harry said. \"Sorry, but just because I've read\nthose books doesn't mean I understood them. What does all that\nmean?\u202f\"",
      "\"That he is noticing,\" Professor McGonagall said in a\nlow voice. \"It is a subtle thing, but now that I have seen it, I am\ncertain. And that means... I am very much afraid... that\nthe bond which held Severus to Albus's cause... may have weakened,\nor even broken.\"",
      "2 + 2 = ...",
      "\"Snape and Dumbledore?\u202f\" Then Harry heard the words\nthat had just come out of his mouth, and hastily added, \"Not that\nthere's anything wrong with that -\"",
      "\"No!\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Oh, for pity's sake -\nI can't explain it to you, Mr. Potter!\"",
      "The other shoe finally dropped.",
      "He was still in love with my mother?",
      "This seemed somewhere between beautifully sad, and pathetic, for\naround five seconds before the third shoe dropped.",
      "Of course, that was before I gave him my helpful\nrelationship advice.",
      "\"I see,\" Harry said carefully after a few moments. There were\ntimes when saying 'Oops' didn't fully cover it. \"You're right,\nthat's not a good sign.\"",
      "Professor McGonagall put both hands over her face. \"Whatever\nyou're thinking right now,\" she said in a slightly muffled voice,\n\"which I assure you is also wrong, I don't want to hear\nabout it, ever.\"",
      "\"So...\" Harry said. \"If, like you said, the bond that held\nProfessor Snape to the Headmaster has broken... what would\nhe do then?\"",
      "There was a long silence.",
      "What would he do then?",
      "Minerva lowered her hands, gazing down at the upturned face of\nthe Boy-Who-Lived. One simple question shouldn't have caused her so\nmuch dismay. She'd known Severus for years; the two of them bound,\nin some strange way, by the prophecy they'd both heard. Though\nMinerva suspected, from what she knew of the rules of prophecy,\nthat she had only overheard it herself. It had been\nSeverus's acts which had brought about the prophecy's fulfillment.\nAnd the guilt, the heartbreak which had come of that choice, had\nbeen tormenting the Potions Master for years. She couldn't imagine\nwho Severus would be without it. Her mind went blank, trying to\nimagine; her thoughts an empty parchment.",
      "Surely Severus was no longer the man he'd once been,\nthat angry and terribly foolish young man who'd brought the\nprophecy before Voldemort in exchange for being admitted into the\nDeath Eaters. She'd known him for years, and surely Severus was no\nlonger that man...",
      "Did she really know him at all?",
      "Had anyone ever seen the real Severus Snape?",
      "\"I don't know,\" Professor McGonagall finally said. \"I truly\ndon't know at all. I can't even imagine. Do you know\nanything of this, Mr. Potter?\"",
      "\"Er...\" Harry said. \"I think I can say that my own evidence\npoints in the same direction as yours. I mean, it increases the\nprobability that Professor Snape isn't in love with my mother\nanymore.\"",
      "Professor McGonagall closed her eyes. \"I give up.\"",
      "\"I don't know of anything wrong he's done apart from that,\nthough,\" Harry added. \"I assume the Headmaster cleared you to ask\nme about this?\"",
      "Professor McGonagall looked away from him, staring at the wall.\n\"Please don't, Harry.\"",
      "\"All right,\" Harry said, and turned and hurried out into the\nhallways, hearing Professor McGonagall more slowly walking after,\nand the rumbling sound of the gargoyles moving into place.",
      "It was the morning after next, during Potions class, that\nHarry's potion of cold resistance boiled over his cauldron\nwith a green froth and mildly nauseating smell, and Professor\nSnape, looking more resigned than disgusted, told Harry to stay\nafter class. Harry had his own suspicions about this affair, and as\nsoon as class let out - Hermione, as usual for the last few days,\nbeing the first to flee out the door - the door swung shut and\nlocked behind the departing students.",
      "\"I apologize for ruining your potion, Mr. Potter,\" Severus Snape\nsaid quietly. There was upon his face the strange sad look that\nHarry had seen only once before, in a hallway some time ago. \"It\nwill not be reflected in your grades. Please, sit down.\"",
      "Harry sat back down at his desk, filling up the time by\nscrubbing a bit more at the green stain on the wooden surface, as\nthe Potions Master incanted a few privacy spells.",
      "When the Potions Master was done, he spoke again. \"I... do not\nknow how to broach this topic, Mr. Potter, so I will simply say\nit... before the Dementor, you recovered your memory of the night\nyour parents died?\"",
      "Harry silently nodded.",
      "\"If... I know it must not be a pleasant memory, but... if you\ncould tell me what happened...?\"",
      "\"Why?\" Harry said. His voice was solemn, definitely not\nmocking the pleading look that Harry had never expected to see\nfrom that person. \"I wouldn't think that would be a pleasant thing\nfor you to hear either, Professor -\"",
      "The Potions Master's voice was almost a whisper. \"I have\nimagined it every night these last ten years.\"",
      "You know, said Harry's Slytherin side, it might not\nbe such a good idea to give him closure, if his guilt-based\nloyalties are already wavering -",
      "Shut up. Overruled.",
      "It wasn't something that Harry could actually bring\nhimself to deny. He took one suggestion from his Slytherin side,\nand that was it.",
      "\"Will you tell me exactly how you came to learn about\nthe Prophecy?\" Harry said. \"I'm sorry to make this a trade, I\nwill tell you afterward, only, it could be really\nimportant -\"",
      "\"There is little to say. I had come to be interviewed by the\nDeputy Headmistress for the position of Potions Master, and so I\nwas waiting outside the room of the Hog's Head Inn when the\napplicant before me, Sybill Trelawney, came to seek the position of\nProfessor of Divination. As soon as Trelawney finished speaking her\nwords, I fled, forsaking my chance at Hogwarts's Mastery, and went\nto the Dark Lord.\" The Potions Master's face was drawn and tight.\n\"I did not even pause to consider why that riddle might have come\nto me, before I sold it to another.\"",
      "\"A job interview?\u202f\" Harry said. \"Where you and\nProfessor Trelawney both happened to be applying, and Professor\nMcGonagall was interviewing? That seems... like rather a large\ncoincidence...\"",
      "\"Seers are the pawns of time, Mr. Potter. Coincidence is beneath\nthem, and they are above it. I was the one meant to hear that\nprophecy and become its fool. Minerva's presence made no final\ndifference to how it came about. There was no Memory Charm as you\nsupposed, I do not know why you thought that, but there was no\nMemory-Charm, there could have been no Memory-Charm. The voice of a\nseer has a quality, an enigma which even Legilimency cannot share,\nhow could that be imbued in a false memory? Do you think the Dark\nLord would believe my mere words? The Dark Lord seized my mind and\nsaw the mystification there, even if he could not seize the\nmystery, and so he knew the prophecy had been true. The Dark Lord\ncould have killed me then, having taken what he wanted - I was a\nfool indeed to go to him - but he saw something in me I do not\nknow, and took me into the Death Eaters, though on his terms rather\nthan mine. That is how I brought it about, brought it all about,\nfrom beginning to end, always my own doing.\" Severus's voice had\ngone rather hoarse, and his face was filled with naked pain. \"Now\ntell me, please, how did Lily die?\"",
      "Harry swallowed twice, and began his recounting.",
      "\"James Potter shouted for Lily to run away with me, that he\nwould hold off You-Know-Who.\"",
      "\"You-Know-Who said -\" Harry stopped, the chills going all over\nhis own skin, his own muscles tightening as if in preparing for a\nseizure. The memory was returning strongly, now, accompanied by\ncold and darkness in association. \"He used... the Killing Curse...\nand then he came upstairs somehow, I think he must have flown, I\ndon't remember any footsteps on stairs or anything like that... and\nthen my mother said, 'No, not Harry, please not Harry!' or\nsomething like that. And the Dark Lord - his voice was so high,\nlike water whistling out of a teakettle only cold - the\nDark Lord said -\"",
      "Stand aside, woman! For you I am not come, only the\nboy.",
      "The words were very clear in Harry's memory.",
      "\"- he told my mother to get out of his way, that he was only\nthere for me, and my mother begged him to have mercy, and\nthe Dark Lord said -\"",
      "I give you this rare chance to flee.",
      "\"- that he was being generous and giving her a chance to run,\nbut he wouldn't bother fighting her, and even if she died, she\ncouldn't save me -\" Harry's voice was unsteady, \"- and so she ought\nto get out of his way. And that was when my mother begged the Dark\nLord to take her life instead of mine - and the Dark Lord - the\nDark Lord said to her - and his voice was lower this time, like he\nwas dropping a pose -\"",
      "Very well, I accept the bargain.",
      "\"- he said that he accepted her offer, and that she should drop\nher wand so he could kill her. And then the Dark Lord waited, just\nwaited. I, I don't know what Lily Potter was thinking, it hadn't\neven made sense in the first place, what she said, it wasn't like\nthe Dark Lord would kill her and then just leave, when\nhe'd come there for me. Lily Potter didn't say anything, and then\nthe Dark Lord started laughing at her and it was horrible and - and\nshe finally tried the only thing left that wasn't abandoning me or\njust giving up and dying. I don't know if she even could've, if the\nspell would've worked for her, but when you think about, she had to\ntry. The last thing my mother said was 'Avada Ke-' but the Dark\nLord started his own curse as soon as she said 'Av' and he said it\nin less than half a second and there was a flash of green light and\nthen - and then - and then -\"",
      "\"That's enough.\"",
      "Slowly, like a body floating to the surface of water, Harry\nreturned from wherever he'd been.",
      "\"That's enough,\" the Potions Master said hoarsely. \"She died...\nLily died without pain, then? The Dark Lord... did not do anything\nto her, before she died?\"",
      "She died thinking that she'd failed, and that the Dark Lord\nwas going to kill her baby next. That's pain.",
      "\"He - the Dark Lord didn't torture her -\" Harry said. \"If that's\nwhat you're asking.\"",
      "Behind Harry, the door unlocked itself and swung open.",
      "Harry left.",
      "It was Friday, April 10th, of 1992."

      "Thursday, April 16th, 1992.",
      "The school was almost deserted now, nine-tenths of the students\nhaving gone home for the Easter holiday, just about everyone she\nknew missing. Susan had stayed behind, her grand-aunt being quite\nbusy, as had Ron for reasons she didn't know - maybe the Weasley\nfamily was poor enough that feeding all the children for an extra\nweek would've been a noticeable strain? It all worked out well\nenough, since Ron and Susan were just about the only ones left\nwho'd still talk to her. (At least that she wanted to talk back\nto. Lavender was still nice to her, and Tracey was, um,\nTracey, but neither of them were quite relaxing to spend a\nfree hour around; and in any case, neither of those two had stayed\nover for the Easter hols.)",
      "If she couldn't go home - and she wasn't allowed to go\nhome, her parents had been lied-to and told she'd had Glowpox -\nthen an almost-empty Hogwarts was the next best thing.",
      "She could even visit the library without people staring at her,\nsince there were no lessons and nobody was trying to do\nschoolwork.",
      "It would be a mistake to think that Hermione drooped about the\ncorridors weeping all day long. Oh, she'd cried a lot the first two\ndays, of course, but two days had been enough. There were parts of\nHarry's borrowed books about that, how even people who were\nparalyzed in car accidents weren't nearly as unhappy as they'd\nexpected to be, six months later, just like lottery winners weren't\nnearly as happy as they'd expected. People adjusted, their\nhappiness levels went back to their happiness set point, life went\non.",
      "A shadow fell over where Hermione was reading her current book\nand she whirled around, the wand hidden on her lap coming up to\npoint directly at the surprised face of -",
      "\"Sorry!\" Harry Potter said, hastily holding up his palms to show\nhis left hand empty, and his right hand holding a small red-velvet\npouch. \"Sorry. Didn't mean to startle you.\"",
      "There was an awful silence, her heartbeat increasing and her\npalms starting to sweat as Harry Potter just looked at her. She'd\nalmost talked to him, on the first morning of the rest of\nher life; but when she'd come down to breakfast Harry Potter had\nlooked so awful - so she hadn't sat down beside him at the\nbreakfast-table, just quietly eaten in her own little bubble of\nnobody else sitting next to her, and it had been horrible, but\nHarry hadn't come to her, and... she just hadn't talked to him,\nsince then. (It wasn't hard to avoid everyone, if you stayed out of\nthe Ravenclaw common room, and ran out of classes before anyone\ncould talk to you.)",
      "And ever since she'd been wondering what Harry thought of her\nnow - if he hated her for having lost all his money - or if he\nreally was in love with her and that's why he'd done it -\nor if he'd given up on her keeping pace with him because\nshe couldn't frighten Dementors - she couldn't\nface him now, she just couldn't, she spent sleepless nights\nworrying what Harry thought of her now, and she was afraid, and\nshe'd been avoiding the boy who'd spent all his money to save her,\nand she was a horrible ungrateful wretch, and a terrible person and\n-",
      "Then her eyes glanced down to see that Harry was reaching into\nthe red-velvet pouch and taking out a heart-shaped red-foil-wrapped\nsweet, and her brain melted down like chocolate left out in the\nsun.",
      "\"I was going to give you more space,\" said Harry Potter, \"only I\nwas reading up on Critch's theories about hedonics and how to train\nyour inner pigeon and how small immediate positive and negative\nfeedbacks secretly control most of what we actually do, and it\noccurred to me that you might be avoiding me because seeing me made\nyou think of things that felt like negative associations, and I\nreally didn't want to let that run any longer without\ndoing something about it, so I got ahold of a bag of chocolates\nfrom the Weasley twins and I'm just going to give you one every\ntime you see me as a positive reinforcement if that's all right\nwith you -\"",
      "\"Breathe, Harry,\" Hermione said without thinking about\nit.",
      "It was the first word she'd spoken to him since the day of the\ntrial.",
      "The two of them stared at each other.",
      "The books stared at them from the surrounding shelves.",
      "They stared some more at each other.",
      "\"You're supposed to eat the chocolate,\" Harry said, holding out\nthe heart-shaped sweet like a Valentine. \"Unless just being given a\nchocolate feels good enough to count as a positive reinforcement,\nin which case you probably need to put it in your pocket or\nsomething.\"",
      "She knew that if she tried speaking again she'd fail, so she\ndidn't try.",
      "Harry's head slumped a bit. \"Do you hate me now?\"",
      "\"No!\u202f\" she said. \"No, you shouldn't think that, Harry!\nJust - just - just everything!\u202f\" She realized that her\nwand was still pointed at Harry, and she lowered it. She was trying\nvery hard not to burst out into tears. \"Everything!\u202f\" she\nrepeated, and couldn't find any better to say than that, although\nshe was certain that Harry wanted to tell her to be specific.",
      "\"I think I understand,\" Harry said cautiously. \"What're you\nreading?\"",
      "Before she could stop him, them, Harry bent over the\nlibrary-desk to see the book she was reading, leaning his head\nforward before she could think to grab the book away -",
      "Harry stared at the open page.",
      "\"The World's Wealthiest Wizards and How They Got That Way,\"\nHarry read off the book's title from the top. \"Number sixty-five,\nSir Gareth, owner of a transportation company that won the\n19th-century shipping wars... monopoly on oh-tee-threes... I\nsee.\"",
      "\"I s'pose you're going to tell me that I don't need to worry\nabout anything and you'll take care of it all?\" It came out\nsounding harsher than she would've wanted, and she felt another\nstab of guilt for being such a terrible person.",
      "\"Nah,\" Harry said, sounding oddly cheerful. \"I can put myself in\nyour shoes well enough to know that if you paid a bunch of\nmoney to save me, I'd be trying to pay it back. I'd know\nit was silly on some level, and I'd still be trying to pay\nit back all by myself. There's no way I wouldn't understand\nthat, Hermione.\"",
      "Hermione's face screwed up and she felt moisture in the corners\nof her eyes.",
      "\"Fair warning, though,\" Harry went on, \"I might solve the debt\nto Lucius Malfoy myself if I see a way before you do, it's more\nimportant to get that sorted immediately than which one of\nus gets it sorted. Anything interesting so far?\"",
      "Three-quarters of her was running in circles and smashing into\ntrees as she tried to figure out the implications of everything\nHarry had just said (did he still respect her as a\nheroine? or did that mean he thought she couldn't do it on\nher own?) and meanwhile a much more sensible part of Hermione\nflipped back the book to page 37 which had the most promising entry\nshe'd seen so far (though in her imagination she always did it on\nher own and took Harry completely by surprise) -",
      "\"I thought this seemed quite interesting,\" her voice said.",
      "\"Number fourteen, 'Crozier', true name unknown,\" Harry read.\n\"Wow, that is... that is the gaudiest checkered top hat I've ever\nseen. Wealth, at least six hundred thousand Galleons... so around\nthirty million pounds, not enough to make a Muggle famous, but good\nenough for the smaller wizard population, I guess. Rumored to be a\nmodern alias of the six-century-old Nicholas Flamel, the only known\nwizard to succeed at the incredibly difficult alchemical procedure\nfor creating the Philosopher's Stone, which enables the\ntransmutation of base metals into gold or silver as well as... the\nElixir of Life which indefinitely prolongs the youth and health of\nthe user... Um, Hermione, this seems obviously false.\"",
      "\"I've read more references to Nicholas Flamel,\" Hermione said.\n\"The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts says he secretly\ntrained Dumbledore to stand up to Grindelwald. There's a lot of\nbooks that take the story seriously, not just this one... you think\nit's too good to be true?\"",
      "\"No, of course not,\" said Harry. Harry pulled out the chair next\nto her own, at the small table, and sat down beside her in his\naccustomed place on her right, just like he'd never left; she had\nto choke back a catch in her throat. \"The idea of 'too good to be\ntrue' isn't causal reasoning, the universe doesn't check if the\noutput of the equations is 'too good' or 'too bad' before allowing\nit. People used to think that airplanes and smallpox vaccines were\ntoo good to be true. Muggles have figured out ways to travel to\nother stars without even using magic, and you and I can use our\nwands to do things that Muggle physicists think are literally\nimpossible. I can't even imagine what we could rule out the\nreal laws of magic being able to do.\"",
      "\"So what's the problem, then?\" Hermione said. Her voice sounded\nmore normal now, in her own ears.",
      "\"Well...\" Harry said. The boy reached over her own outstretched\narm, his robes brushing hers, and tapped the artist's illustration\nof an ominously glowing red stone dripping scarlet liquid. \"Problem\none is that there's no logical reason why the same\nartifact would be able to transmute lead to gold and\nproduce an elixir that kept someone young. I wonder if there's an\nofficial name for that in the literature? Like the 'turned up to\neleven effect', maybe? If everyone can see a flower, you can't get\naway with saying flowers are the size of houses. But if you're in a\nflying saucer cult, since nobody can see the alien mothership\nanyway, you can say it's the size of a city, or the size of the\nMoon. Observable things have to be constrained by evidence, but\nwhen somebody makes up a story, they can make the story as extreme\nas they want. So the Philosopher's Stone gives you unlimited gold\nand eternal life, not because there's a single magical\ndiscovery that would produce both of those effects, but because\nsomeone made up a story about a super happy thingy.\"",
      "\"Harry, there's a lot of things in magic that aren't sensible,\"\nshe said.",
      "\"Granted,\" said Harry. \"But Hermione, problem two is that not\neven wizards are crazy enough to casually overlook the\nimplications of this. Everyone would be trying to\nrediscover the formula for the Philosopher's Stone, whole\ncountries would be trying to capture the immortal wizard\nand get the secret out of him -\"",
      "\"It's not a secret.\" Hermione flipped the page, showing\nHarry the diagrams. \"The instructions are right on the next page.\nIt's just so difficult that only Nicholas Flamel's done\nit.\"",
      "\"So entire countries would be trying to kidnap Flamel and force\nhim to make more Stones. Come on, Hermione, even wizards\nwouldn't hear about immortality and, and,\" Harry Potter\npaused, his eloquence apparently failing him, \"and just keep\ngoing. Humans are crazy, but they're not that\ncrazy!\"",
      "\"Not everyone thinks the same way you do, Harry.\" He\ndid have a point, but... how many different references had\nshe come across to Nicholas Flamel? Besides World's Wealthiest\nWizards and Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts, there'd\nalso been Stories of Moderately Ancient Times and\nBiographies of the Justly Famous...",
      "\"All right then, Professor Quirrell would've kidnapped\nthis Flamel guy. It's what an evil person or a good person\nor just a selfish person would do if they had any sense.\nThe Defense Professor knows a lot of secrets and he wouldn't miss\nthat one.\" Harry sighed and looked up; she followed his\ngaze, but he was apparently just looking at the larger library, the\nrows and rows and rows of bookcases. \"I don't mean to mess with\nyour project,\" said Harry, \"and I certainly don't mean to\ndiscourage you, but... Honestly, Hermione, I'm not sure you're\ngoing to find any good ideas for making money in a book like this.\nLike the old joke about how if an economist sees a twenty-pound\nnote lying in the street, they won't bother picking it up, because\nif it were real, someone else would've picked it up already. Any\nway of making lots of money that everyone knows about to\nthe point where it's in books like this... you see what I'm saying?\nIt can't be possible for everyone to make a thousand Galleons a\nmonth in three easy steps, or everyone would be doing it.\"",
      "\"So? That wouldn't stop you,\" Hermione said, her voice\nnow roughening again. \"You do impossible things all the time, I bet\nyou've done something impossible in the last week and you\ndidn't bother telling anyone.\"",
      "(There was a slight pause, which, if Miss Granger had known, was\nexactly the length of pause you'd make if you'd fought Mad-Eye\nMoody and won exactly eight days earlier.)",
      "\"Not in the last seven days, no,\" Harry said. \"Look... part of\nthe trick of doing the impossible is being selective about\nwhich impossibilities you challenge, and only trying when\nyou have a special advantage. If there's a money-making method in\nthis book that sounds difficult for a wizard, but it's easy if we\ncan use Dad's old Mac Plus, then we'd have a plan.\"",
      "\"I know that, Harry,\" Hermione said, her voice wavering\nonly slightly. \"I was looking to see if there was anything here I\ncould figure out how to do. I thought, maybe the difficult\npart about making a Philosopher's Stone was that the alchemical\ncircle had to be super precise, and I could get it right by using a\nMuggle microscope -\"",
      "\"That's brilliant, Hermione!\" The boy rapidly drew his\nwand, said \"Quietus,\" and then continued after the small\nnoises of the rowdier books had died down. \"Even if the\nPhilosopher's Stone is just a myth, the same trick might work for\nother difficult alchemies -\"",
      "\"Well, it can't work,\" Hermione said. She'd flown\nacross the library to look up the only book on alchemy that wasn't\nin the Restricted Section. And then - she remembered the crushing\nletdown, all the sudden hope dissipating like mist. \"Because\nall alchemical circles have to be drawn 'to the fineness\nof a child's hair', it isn't any finer for some alchemies than\nothers. And wizards have Omnioculars, and I haven't heard\nof any spells where you use Omnioculars to magnify things and do\nthem exactly. I should've realized that!\"",
      "\"Hermione,\" Harry said seriously, as he started to dig down into\nthe red-velvet pouch again, \"don't punish yourself when a bright\nidea doesn't work out. You've got to go through a lot of\nflawed ideas to find one that might work. And if you send your\nbrain negative feedback by frowning when you think of a flawed\nidea, instead of realizing that idea-suggesting is good behavior by\nyour brain to be encouraged, pretty soon you won't think of any\nideas at all.\" Harry put down two heart-shaped chocolates beside\nthe book. \"Here, have another chocolate. Besides the one from\nearlier, I mean. This one is to reinforce your brain for generating\na good candidate strategy.\"",
      "\"I suppose you're right,\" Hermione said in a small voice, but\nshe didn't touch the chocolate. She started to turn the pages back\nto 167, where she'd been reading before Harry had come in.",
      "(Hermione Granger did not require bookmarks, of\ncourse.)",
      "Harry was leaning over slightly, his head almost touching her\nshoulder, watching the pages as she turned them, as though he might\nbe able to glean valuable information from glimpsing the page for\nonly a quarter-second. Breakfast hadn't been long ago, and she\ncould clearly identify, from the faint scent of his breath, that\nHarry'd eaten banana pudding for dessert.",
      "Harry spoke again. \"So with all that said... and please take\nthis as a positive reinforcement... did you really try to invent a\nway to mass-produce immortality so that I could pay\noff my debt to Lucius Malfoy?\u202f\"",
      "\"Yes,\" she said in an even smaller voice. Even when she\ntried to think like Harry, it seemed she hadn't yet got\nthe knack of it. \"So what've you been doing this whole time,\nHarry?\"",
      "Harry made a disgusted face. \"Trying to collect evidence on the\nwhole 'Who Framed Hermione Granger' mystery.\"",
      "\"I...\" Hermione looked up at Harry. \"Shouldn't I... be trying to\nsolve my own mystery, though?\" It hadn't been her first\nthought, her first priority, but now that Harry mentioned it...",
      "\"That wouldn't work in this case,\" Harry said soberly. \"There's\ntoo many people who'll talk to me and not you... and I'm also sorry\nto say that some of them made me promise not to talk to anyone\nelse. Sorry, I don't think you can help much on this one.\"",
      "\"Okay, I guess,\" Hermione said leadenly. \"Fine. You do\neverything. You gather all the clues and talk to all the suspects\nwhile I just sit here in the library. Let me know after it turns\nout that it was Professor Quirrell who did it.\"",
      "\"Hermione...\" Harry said. \"Why is it so important who\ndoes what? Shouldn't it be more important to get everything solved,\nthan who solves it?\"",
      "\"I guess you're right,\" Hermione said. She lifted her hands to\npress up at her eyes. \"I guess it doesn't matter any more.\nEveryone's going to think - I know it's not your fault,\nHarry, you were - you were being Good, you were a perfect gentleman\n- but no matter what I do now, they'll all think that I'm just -\nsomeone for you to rescue.\" She paused, and said, with her voice\nquivering, \"And maybe they're right, Harry.\"",
      "\"Whoa, whoa, hold on there a second -\"",
      "\"I can't scare Dementors. I can get Outstandings in Charms\nclass, but I can't scare Dementors.\"",
      "\"I've got a mysterious dark side!\u202f\" Harry hissed, after\nhis head turned around to scan the library. (There was one boy in a\ndistant corner, who did look in their direction occasionally, but\nhe would've been too far away to hear anything even without the\nQuieting Barrier.) \"I've got a dark side that definitely\nisn't a child, and who knows what other crazy magical stuff going\non in my head - Professor Quirrell claimed that I become whoever I\nbelieve I am - that's all cheating, don't you see,\nHermione? There's an arrangement that the school administration\nmade that I'm not supposed to talk about, so that the Boy-Who-Lived\ncould have more time to study every day, I'm cheating and\nyou're still beating me in Charms class. I'm - I'm\nprobably not - the Boy-Who-Lived probably isn't even something that\nyou could properly call a child - and you're still\ncompeting with that. Don't you realize, if it wasn't\nfor people paying attention to me, you'd look like the most\npowerful witch to come along in a century? When you can fight three\nolder bullies by yourself, and win?\"",
      "\"I don't know,\" she said, pressing her hands again over her\neyes, with her voice wavering. \"All I know is - even if that's all\ntrue - nobody's ever going to see me for myself anymore,\never.\"",
      "\"All right,\" Harry said after a while. \"I see what you mean.\nInstead of the famous Potter-and-Granger research team, there'll be\nHarry Potter and his lab assistant. Um... here's an idea. How about\nif I don't focus on making money for a while? I mean, the\ndebt doesn't come due until I graduate Hogwarts. So you can do it\nyourself and show the world you've still got it. And if you\ncoincidentally crack the secret of immortality along the way, we'll\njust call it a bonus.\"",
      "The thought of Harry relying on her to come up with a\nsolution seemed... like a crushing burden of responsibility to dump\non a poor traumatized twelve-year-old girl, and she wanted to hug\nhim for offering her a way to restore her self-respect as a\nheroine, and it was what she deserved for being a horrible\nperson and speaking sharply to Harry all the time, when all along\nhe'd been a truer friend to her than she'd ever been to him, and it\nwas good that he still thought she could do things, and...",
      "\"Is there some amazing rational thing you do when your mind's\nrunning in all different directions?\" she managed.",
      "\"My own approach is usually to identify the different desires,\ngive them names, conceive of them as separate individuals, and let\nthem argue it out inside my head. So far the main persistent ones\nare my Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Gryffindor, and Slytherin sides, my\nInner Critic, and my simulated copies of you, Neville, Draco,\nProfessor McGonagall, Professor Flitwick, Professor Quirrell, Dad,\nMum, Richard Feynman, and Douglas Hofstadter.\"",
      "Hermione considered trying this before her Common Sense warned\nthat it might be a dangerous sort of thing to pretend. \"There's a\ncopy of me inside your head?\"",
      "\"Of course there is!\" Harry said. The boy suddenly looked a bit\nmore vulnerable. \"You mean there isn't a copy of me living\nin your head?\"",
      "There was, she realized; and not only that, it talked\nin Harry's exact voice.",
      "\"It's rather unnerving now that I think about it,\" said\nHermione. \"I do have a copy of you living in my head. It's talking\nto me right now using your voice, arguing how this is perfectly\nnormal.\"",
      "\"Good,\" Harry said seriously. \"I mean, I don't see how people\ncould be friends without that.\"",
      "She continued reading her book, then, Harry seeming content to\nwatch the pages over her shoulder.",
      "She'd gotten all the way to number seventy, Katherine Scott,\nwho'd apparently invented a way to turn small animals into lemon\ntarts, when she finally worked up the courage to speak.",
      "\"Harry?\" she said. (She was leaning a bit away from him now,\nthough she didn't realize it.) \"If there's a copy of Draco Malfoy\nin your head, does that mean you're friends with Draco Malfoy?\"",
      "\"Well...\" Harry said. He sighed. \"Yeah, I'd been meaning to talk\nwith you about this anyway. I kind of wish I'd talked to you\nsooner. Anyway, how can I put this... I was corrupting him?\"",
      "\"What do you mean corrupting?\u202f\"",
      "\"Tempting him to the Light Side of the Force.\"",
      "Her mouth just stayed open.",
      "\"You know, like the Emperor and Darth Vader, only in\nreverse.\"",
      "\"Draco Malfoy,\" she said. \"Harry, do you have any\nidea -\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"- the sort of things Malfoy has been saying about me?\nWhat he said he'd do to me, as soon as he got the chance?\nI don't know what he told to you, but Daphne Greengrass\ntold me what Malfoy says when he's in Slytherin. It's\nunspeakable, Harry! It's unspeakable in the completely\nliteral sense that I can't say it out loud!\"",
      "\"When was this?\" Harry said. \"At the start of the year? Did\nDaphne say when this was?\"",
      "\"No,\" Hermione said. \"Because it doesn't matter when, Harry.\nAnyone who said things - like Malfoy said - they can't be a good\nperson. It doesn't matter what you tempted him to, he's still a\nrotten person, because no matter what a good person would\nnever -\"",
      "\"You're wrong.\" Harry said, looking her straight in the eyes. \"I\ncan guess what Draco threatened to do to you, because the second\ntime I met him, he talked about doing it to a ten-year-old girl.\nBut don't you see, on the day Draco Malfoy arrived in Hogwarts,\nhe'd spent his whole previous life being raised by Death\nEaters. It would've required a supernatural\nintervention for him to have your morality given\nhis environment -\"",
      "Hermione was shaking her head violently. \"No, Harry.\nNobody has to tell you that hurting people is wrong, it's\nnot something you don't do because the teacher says it's not\nallowed, it's something you don't do because - because you can\nsee when people are hurting, don't you know that, Harry?\"\nHer voice was shaking now. \"That's not - that's not a rule\npeople follow like the rules for algebra! If you can't see\nit, if you can't feel it here,\" her hand slapped down over\nthe center of her chest, not quite where her heart was located, but\nthat didn't matter because it was all really in the brain anyway,\n\"then you just don't have it!\"",
      "The thought came to her, then, that Harry might not\nhave it.",
      "\"There's history books you haven't read,\" Harry said quietly.\n\"There's books you haven't read yet, Hermione, and they might give\nyou a sense of perspective. A few centuries earlier - I think it\nwas definitely still around in the seventeenth century - it was a\npopular village entertainment to take a wicker basket, or a bundle,\nwith a dozen live cats in it, and -\"",
      "\"Stop,\" she said.",
      "\"- roast it over a bonfire. Just a regular celebration. Good\nclean fun. And I'll give them this, it was cleaner fun than burning\nwomen they thought were witches. Because the way people are built,\nHermione, the way people are built to feel inside -\" Harry\nput a hand over his own heart, in the anatomically correct\nposition, then paused and moved his hand up to point toward his\nhead at around the ear level, \"- is that they hurt when they see\ntheir friends hurting. Someone inside their circle of\nconcern, a member of their own tribe. That feeling has an\noff-switch, an off-switch labeled 'enemy' or 'foreigner' or\nsometimes just 'stranger'. That's how people are, if they don't\nlearn otherwise. So, no, it does not indicate\nthat Draco Malfoy was inhuman or even unusually evil, if he grew up\nbelieving that it was fun to hurt his enemies -\"",
      "\"If you believe that,\" she said with her voice\nunsteady, \"if you can believe that, then you're evil.\nPeople are always responsible for what they do. It doesn't matter\nwhat anyone tells you to do, you're the one who does it.\nEveryone knows that -\"",
      "\"No they don't! You grew up in a post-World-War-Two\nsociety where 'I vas only followink orders' is something\neveryone knows the bad guys said. In the fifteenth century\nthey would've called it honourable fealty.\" Harry's voice was\nrising. \"Do you think you're, you're just genetically\nbetter than everyone who lived back then? Like if you'd been\ntransported back to fifteenth-century London as a baby, you'd\nrealize all on your own that burning cats was wrong,\nwitch-burning was wrong, slavery was wrong, that every sentient\nbeing ought to be in your circle of concern? Do you think you'd\nfinish realizing all that by the first day you got to\nHogwarts? Nobody ever told Draco he was personally\nresponsible for becoming more ethical than the society he grew up\nin. And despite that, it only took him four months to get\nto the point where he'd grab a Muggleborn falling off a building.\"\nHarry's eyes were as fierce as she'd ever seen him. \"I'm not\nfinished corrupting Draco Malfoy, but I think he's\ndone pretty well so far.\"",
      "The problem with having such a good memory was that she\ndid remember.",
      "She remembered Draco Malfoy grabbing her wrist, so hard she'd\nhad a bruise afterward, while she was falling off the roof of\nHogwarts.",
      "She remembered Draco Malfoy helping her up, after that\nmysterious tripping jinx had sent her stumbling into the Slytherin\nQuidditch Captain's plate of food.",
      "And she remembered - it was, in fact, the reason she'd brought\nup the topic in the first place - how she'd felt when she'd heard\nDraco Malfoy's testimony under Veritaserum.",
      "\"Why didn't you tell me any of this?\" Hermione said,\nand despite herself, her voice rose in pitch. \"If I'd\nknown -\"",
      "\"It wasn't my secret to tell you,\" Harry said. \"Draco's the one\nwho would've been at risk, if his father had found out.\"",
      "\"I'm not stupid, Mr. Potter. What's the real reason you\ndidn't tell me, and what were you actually doing with Mr.\nMalfoy?\"",
      "\"Ah. Well...\" Harry broke eye contact with her, and looked down\nat the library table.",
      "\"Draco Malfoy told the Aurors under Veritaserum that he wanted\nto know if he could beat me, so he challenged me to a duel to\ntest it empirically. Those were his exact words\naccording to the transcript.\"",
      "\"Right,\" Harry said, still not meeting her eyes. \"Hermione\nGranger. Of course she'll remember the exact wording. It\ndoesn't matter if she's chained to her chair, on trial for murder\nin front of the entire Wizengamot -\"",
      "\"What were you really doing with Draco Malfoy?\"",
      "Harry winced, and said, \"Probably not quite what you're\nthinking, but...\"",
      "The horror scaled and scaled within her, and finally broke\nloose.",
      "\"You were doing SCIENCE with him?\u202f\"",
      "\"Well -\"",
      "\"You were doing SCIENCE with him? You were supposed to be\ndoing science with ME!\u202f\"",
      "\"It wasn't like that! It's not like I was doing real\nscience with him! I was just, you know, teaching him some\nharmless bits of Muggle science, like elementary physics with\nalgebra and so on - it's not like I was doing original magical\nresearch with him, the way I was with you -\"",
      "\"And I suppose you didn't tell him about me,\neither?\"",
      "\"Um, of course not?\" Harry said. \"I've been doing science with\nhim since October, and he wasn't exactly ready to hear about you\nthen -\"",
      "The inexpressible sense of betrayal inside her was welling and\nwelling, taking over everything, her rising voice, her glaring\neyes, her nose that she was certain was starting to run, the\nburning in her throat. She shoved herself up from the table and\ntook a step back, the better to look down on her betrayer, and her\nvoice was very nearly screeching as she yelled, \"That is not\nokay! You can't do science with two people at once!\u202f\"",
      "\"Er -\"",
      "\"I mean, you can't do science with two different people and\nnot tell them about each other!\u202f\"",
      "\"Ah...\" Harry said cautiously. \"I did think of that,\nand I was very careful not to get your research mixed together with\nanything I did with him -\"",
      "\"You were being careful.\" She would have\nhissed it, if it had contained any Ss.",
      "Harry raised a hand and rubbed at his messy hair, and somehow\nthat made her want to scream at him even more. \"Miss\nGranger,\" said Harry, \"I think this conversation has become\nmetaphorical on a level that's, um...\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" she screeched at him, at the top of her lungs\ninside their Quieting barrier.",
      "Then she realized and got so red that if she'd had an adult\nlevel of magical power her hair would have spontaneously caught on\nfire.",
      "The lone other patron in the library, the Ravenclaw boy sitting\nin the far opposite corner, was staring wide-eyed at both of them\nwhile making a rather sad attempt to conceal it by holding up a\nbook just below his face.",
      "\"Right,\" Harry said with a small sigh. \"So, keeping firmly\nin mind that it was just a bad metaphor, and that real\nscientists collaborate with each other all the time,\nI don't think that I was cheating. Scientists often keep quiet\nabout projects they're working on. You and I are doing research\nthat we're keeping secret, and there were reasons not to tell Draco\nMalfoy in particular - he wouldn't have stayed around me at all, in\nthe beginning, if he'd known I was your friend and not your rival.\nAnd Draco would've been the one at risk if I'd told anyone else\nabout him -\"",
      "\"Is that really all?\" she said. \"Really, Harry? You\ndidn't want both of us to feel special, like we were the\nonly ones you wanted to be with and the only ones\nwho got to be with you?\"",
      "\"That was not why I -\"",
      "Harry paused.",
      "Harry looked at her.",
      "All the blood was rushing back into her face, there probably\nshould've been steam coming out of her ears, which in turn\nshould've been melting off her head with the liquid flesh running\ndown into her neck, as she realized what she'd just blurted\nout.",
      "Harry was staring at her in dawning and complete terror.",
      "\"Well...\" she said in a rather high-pitched voice, \"it's... oh,\nI don't know, Harry! Is it just a metaphor? When a boy\nspends a hundred thousand Galleons to save a girl from certain\ndoom, she's entitled to wonder, don't you think? It's like being\nbought flowers, only, you see, rather more so -\"",
      "Harry shoved himself up from the table and took a staggering\nstep back, even as he brought up his arms to wave frantically.\n\"That's not why I did it! I did it because we're\nfriends!\u202f\"",
      "\"Just friends?\"",
      "Harry Potter's breathing was starting to scale up toward\nhyperventilation. \"Very good friends! Extra-special friends, even!\nBest friends forever, possibly! But not that kind of\nfriends!\"",
      "\"Is it really that awful to think about?\" she said with a catch\nin her voice. \"I mean - I'm not saying I'm in love with\nyou, but -\"",
      "\"Oh, you're not? Thank goodness.\" Harry brought up the\nsleeve of his robe and wiped across his forehead. \"Look, Hermione,\nplease don't misunderstand, I'm sure you're a wonderful person\n-\"",
      "She took a staggering step back.",
      "\"- but - even with my dark side -\"",
      "\"Is that what this is about?\" said Hermione. \"But I - I\nwouldn't -\"",
      "\"No, no, I mean, I have a mysterious dark side and probably\nother weird magic stuff going on, you know I'm not a\nnormal child, not really -\"",
      "\"It's okay to not be normal,\" she said, feeling increasingly\ndesperate and confused. \"I'm okay with it -\"",
      "\"But even with all that weird magical stuff letting me\nbe more adult than I should be, I haven't gone through puberty yet\nand there's no hormones in my bloodstream and my brain is\nphysically incapable of falling in love with anyone. So\nI'm not in love with you! I couldn't possibly be in love with you!\nFor all I know at this point, six months from now my brain is going\nto wake up and decide to fall in love with Professor Snape! Er, can\nI take it from this that you have been through\npuberty?\"",
      "\"Eep,\" said Hermione in a high-pitched sound. She swayed where\nshe stood, and a moment later Harry was rushing over to her side\nand helping lower her to sit on the ground, bracing her body with\nfirm hands.",
      "The fact was that she had staggered over to Professor\nMcGonagall's office back in December, not in total surprise because\nshe'd done her reading, but still rather queasily and it\nwas with great relief that she'd learned that witches had Charms to\ndeal with the inconveniences and what was Harry even doing\nasking a poor innocent girl a question like that -",
      "\"Look, I'm sorry,\" Harry said frantically. \"I really\ndidn't mean most of that the way it sounded! I'm sure that anyone\ntaking the outside view of the whole situation and offering betting\nodds on who I finally married would assign a higher probability to\nyou than anyone else I can think of -\"",
      "Her intelligence, which had barely been starting to pull itself\ntogether, promptly exploded into sparks and flame.",
      "\"- though not necessarily a probability higher than fifty\npercent, I mean, from the outside view there's a lot of other\npossibilities, and who I like before I hit puberty probably isn't\nall that strongly diagnostic of who I'll be with seven\nyears later - I don't want to sound like I'm promising\nanything -\"",
      "Her throat was making some sort of high-pitched sounds and she\nwasn't really listening to exactly what. All her universe had\nnarrowed to Harry's terrible, terrible voice.",
      "\"- and besides I've been reading about evolutionary psychology,\nand, well, there are all these suggestions that one man and one\nwoman living together happily ever afterward may be more the\nexception rather than the rule, and in hunter-gatherer tribes it\nwas more often just staying together for two or three years to\nraise a child during its most vulnerable stages - and, I mean,\nconsidering how many people end up horribly unhappy in traditional\nmarriages, it seems like it might be the sort of thing that needs\nsome clever reworking - especially if we actually do solve\nimmortality -\"",
      "Tano Wolfe, of fifth-year Ravenclaw, slowly stood up from his\nlibrary desk, from which vantage point he'd just watched Granger\nflee the library, sobbing. He hadn't been able to hear the\nargument, but it had clearly been one of those.",
      "Slowly and with his knees trembling, Tano approached the\nBoy-Who-Lived, who was staring in the direction of the library\ndoors, still vibrating from the force of how they'd been\nslammed.",
      "Tano didn't particularly want to do this, but Harry Potter\nhad been Sorted into Ravenclaw. The Boy-Who-Lived was,\ntechnically, his fellow Ravenclaw. And that meant there was a\nCode.",
      "The Boy-Who-Lived didn't say anything as Tano approached him,\nbut his gaze wasn't friendly.",
      "Tano swallowed, laid a hand on Harry Potter's shoulder, and\nrecited, his voice cracking only slightly, \"Witches! Go figure,\nhuh?\"",

      "A quick glance at the Head Table confirmed that the Divination\nProfessor was waving her wand frantically as the half-Giant dabbed\nat his clothes. Nobody else seemed to be paying much attention,\neven Professor McGonagall. Professor Flitwick was standing on his\nchair as usual, the Headmaster seemed to be absent again (he'd been\ngone most days of the holiday), Professors Sprout and Sinistra and\nVector were eating in their usual grouping, and -",

      "\"What does?\" said Fred or George.",

      "\"What sort of deep mysterious thoughts are you thinking?\" said a\nyoung-looking witch with short hair, sitting nearby. \"I mean, just\ncurious. I'm Brienne, by the way.\" She was gazing at him with one\nof those looks which Harry had firmly decided to just ignore until\nhe was older.",

      "The figure who'd just staggered into the Great Hall appeared to\nbe Mr. Filch, Hogwarts's token hallway monitor; who, along with his\npredatory cat Mrs. Norris, constituted a low-level random encounter\nwhom Harry often breezed past wearing his epic-level Deathly\nHallow. (Harry had once consulted the Weasley twins about pulling\nsome sort of prank on this deserving target, whereupon Fred or\nGeorge had quietly pointed out that Mr. Filch was never seen to use\na wand, which was odd, really, considering how many spells would be\nuseful in that position, and it made you wonder why Dumbledore had\ngiven the man a position at Hogwarts, and Harry had shut up.)",
      "Right now Mr. Filch's brown clothing was disarrayed and soaked\nwith sweat, his shoulders were visibly heaving as he breathed, and\nhis everpresent cat was missing.",

      "Minerva felt a stab of dismay in her other self, she hadn't\nliked the other cat very much but the two of them had still been\nfelines.",
      "An uproar started from the Great Hall. Severus stood up from the\nHead Table, somehow doing so without drawing any visible attention\nto himself, and strode out the huge doors without another word.",
      "Of course, Minerva thought, the third-floor\ncorridor - this could be a distraction -",
      "She mentally consigned all such matters to Severus's care, drew\nher wand, raised it high, and let out five sharp cracks of purple\nfire.",

      "Percy Weasley leaped up from the Gryffindor table. \"Follow me!\"\nhe said in a high voice. \"Stick together, first-years! No, not\nyou -\" but by that time the other prefects were raising\ntheir own voices as a renewed babble sprang up.",

Filius and Pomona had already risen\nto follow her, with Rubeus Hagrid towering over all of them as the\nhalf-giant stood up. She'd been through similar experiences too\nmany times, at this point. \"Sad experience has taught me that on\noccasions such as these, it is not a good time to take any advice\nthe current Defense Professor may offer. Indeed, I think it wise\nthat the two of us search for the troll together, so that no\nsuspicions may be cast upon you for any untoward events which occur\nduring that time.\"",
      "Without any hesitation, the Defense Professor swung smoothly on\nthe Gryffindor table and clapped his hands with a sound like a\nfloor cracking through.",
      "\"Michelle Morgan of House Gryffindor, second in command of\nPinnini's Army,\" the Defense Professor said calmly into the\nresulting quiet. \"Please advise your Head of House.\"",
      "Michelle Morgan climbed up onto her bench and spoke, the tiny\nwitch sounding far more confident than Minerva remembered her being\nat the start of the year. \"Students walking through the hallways\nwould be spread out and impossible to defend. All students are to\nremain in the Great Hall and form a cluster in the center...\nnot surrounded by tables, a troll would jump right over\ntables... with the perimeter defended by seventh-year students.\nFrom the armies only, no matter how good they are at\nduelling, so they don't get in each other's lines of\nfire.\" Michelle hesitated. \"I'm sorry, Mr. Hagrid, but - it\nwouldn't be safe for you, you should stay behind with the students.\nAnd Professor Trelawney shouldn't confront a troll on her own\neither,\" Michelle sounded much less apologetic about this part,\n\"but if she's paired with Professor Quirrell the two of them\ntogether can form an additional trusted and effective battle unit.\nThat concludes my analysis, Professor.\"",
      "\"Adequate, for being put on the spot,\" the Defense Professor\nsaid. \"Twenty Quirrell points to you. But you neglect the still\nsimpler point that home does not mean safe, and a\ntroll is strong enough to rip a portrait door off its hinges -\"",
      "\"Enough,\" Minerva snapped. \"Thank you, Miss Morgan.\" She looked\nto the watching tables. \"Students, you will do as she said.\" Turned\nback to the Head Table. \"Professor Trelawney, you will accompany\nthe Defense Professor -\"",
      "\"Ah,\" Sybill said falteringly. Beneath her overdone makeup and\nmess of shawls, the woman looked rather pale. \"I'm afraid - I'm not\nentirely well today - indeed, I feel rather faint -\"",
      "\"You won't have to fight the troll,\" Minerva said sharply, her\npatience taxed as usual when dealing with the woman. \"Just stay\nwith the Defense Professor and do not let him out of your sight for\nan instant, you must be able to testify afterward that you were\nwith him at all times.\" She turned to Rubeus. \"Rubeus, I\nam leaving you in charge here. Keep them safe.\" The huge man\nstraightened at this, losing his glum look and nodding proudly to\nher.",
      "Then Minerva looked at the students, and raised her voice. \"It\nshould go entirely without saying that anyone leaving the Great\nHall for any reason, will be expelled. No excuses will be\naccepted. Am I understood?\"",

      "- but Hermione now had an invisibility cloak and a broomstick in\nher pouch. Harry had insisted on that part for both her and\nNeville, and Professor McGonagall had told him it'd been done. That\nought to be enough to let Hermione get away, even if she was lousy\non a broomstick. All she had to do was get onto a section of roof,\nit was a clear day and sunlight was supposed to be bad for trolls\nsomehow, Harry remembered that part and therefore Hermione would\nremember it exactly.

Or if the troll ended up not\ngoing anywhere near her... like in the story of the boy who cried\nwolf, nobody would believe him the next time if she really was in\ntrouble; it could use up reputational credit that he would later\nneed for something else...",

There was\na huge indignant bellow, and unknown voices began to yell.",
      "Then Harry was through, his hand reaching into his pouch and his\nvoice was saying \"broomstick\", as behind him the great\ndoors began to swing shut again.",
      "Harry continued running through the Entrance Hall even as the\nlong three-person broomstick and its sets of stirrups began to\nprotrude from the pouch, repeating a number of swearwords in his\nhead and thinking this is what happens when you try to be\nsensible with the part of his mind that wasn't trying to\nfigure out a search pattern to cover places where Hermione might\nbe. The Library was on the third floor and practically on the other\nside of the castle... Harry had almost reached the great marble\nstaircase by the time the broomstick was in his hand and\n\"Up!\u202f\" he was in the air and accelerating up toward the\nsecond floor -",
      "\"Gah!\u202f\" Harry screamed, and barely managed to spin his\nbroom in the air so that he didn't impale one of the human figures\nlurking at the top of the stairs.

      "\"We can't figure out how to find her!\" one of the Weasley twins\nblurted, hands twisting in distress. \"We snuck out because we\nthought we could find Miss Granger - there has to be a\nquick way to find anyone inside the Hogwarts castle, we're both\nsure of it - but we can't figure out what it is!\"",
      "Harry stared at both of them, from where he was hanging upside\ndown from the broomstick where his desperate maneuver had brought\nhim, and entirely by reflex his mouth said, \"Well, why\nwere you so sure you could find her?\"",
      "\"We don't know!\" cried the other Weasley twin.",
      "\"Have you been able to find people inside Hogwarts before?\"",
      "\"Yes! We -\" and the Weasley twin who was speaking\nstopped abruptly, both redheads staring off into the distance with\na blank expression.",
      "There was a thundering crash, as of two huge doors being shoved\nopen by someone very, very strong.",
      "Harry spun around in the air to present the two open\nstirrup-positions on the broomstick to the Weasley twins, he didn't\nsay anything, there was no reason for them to give away their\npositions if they didn't have to. Time seemed to move too slowly as\nthe Weasley twins scrambled into the stirrups, Harry's heart\nbeating hard despite his mental calculation that Mr. Hagrid,\nrunning, shouldn't reach even the foot of the stairway in time.\nThen the three of them were accelerating hard and away\ntoward the nearest corridor, the stone floor beneath them blurring\nand the walls seeming to make an audible whooshing sound (though\nthat was just the wind in their ears) as they went past; Harry\nremembered that he was riding a longer three-person broomstick\nbarely in time to slow down for the next turn.",
      "And now all the broomstick seats were occupied, but if they\nactually found Hermione then - Harry could put on the Cloak of\nInvisibility, that should hide him from the troll, and that would\nfree up a seat for Hermione -",
      "Harry ducked hard before a sudden archway took his head off.",
      "\"We found Jesse!\" the Weasley twin seated behind Harry blurted.\n\"I know we did! That time we needed to tell him that Filch was\nhunting for him!\"",
      "\"How?\" Harry said, most of his brain engaged in not dying in a\nhorrible air accident. He should have slowed down for safety, but\nthere was a tension rising in him, a sourceless dread. He\ncouldn't slow down, something terrible would happen if he\nslowed down...",
      "\"We -\" said the Weasley twin seated lower down. \"We can't\nremember!\"",
      "Another sharp turn taken at, Harry estimated, roughly 0.3% of\nthe speed of light, and they were going through a twisty curving\ncorridor that Harry always took to get from the Great Hall to the\nlibrary only it wasn't the shortest way if you were on\na broomstick, he should've taken the long straight West\nCorridor instead -",
      "The part of his brain that wasn't steering caught up with\nreality.",
      "\"Someone's been tampering with your minds!\" Harry yelled, as he\nweaved through the curving corridor so fast that the tail-end\nWeasley sometimes lightly smacked into the wall as the length of\nthe broomstick conflicted with Harry's maladapted air skills.",
      "\"What?\u202f\" cried Fred or George.",
      "\"Whoever got to Hermione messed with your minds too!\" It could\nbe an Obliviation, it could be a False Memory that hadn't been\nplanted right, but right now Harry couldn't think -",
      "The broomstick turned and shot upward beside a spiral staircase,\nall three of them flattened themselves against the broomstick so\nthey could make in through the gap in the ceiling that opened onto\nthe third floor, and then they were in front of the library, the\nbroomstick slowing to a halt with a shriek despite the lack of\nanything it could be friction-braking against. Harry shot the\nWeasley twins a quick glance to stay put, as he clambered\noff the broomstick to shove open the doors of the library,\ncontrolling his breathing as he shoved his head inside.",
      "Hermione Granger wasn't there.",
      "Madam Pince, who was eating a sandwich at her desk, looked up\nwith a sudden glare. \"Library's closed!\"",
      "\"Have you seen Hermione Granger?\" Harry said.",
      "\"I said the library's closed, boy! Lunch hours!\"",
      "\"This is extremely important. Have you seen Hermione Granger or\ndo you have any idea where she might be?\"",
      "\"No, now be off!\"",
      "\"Do you have any fast way of contacting Professor McGonagall in\nan emergency?\"",
      "\"Eh?\" said the librarian, startled. She rose up from behind her\ndesk. \"What is -\"",
      "\"Yes or no. Please answer immediately.\"",
      "\"Ah - there's the Floo -\"",
      "\"She's not in her office,\" Harry said. \"Do you have any other\nway of reaching her. Yes or no.\"",
      "\"Young man, I insist that you -\"",
      "Harry's brain flagged this as I'm talking to NPCs again\nand he spun on his heel and dashed back for the broomstick.",
      "\"Stop!\" cried Madam Pince, bursting too late from the doors as\nHarry and the Weasley twins shot off again, out of the librarian's\nsight. The pressure in Harry's mind still rising, like a physical\nhand squeezing his chest, he had to find Hermione and he\nhad no other notion of where she could be, unless it was the\nwitches' dorms in the Ravenclaw tower and that he couldn't enter.\nSearching all of Hogwarts bordered on a mathematical impossibility,\nthere probably was no continuous flight path that entered all the\nrooms at least once - why hadn't he thought to demand for\nHermione and Neville and him to be given a set of those neat little\nmirrors the Aurors used to communicate -",
      "The realization that he was being stupid hit Harry like\na blow to the stomach. He didn't need mirrors to send a message, he\nhadn't needed mirrors since January. Harry slowed the broomstick to\na halt in midair of a hallway, his wand already coming into his\nhand, the driving will to protect Hermione Granger rising\nto the front of his mind like a sun of silver fire and flowing down\nhis arm as he cried",
      "\"EXPECTO PATRONUM!\u202f\"",
      "and the blazing white humanoid burst into existence like a nova,\nthe Weasley twins' voices crying aloud in shock.",
      "\"Tell Hermione Granger - that there's a troll loose in Hogwarts\n- it could be hunting for her - she needs to get into direct\nsunlight, now!\"",
      "The silver figure turned as though it was departing, and then\nvanished.",
      "\"Merlin's underpants,\" breathed Fred or George.",
      "The silver outline blasted back into the world, and said in the\nstrange outside version of Harry's own voice, \"Hermione Granger\nsays,\" the blazing figure's voice became higher-pitched,\n\"AHHHHHHHHH!\u202f\"",
      "Time seemed to fracture, like everything was moving very quickly\nand slowly at the same time. A desperate impulse to accelerate the\nbroomstick, fly at its maximum speed, only Harry didn't know\nwhere -",
      "\"If you know where she is,\" Harry shouted to the blazing\nhumanoid figure, staring into it as though it were a sun, \"then\ntake me to her!\"",
      "The silver blaze moved and Harry accelerated after it, the\nWeasley twins giving out high-pitched shrieks behind him as he\nfired through the air like a cannonball, moving faster than sanity,\nhe didn't focus on the walls whizzing past him or how fast he was\nmoving, just followed the silver light through corridors and flying\nup staircases and blitzing through doors that Fred or George cried\ndesperate incantations to open and it was all still taking too\nmuch time, somewhere deep inside Harry felt like he was\nsinking through molasses as windows and portraits shot past.",
      "The broomstick screamed through a final turn that whacked one of\nthe Weasley twins against the wall not quite as hard as a Bludger\nwould hit, and then they followed the brilliant Patronus through an\nopen space in the ceilings, blasting up and upwards, rising past\none floor and then another in less than a breath.",
      "His Patronus slowed to a halt (Harry braking hard in response)\njust as they reached the level of a wide-open floor space that that\nspread out until it escaped the ceiling and turned into an outdoor\nterrace, a spread of tiled marble open to the air and sky -"

      "Harry's hands tore open the healer's kit from his pouch, grabbed\none of the self-tightening tourniquets, wrapped them around one\nragged tooth-marked stump, his hands briefly slipping in the blood,\nthey didn't tremble, there wasn't any allowance for his hands to\ntremble. As the tourniquet formed a complete loop it tightened hard\nand more blood came out, but then the bleeding stopped on that\nthigh-stump, and Harry turned to the other. Part of his mind was\nscreaming, screaming, screaming and even the part of him picking up\nthe other self-tightening tourniquet heard it, but that also wasn't\nallowed.",
      "The two Weasley twins were shouting spells, one after another in\nrapid-fire casting that would have had Harry unconscious in sixty\nseconds, sometimes the twins shouted two spells simultaneously in\nperfect coordination, but most of the spells were disrupting in\nharmless showers of sparks against the troll's skin. As the other\ntourniquet tightened itself in another pulse of blood, Harry looked\nup at a \"Diffindo!\" / \"Reducto!\u202f\" that made the troll's\nvulnerable eyes explode in twin showers of vitreous humor, but the\ntroll only bellowed once more, its eyes already reforming.",
      "\"Fire and acid!\u202f\" Harry shouted. \"Use fire or\nacid!\u202f\"",
      "\"Fuego!\" / \"Incendio!\" Harry heard, but he\nwasn't looking, he was reaching for the syringe of glowing orange\nliquid that was the oxygenating potion, pushing it into Hermione's\nneck at what Harry hoped was the carotid artery, to keep her brain\nalive even if her lungs or heart stopped, so long as her brain\nstayed intact everything else could be fixed, it had to be possible\nfor magic to fix it, it had to be possible for magic to fix it, it\nhad to be possible for magic to fix it, and Harry pushed the\nplunger of the syringe all the way down, creating a faint glow\nbeneath the pale skin of her neck. Harry then pushed down on her\nchest, where her heart should be, hard compressions that he hoped\nwas moving the oxygenated blood around to where it could reach her\nbrain, even if her heart might have stopped beating, he hadn't\nactually thought to check her pulse.",
      "Then Harry stared at the other things in his medical kit, his\nmind going blank as he tried to figure out what else of what was\nthere, if anything, he could use. The screaming in that distant\ncorner of his mind was getting louder, much louder, now that his\nhands had stopped their frantic motions. He was suddenly aware of\nthe liquid sensation where blood had soaked through his robes and\nthe knees of his pants.",
      "From behind Harry came the sound of another bellow from the\ntroll, and he heard one of the Weasley twins shout \"Deligitor\nprodeas!\" and then, \"HELP! Do something!\"",
      "Harry twisted his head back to look, and saw that one of the\nWeasley twins was somehow now wearing the Sorting Hat on his head,\nfacing off against the troll which held the huge stone club in both\nits hands, looking somewhat scorched now and with one or two\nsmoking scars across its arms, but still intact.",
      "And then the voice of the Hat bellowed in a voice so loud it\nseemed to shake the walls,",
      "\"GRYFFINDOR!\"",
      "A pulse of power burned the air, magic feeling almost tangible\neven to Harry's young senses, the troll jumped back a pace with a\nsnort of surprise. Fred or George, with a strange look on his face,\nswept the Hat off his head with a motion smooth as a magician's\ntrick, and reached in with one hand and drew forth a hilt whose\npommel was a glowing ruby, followed by a wide crossguard of\ngleaming white metal, and a blade as long as a tall child. As the\nsword was revealed the air seemed to fill with a silent scream of\nfury.",
      "Upon the blade was written in golden script, nihil\nsupernum.",
      "Then the Weasley twin raised the sword aloft as though the huge\nblade weighed nothing, and screamed and charged.",
      "Harry's lips opened to say something, some long sentence like,\nNo, stop, you have no idea how to use a sword but not even\na single syllable left his lips before the sword sliced off the\ntroll's right arm through the elbow, cutting through skin and flesh\nand bone like jelly; just as the already-swinging arc of the stone\nclub smashed into the charging Weasley twin and sent him flying\nthrough the air above the marble floor, over the gap out of which\nthey'd risen on the broomstick, until that Weasley hit the wall on\nthe opposite side and then collapsed into an unmoving heap.",
      "The bright sword vanished down into the opening in the floor,\nclattering distantly as it dropped.",
      "\"Fred!\u202f\" screamed George Weasley, and then\n\"VENTUS!\"",
      "An invisible blow caught the troll and hurled it sideways\nthrough the air.",
      "\"VENTUS!\u202f\"",
      "The troll was hit again, blown to the edge of the floor and the\ngap leading downwards.",
      "\"VENTUS!\"",
      "But the troll had reached down and grabbed at the floor, its\nremaining hand crunching through marble to gain a firm hold. The\nthird blow sent the troll's body over the gap; but the hand\nremained at the edge. And then the troll was pulling itself back up\nsingle-handedly, roaring.",
      "George Weasley staggered, almost falling, his hand dropping to\nhis side. \"Harry -\" the Weasley twin said in a strained voice, \"Run\n-\"",
      "The remaining Weasley twin took a step sideways, slumped against\nthe wall, and slid to the ground.",
      "Time was fractured in Harry's mind, the world around him seemed\nto move slowly, distorted, or perhaps it was his own mind twisting\nand folding. He should have been moving, doing something, but a\nstrange paralysis seemed to be stopping all his muscles, all his\nmotions. Without any time for words, thoughts came in flashes of\nconcepts: that if Harry ran away the troll would eat the Weasley\ntwins as well as Hermione, that if Bludgers didn't kill wizards\nthen Fred should still be alive, that the Weasley twins were more\npowerful spellcasters than him and they hadn't been able to hold\nback the troll, there was no time to Transfigure anything he didn't\nalready possess, the troll seemed too agile to be lured over the\nedge of the terrace to fall off the sides of the Hogwarts castle,\nsomeone had enchanted the troll against sunlight before using it as\na murder weapon and might also have strengthened it in other ways.\nAnd then a mental image of Hermione running from the troll, running\nfor sunlight, finally reaching the bright terrace with the troll\nhot on her heels, only to find that someone else had thought of\nthat possibility, too.",
      "The screaming horror in his mind was drowned out by another\nemotion.",
      "Harry stood up.",
      "On the other side of the room, the enemy had also risen, the\nunregenerating stump of one sword-cut arm still bloody.",
      "intent to kill",
      "The troll grasped its fallen club in its remaining hand, and\ngave a huge bellow, smashing the club into the floor and sending\nmarble chips flying.",
      "think purely of killing",
      "The troll began to lumber towards where George had fallen, a\nthin string of drool trailing from the side of its lips.",
      "grasp at any means to do so",
      "Harry took five strides forward, and the enemy gave another\nbellow and turned away from George, its eyes focusing squarely on\nhim.",
      "censors off, do not flinch",
      "The third most perfect killing machine in nature bounded towards\nhim in leaping steps.",
      "KILL",
      "Harry's left hand already held the Transfigured diamond from his\nring, his right hand already held his wand.",
      "\"Wingardium Leviosa.\"",
      "Harry's wand directed the tiny jewel into the troll's mouth.",
      "\"Finite Incantatem.\"",
      "The troll's head blew off its spine as the rock expanded back\ninto its old form, and Harry stepped aside as the Enemy's body\ncrashed where he'd been standing.",
      "The enemy's head was already beginning to regenerate, the ragged\nstump of the jaw and spine smoothing over, the mouth completing\nitself and replacing its teeth.",
      "Harry bent down and picked up the troll's head by its left ear.\nHis wand jammed through the troll's left eye, plunging through the\njelly-like material and passing through the wide socket in the\nbone. Harry visualized a one-millimeter-wide cross-section through\nthe enemy's brain, and Transfigured it into sulfuric acid.",
      "The enemy stopped regenerating.",
      "Harry threw the corpse over the edge of the terrace and turned\nback to Hermione.",
      "Her eyes were moving, and focused on him.",
      "Harry scrambled down beside her, ignoring the blood soaking more\nof his already-soaked robes. You'll be all right, his\nbrain formed the sentence, but his lips wouldn't move. You'll\nbe all right, we'll find some magic to fix all this, put you back\nto normal, just hold on, don't -",
      "Hermione's lips were moving, just a tiny bit but they were\nmoving.",
      "\"your... fault...\"",
      "Time froze. Harry should have told her not to talk, to save her\nbreath, only he couldn't unblock his lips.",
      "Hermione drew in another breath, and her lips whispered, \"Not\nyour fault.\"",
      "Then she exhaled, and closed her eyes.",
      "Harry stared at her with his mouth half-open, his breath caught\nin his throat.",
      "\"Don't do this,\" said his voice. He'd only been two minutes\nlate.",
      "Hermione suddenly convulsed, her arms twitching into the air as\nthough reaching up for something, and her eyes flew open again.\nThere was a burst of something that was magic and also\nmore, a shout louder than an earthquake and containing a thousand\nbooks, a thousand libraries, all spoken in a single cry that was\nHermione; too vast to be understood, except that Harry suddenly\nknew that Hermione had whited out the pain, and was glad not to be\ndying alone. For a moment it seemed like the outpouring of magic\nmight hold, take root in the castle's stone; but then the\noutpouring ended and the magic faded, her body stopped moving and\nall motion halted as Hermione Jean Granger ceased to exist -",
      "No.",
      "Harry stood up from the body, swaying.",
      "No.",
      "There was a burst of flame and Dumbledore was standing there\nwith Fawkes, his eyes filled with horror. \"I felt a student die!\nWhat -\"",
      "The old wizard's eyes saw what lay upon the ground.",
      "\"Oh, no,\" whispered Albus Dumbledore. Fawkes gave a sad,\nmournful croon.",
      "\"Bring her back.\"",
      "There was silence on the terrace. Fred Weasley had risen up into\nthe air at a gesture from Dumbledore's wand and was floating\ntowards them, surrounded by a reassuring pink glow.",
      "\"Harry -\" the old wizard began. His voice cracked. \"Harry -\"",
      "\"Have Fawkes cry on her or whatever. Hurry up.\" The voice that\nspoke sounded perfectly calm.",
      "\"I, I can't, Harry, it's too late, she's dead -\"",
      "\"I don't want to hear about it. If it was me lying there, you'd\npull some kind of amazing rabbit out of your hat and save me,\nright, because the hero isn't allowed to die before the story's\nover. Well, she's the hero too, so whatever you were saving for\nthat extra-special occasion, just go ahead and use it now. I\npromise I'll pay you back.\"",
      "\"There isn't anything I can do! Her soul has departed, she's\npassed on!\"",
      "Harry opened his mouth to scream out all his fury, and then\nclosed it again. There wasn't any point in screaming, it wouldn't\naccomplish anything. The unbearable pressure rising inside him\ncouldn't be let out that way.",
      "Harry turned away from Dumbledore and looked down at where the\nremains of Hermione Granger were lying in a pool of blood. Part of\nhis mind was hammering at the world around him, trying to make it\ngo away, wake up from the nightmare and find himself back in his\nRavenclaw dorm room with the morning sun shining through the\ncurtains. But the blood remained and Harry didn't wake up, and\nanother part of him already knew that this event was real, part of\nthe same flawed world that included Azkaban and the Wizengamot\nchamber and",
      "No",
      "With a fracturing feeling, as though time was still torn to\npieces around him, Harry turned away from Dumbledore and looked\ndown at the remains of Hermione Granger lying in a pool of blood\nwith two tourniquets tied around her thigh-stumps, and decided",
      "No.",
      "I do not accept this.",
      "There isn't any reason to accept it, not when there's magic\nin the world.",
      "Harry would learn whatever he had to learn, invent whatever he\nhad to invent, rip the knowledge of Salazar Slytherin from the Dark\nLord's mind, discover the secret of Atlantis, open any gates or\nbreak any seals necessary, find his way to the root of all magic\nand reprogram it.",
      "He would rip apart the foundations of reality itself to get\nHermione Granger back.",
      "\"The crisis is over,\" the Defense Professor said. \"You may\ndismount, Madam.\"",
      "Trelawney, who had been sitting behind him on the two-person\nbroomstick that had just blazed through Hogwarts burning directly\nthrough all the walls and floors in their way, hastily pulled\nherself off and then sat down hard on the floor, a pace away from\nthe red-glowing edges of a newly made gap in the wall. The woman\nwas still breathing in gasps, bending over herself as though she\nwere on the verge of vomiting out something larger than she\nwas.",
      "The Defense Professor had felt the boy's horror, through the\nlink that existed between the two of them, the resonance in their\nmagic; and he had realized that the boy had sought the troll and\nfound it. The Defense Professor had tried to send an impulse to\nretreat, to don the Cloak of Invisibility and flee; but he'd never\nbeen able to influence the boy through the resonance, and hadn't\nsucceeded that time either.",
      "He'd felt the boy give himself over fully to the killing\nintention. That was when the Defense Professor had begun burning\nthrough the substance of Hogwarts, trying to reach the battle in\ntime.",
      "He'd felt the boy exterminate his enemy in seconds.",
      "He'd felt the boy's dismay as one of his friends died.",
      "He'd felt the fury the boy had directed at some annoyance who\nwas likely Dumbledore; followed by an unknown resolution whose\nunyielding hardness even he found adequate. With any luck, the boy\nhad just discarded his foolish little reluctances.",
      "Unseen by anyone, the Defense Professor's lips curved up in a\nthin smile. Despite its little ups and downs, on the whole this had\nbeen a surprisingly good day -",
      "\"HE IS HERE. THE ONE WHO WILL TEAR APART THE VERY\nSTARS IN HEAVEN. HE IS HERE. HE IS THE END OF THE\nWORLD.\""

      "A simple Innervate from the Headmaster had awakened\nFred Weasley, followed by a preliminary healing Charm for a broken\narm and cracked ribs. Harry's voice had distantly told the\nHeadmaster about the Transfigured acid inside the troll's head\n(Dumbledore had looked down over the side of the terrace and made a\ngesture before returning) and then about the Weasley twins' minds\nhaving been tampered with, carrying on a separate conversation that\nHarry remembered but could not process.",
      "Harry still stood over Hermione's body, he hadn't moved from\nthat spot, thinking as fast as he could through the sense of\ndissociation and fragmented time, was there anything he should be\ndoing now, any opportunities that were passing\nirrevocably. Some way to reduce the amount of magical omnipotence\nthat would be required later. A temporal beacon effect to mark this\ninstant for later time travel, if he someday found a way to travel\nback further than six hours. There were theories of time travel\nunder General Relativity (which had seemed much less plausible\nbefore Harry had run across Time-Turners) and those theories said\nyou couldn't go back to before the time machine was built - a\nrelativistic time machine maintained a continuous pathway through\ntime, it didn't teleport anything. But Harry didn't see anything\nhelpful he could do using spells in his lexicon, Dumbledore wasn't\nbeing very cooperative, and in any case this was several minutes\nafter the critical location within Time",
      "\"Harry,\" the Headmaster whispered, laying his hand on Harry's\nshoulder. He had vanished from where he was standing over the\nWeasley twins and come into existence beside Harry; George Weasley\nhad discontinously teleported from where he was sitting to be\nkneeling next to his brother's side, and Fred was now lying\nstraight with his eyes open and wincing as he breathed. \"Harry, you\nmust go from this place.\"",
      "\"Hold on,\" said Harry's voice. \"I'm trying to think if there's\nanything else I can do.\"",
      "The old wizard's voice sounded helpless. \"Harry - I know you do\nnot believe in souls - but whether Hermione is watching you now, or\nno, I do not think she would wish for you to be like this.\"",
      "...no, it was obvious.",
      "Harry leveled his wand at Hermione's body -",
      "\"Harry! What are you -\"",
      "- and poured everything down his arm into his hand\n-",
      "\"Frigideiro!\"",
      "\"- doing?\"",
      "\"Hypothermia,\" Harry said distantly, as he staggered. It'd been\none of the spells he and Hermione had experimented on, a lifetime\nago, so he was able to control it precisely, though it had taken a\nlot of power to affect that much mass. Hermione's body should now\nbe at almost exactly five degrees Celsius. \"People have been\nrevived from cold water after more than thirty minutes without\nbreathing. The cold protects you from brain damage, you see, it\nslows everything down. There's a saying Muggle doctors have, you're\nnot dead until you're warm and dead - I think they even cool down\nthe patient during some surgeries, if they have to stop someone's\nheart for a while.\"",
      "Fred and George started sobbing.",
      "Dumbledore's face was already streaked with tears. \"I'm sorry,\"\nhe whispered. \"Harry, I'm so sorry, but you have to stop this.\" The\nHeadmaster took Harry by the shoulders and pulled on him.",
      "Harry allowed himself to be turned away from Hermione's body,\nwalked forward as the Headmaster pushed him away from the blood.\nThe Cooling Charm would buy him time. Hours at least, maybe days if\nhe could manage to keep casting the spell on Hermione or if they\nstored her body somewhere cold.",
      "Now there was time to think.",
      "Minerva had seen Albus's face and she'd known something was\nwrong; there had been time for her to wonder what had happened, and\neven who had died; her mind flashing to Alastor, to Augusta, to\nArthur and Molly, all the most likely targets at the start of\nVoldemort's second rise. She had thought that she had steeled\nherself, she had thought herself ready for the worst.",
      "Then Albus spoke, and all the steel left her.",
      "Not Hermione - no -",
      "Albus gave her a brief space to weep; and then told her that\nHarry Potter, who had watched Miss Granger die, had seated himself\noutside the infirmary storeroom where Miss Granger's remains were\nbeing kept, refusing to move from the spot, and telling anyone who\nspoke to him to go away so he could think.",
      "The only thing that had elicited any reaction from the boy was\nwhen Fawkes had tried to sing to him; Harry Potter had shrieked at\nthe phoenix not to do that, his feelings were real, he didn't want\nmagic trying to heal them like they were a disease. After\nthat Fawkes had refused to sing again.",
      "Albus thought that she might have the best chance of reaching\nHarry Potter now.",
      "So she had to pull herself together, and clean up her face;\nthere would be time later for private grief, when her surviving\nchildren no longer needed her.",
      "Minerva McGonagall pulled together the dislocated pieces of\nherself, wiped her eyes a final time, and laid her hand on the\ndoorknob of the infirmary section whose back storeroom was now\nbeing used, for the second time this century and for the fifth time\nsince the castle of Hogwarts had been raised, as the resting place\nof a promising young student.",
      "She opened the door.",
      "Harry Potter's eyes gazed at her. The boy was sitting on the\nfloor in front of the door to the back storeroom, and holding his\nwand in his lap. If those eyes were grieving, if they were empty,\nif they were even broken, it couldn't be seen from looking at the\nboy's face. There were no dried tears on those cheeks.",
      "\"Why are you here, Professor McGonagall?\" Harry Potter said. \"I\ntold the Headmaster I'd like to be left alone for a while.\"",
      "She couldn't think of anything to say. To help you - you're\nnot all right - but she didn't know what to say, there was\nnothing she could imagine saying that would make things better. She\nhadn't planned ahead before she'd walked into the room, having not\nbeen at her best.",
      "\"What are you thinking about?\" Minerva said. It was the only\nsentence that came into her mind. Albus had told her that Harry had\nbeen saying, over and over, that he was thinking; and she had to\nget Harry talking, somehow.",
      "Harry stared half at her and half past her, a tension coming\ninto his face, as she held her breath.",
      "It took a while before Harry spoke.",
      "\"I'm trying to think if there's anything I should be doing right\nnow,\" said Harry Potter. \"It's hard, though. My mind keeps on\nimagining ways the past could have gone differently if I'd thought\nfaster, and I can't rule out that there might be a key insight in\nthere somewhere.\"",
      "\"Mr. Potter -\" she said falteringly. \"Harry, I don't think it's\nhealthy for you to be - thinking like that -\"",
      "\"I disagree. It's not thinking that gets people killed.\" The\nwords were spoken in a level monotone, as though reciting lines\nfrom a book.",
      "\"Harry,\" she said, hardly even thinking as she said it, \"there's\nnothing you could have done -\"",
      "Something flickered in Harry's expression. His eyes seemed to\nfocus on her for the first time.",
      "\"Nothing I could have done?\u202f\" Harry's voice rose on the\nlast word. \"Nothing I could have DONE? I've lost track of how\nmany different ways I could've saved her! If I'd asked to have us\nall given communications mirrors! If I'd insisted on Hermione being\ntaken out of Hogwarts and put in a school that isn't insane! If I'd\nsnuck out immediately instead of trying to argue with normal\npeople! If I'd remembered the Patronus earlier! If I'd thought\nthrough possible emergencies and trained myself to think about\nPatronuses earlier! Even at the very last minute it might not have\nbeen too late! I killed the troll and turned to her and she was\nstill ALIVE and I just knelt next to her listening to her last\nwords like an IDIOT instead of casting the Patronus again and\ncalling Dumbledore to send Fawkes! Or if I'd just approached\nthe whole problem from a different angle - if I'd looked for a\nstudent with a Time-Turner to send a message back in time\nbefore I found out about anything happening to her,\ninstead of ending up with an outcome that can't be altered - I\nasked the Headmaster to go back and save Hermione and then\nfake everything, fake the dead body, edit everyone's memories, but\nDumbledore said that he tried something like that once and it\ndidn't work and he lost another friend instead. Or if I'd - if I'd\nonly gone with - if, that night -\"",
      "Harry pressed his hands over his face, and when he removed them\nagain, his face was calm and composed once more.",
      "\"Anyway,\" said Harry Potter, now in a monotone again, \"I don't\nwant to repeat that mistake, so I'm going to spend until dinnertime\nthinking if there's anything I should be doing. If I haven't\nthought of anything by then I'll go to dinner and eat. Now please\ngo away.\"",
      "She was aware now that tears were sliding down her cheeks,\nagain. \"Harry - Harry, you have to believe that this isn't your\nfault!\"",
      "\"Of course it's my fault. There's no one else here who could be\nresponsible for anything.\"",
      "\"No! You-Know-Who killed Hermione!\" She was hardly aware of what\nshe was saying, that she hadn't screened the room against who might\nbe listening. \"Not you! No matter what else you could've done, it's\nnot you who killed her, it was Voldemort! If you can't believe that\nyou'll go mad, Harry!\"",
      "\"That's not how responsibility works, Professor.\" Harry's voice\nwas patient, like he was explaining things to a child who was\ncertain not to understand. He wasn't looking at her anymore, just\nstaring off at the wall to her right side. \"When you do a fault\nanalysis, there's no point in assigning fault to a part of the\nsystem you can't change afterward, it's like stepping off a cliff\nand blaming gravity. Gravity isn't going to change next time.\nThere's no point in trying to allocate responsibility to people who\naren't going to alter their actions. Once you look at it from that\nperspective, you realize that allocating blame never helps anything\nunless you blame yourself, because you're the only one whose\nactions you can change by putting blame there. That's why\nDumbledore has his room full of broken wands. He understands that\npart, at least.\"",
      "Some distant part of her mind made a note to wait until much\nlater and then speak sharply to the Headmaster about what he was\nshowing to impressionable young children. She might even scream at\nhim this time. She'd been thinking about screaming at him anyway,\nbecause of Miss Granger -",
      "\"You're not responsible,\" she said, though her voice\ntrembled. \"It's the Professors - it's us who are responsible for\nstudent safety, not you.\"",
      "Harry's eyes flicked back to her. \"You're responsible?\"\nThere was a tightness in the voice. \"You want me to hold you\nresponsible, Professor McGonagall?\"",
      "She raised her chin and nodded. It would be better, by far, than\nHarry blaming himself.",
      "The boy pushed himself up from where he was sitting on the\nfloor, and took a step forward. \"All right, then,\" Harry said in a\nmonotone. \"I tried to do the sensible thing, when I saw Hermione\nwas missing and that none of the Professors knew. I asked for a\nseventh-year student to go with me on a broomstick and protect me\nwhile we looked for Hermione. I asked for help. I begged for help.\nAnd nobody helped me. Because you gave everyone an absolute order\nto stay in one place or they'd be expelled, no excuses. No matter\nwhat else Dumbledore gets wrong, he at least thinks of his students\nas people, not animals that have to be herded into a pen and kept\nfrom wandering out. You knew you weren't any good at military\nthinking, your first idea was to have us walking through the\nhallways, you knew some students there were better than you at\nstrategy and tactics, and you still nailed us down in one room\nwithout any discretionary judgment. So when something you didn't\nforesee happened and it would've made perfect sense to send out a\nseventh-year student on a fast broom to look for Hermione Granger,\nthe students knew you wouldn't understand or forgive. They weren't\nafraid of the troll, they were afraid of you. The discipline, the\nconformity, the cowardice that you instilled in them\ndelayed me just long enough for Hermione to die. Not that I\nshould've tried asking for help from normal people, of course, and\nI will change and be less stupid next time. But if I were dumb\nenough to allocate responsibility to someone who isn't me, that's\nwhat I'd say.\"",
      "Tears were streaming down her cheeks.",
      "\"That's what I'd tell you if I thought you could be responsible\nfor anything. But normal people don't choose on the basis of\nconsequences, they just play roles. There's a picture in your head\nof a stern disciplinarian and you do whatever that picture would\ndo, whether or not it makes any sense. A stern disciplinarian would\norder the students back to their rooms, even if there was a troll\nroaming the hallways. A stern disciplinarian would order students\nnot to leave the Hall on pain of expulsion. And the little picture\nof Professor McGonagall that you have in your head can't learn from\nexperience or change herself, so there isn't any point to this\nconversation. People like you aren't responsible for anything,\npeople like me are, and when we fail there's no one else to\nblame.\"",
      "The boy strode forward to stand directly before her. His hand\ndarted beneath his robes, brought forth the golden sphere that was\nthe Ministry-issued protective shell of his Time Turner. He spoke\nin a dead, level voice without any emphasis. \"This could've saved\nHermione, if I'd been able to use it. But you thought it was your\nrole to shut me down and get in my way. Nobody has died in Hogwarts\nin fifty years, you said that when you locked it, do you remember?\nI should've asked again after Bellatrix Black got loose from\nAzkaban, or after Hermione got framed for attempted murder. But I\nforgot because I was stupid. Please unlock it now before any of my\nother friends die.\"",
      "Unable to speak, she brought forth her wand and did so,\nreleasing the time-keyed enchantment she'd laced into the shell's\nlock.",
      "Harry Potter flipped open the golden shell, looked at the tiny\nglass hourglass within its circles, nodded, and then snapped the\ncase shut. \"Thank you. Now go away.\" The boy's voice cracked again.\n\"I have to think.\"",
      "She closed the door behind her, an awful and still\nmostly-muffled sound escaping her throat -",
      "Albus shimmered into existence beside her, taking on a brief\ngarish hue as the Disillusionment wore off.",
      "She did not jump, quite. \"I've told you, stop doing that,\"\nMinerva said. Her voice sounded dull in her own ears. \"That was\nprivate.\"",
      "Albus flickered his fingers at the door behind her. \"I was\nafraid Mr. Potter might do you some harm.\" The Headmaster paused,\nthen said quietly, \"I am very surprised that you stood there and\ntook that.\"",
      "\"All I had to do was say 'Mr. Potter', and he would have\nstopped.\" Her voice had dropped almost to a whisper. \"Just that,\nand he would have stopped. And then he would have had no one to say\nthose awful things to, no one at all.\"",
      "\"I thought Mr. Potter's remarks were entirely unfair and\nundeserved,\" Albus said.",
      "\"If it had been you, Albus, you would not have threatened to\nexpel anyone leaving the room. Can you honestly tell me\notherwise?\"",
      "Albus's brows rose. \"Your role in this disaster was tiny, your\ndecisions quite sensible at the time, and it is only Harry Potter's\nperfect hindsight that lets him imagine otherwise. Surely you are\nwiser than to blame yourself for this, Minerva.\"",
      "She knew perfectly well that Albus would be placing a picture of\nHermione in that awful room of his, that it would occupy a place of\nhonor. Albus would hold himself responsible, she was\ncertain, even though he hadn't even been in Hogwarts at the time.\nBut not her.",
      "So you also don't think it's worth the trouble of holding me\nresponsible...",
      "She slumped against the nearest wall, trying not to let the\ntears emerge again; she'd never seen Albus weep save thrice. \"You\nhave always believed in your students, as I never have. They would\nnot have been afraid of you. They would have known you would\nunderstand.\"",
      "\"Minerva -\"",
      "\"I am not fit to succeed you as Headmistress. We both know\nit.\"",
      "\"You are wrong,\" Albus said quietly. \"When the time comes, you\nwill be the forty-fifth Headmistress of Hogwarts and you will do an\nexcellent job of it.\"",
      "She shook her head. \"What now, Albus? If he will not listen to\nme, then who?\"",
      "It was perhaps half an hour later. The boy still guarded the\ndoor to where his best friend's body lay, sitting his vigil. He was\nstaring downward, at his wand as it lay in his hands. Sometimes his\nface screwed up in thought, at other times it relaxed.",
      "Although the door did not open, and there was no sound, the boy\nlooked up. He composed his face. His voice, when he spoke, was\ndull. \"I don't want company.\"",
      "The door opened.",
      "The Defense Professor of Hogwarts entered into the room and shut\nthe door behind him, taking up careful position in a corner between\ntwo walls, as far away from the boy as the room permitted. A sharp\nsense of catastrophe had risen in the air between the two of them,\nand hung there unchanging.",
      "\"Why are you here?\" said the boy.",
      "The man tilted his head slightly. Pale eyes examined the boy as\nthough he were a specimen of life from a distant planet, and\ncorrespondingly dangerous.",
      "\"I've come to apologize, Mr. Potter,\" the man said quietly.",
      "\"Apologize for what?\" the boy said. \"Why, what could\nyou have done to prevent Hermione's death?\"",
      "\"I should have thought to check for the presence of yourself,\nMr. Longbottom, and Miss Granger, all of whom were obvious next\ntargets,\" the Defense Professor said without hesitation. \"Mr.\nHagrid was not mentally equipped to command the student contingent.\nI should have ignored the Deputy Headmistress's request for\nsilence, and told her to leave behind Professor Flitwick, who would\nhave been better able to defend the students from any threat, and\nwho could have maintained communication via Patronus.\"",
      "\"Correct.\" The boy's voice was razor-sharp. \"I'd forgotten there\nwas someone else in Hogwarts who could be responsible for things.\nSo why didn't you think of it, Professor? Because I don't believe\nthat you were stupid.\"",
      "There was a pause, and the boy's fingers whitened on his\nwand.",
      "\"You did not think of it either, Mr. Potter, at the time.\" There\nwas a weariness in the Defense Professor's voice. \"I am smarter\nthan you. I think faster than you. I am more experienced than you.\nBut the gap between the two of us is not the same as the gap\nbetween us and them. If you can miss something, then so can I.\" The\nman's lips twisted. \"You see, I deduced at once that the troll was\nbut a distraction from some other matter, and of no great\nimportance in itself. So long as nobody sent the students wandering\npointlessly through the halls, or uncaringly dispatched the young\nSlytherins to those very dungeons where the troll had been\nspotted.\"",
      "The boy did not seem to relax. \"I suppose that is\nplausible.\"",
      "\"In any case,\" said the man, \"if there is anyone who can be said\nto be responsible for Miss Granger's death, it is myself, not you.\nIt is I, not you, who should have -\"",
      "\"I perceive that you have spoken to Professor McGonagall and\nthat she has given you a script to follow.\" The boy did not bother\nkeeping the bitterness from his voice. \"If you have something to\nsay to me, Professor, say it without the masks.\"",
      "There was a pause.",
      "\"As you wish,\" the Defense Professor said emotionlessly. The\npale eyes stayed keen and sharp. \"I do regret that the girl is\ndead. She was a good student in my Defense class, and could have\nbeen an ally to you later. I would wish to console you for your\nloss, but I cannot see how to go about doing so. Naturally, if I\nfind the ones responsible I shall kill them. You are welcome to\njoin in should circumstances permit.\"",
      "\"How touching,\" the boy said, his voice cool. \"You are not\nclaiming to have liked Hermione, then?\"",
      "\"Her charms were lost on me, I suspect. I no longer form such\nbonds easily.\"",
      "The boy nodded. \"Thank you for being honest. Is that all,\nProfessor?\"",
      "There was a pause.",
      "\"The castle is scarred, now,\" said the man standing in the\ncorner.",
      "\"What?\"",
      "\"When a certain ancient device in my possession informed me that\nMiss Granger was on the verge of death, I cast that spell of cursed\nfire of which I once spoke. I burned through some walls and floors\nso that my broomstick could take a more direct path.\" The man still\nspoke tonelessly. \"Hogwarts will not heal such wounds easily, if at\nall. I suppose it will be necessary to patch over the holes with\nlesser conjurations. I regret that now, since I was in any case too\nlate.\"",
      "\"Ah,\" said the boy. He closed his eyes briefly. \"You did want to\nsave her. You wanted it so strongly that you made some sort of\nactual effort. I suppose your mind, if not theirs, would be capable\nof that.\"",
      "A brief, dry smile from the man.",
      "\"Thank you for that, Professor. But I would like to be left\nalone now until dinnertime. You of all people will understand. Is\nthat all?\"",
      "\"Not quite,\" the man said. A tinge of sardonic dryness now\nreturned to his voice. \"You see, based on recent experiences, I am\nconcerned that you may now intend to do something extremely\nfoolish.\"",
      "\"Such as what?\" said the boy.",
      "\"I am not quite sure. Perhaps you have decided that a universe\nwithout Miss Granger is devoid of value, and should be destroyed\nfor the insults it has dealt you.\"",
      "The boy smiled without any humor. \"Your own issues are showing,\nProfessor. I don't really go in for that sort of thing. Did you, at\nsome point?\"",
      "\"Not particularly. I have no great fondness for the universe,\nbut I do live there.\"",
      "There was a pause.",
      "\"What are you planning, Mr. Potter?\" said the man in the corner.\n\"You have come to some significant resolution, though you are\ntrying to hide it from me. What do you now intend?\"",
      "The boy shook his head. \"I'm still thinking, and would like to\nbe left alone to do it.\"",
      "\"I recall an offer you once made to me, some months ago,\" said\nthe Defense Professor. \"Do you want someone intelligent to talk to?\nI will understand if you are not pleasant to be around.\"",
      "The boy shook his head again. \"No, thank you.\"",
      "\"Well, then,\" said the Defense Professor. \"What about someone\nwho is powerful and not particularly bound by naive scruples?\"",
      "There was a hesitation, and then the boy once more shook his\nhead.",
      "\"Someone who is knowledgeable of much secret lore, and magics\nthat some might consider to be unnatural?\"",
      "There was a slight narrowing of the boy's eyes, so imperceptible\nthat someone else might not have -",
      "\"I see,\" said the Defense Professor. \"Go ahead and ask me about\nit, then. I give you my word that I will repeat nothing of it to\nthe others.\"",
      "The boy took a while to speak, and when he did it was in a\ncracked voice.",
      "\"I mean to bring Hermione back. Because there isn't an\nafterlife, and I'm not about to just let her - just not be\n-\"",
      "The boy pressed his hands over his face, and when he withdrew\nthem, he once more seemed as dispassionate as the man standing in\nthe corner.",
      "The Defense Professor's eyes were abstract, and faintly\npuzzled.",
      "\"How?\" the man said finally.",
      "\"However I have to.\"",
      "There was another pause.",
      "\"Regardless of the risks,\" the man in the corner said.\n\"Regardless of how dangerous the magic required to accomplish\nit.\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "The Defense Professor's eyes were thoughtful. \"But what general\napproach did you have in mind? I presume that turning her corpse\ninto an Inferius is not what you -\"",
      "\"Would she be able to think?\" the boy said. \"Would her body\nstill decay?\"",
      "\"No, and yes.\"",
      "\"Then no.\"",
      "\"What of the Resurrection Stone of Cadmus Peverell, if it could\nbe obtained for you?\"",
      "The boy shook his head. \"I don't want an illusion of Hermione\ndrawn from my memories. I want her to be able to live her\nlife -\" the boy's voice cracked. \"I haven't decided yet on\nan object-level angle of attack. If I have to brute-force the\nproblem by acquiring enough power and knowledge to just make it\nhappen, I will.\"",
      "Another pause.",
      "\"And to go about that,\" the man in the corner said,\n\"you will use your favorite tool, science.\"",
      "\"Of course.\"",
      "The Defense Professor exhaled, almost like a sigh. \"I suppose\nthat makes sense of it.\"",
      "\"Are you willing to help, or not?\" the boy said.",
      "\"What help do you seek?\"",
      "\"Magic. Where does it come from?\"",
      "\"I do not know,\" said the man.",
      "\"And neither does anyone else?\"",
      "\"Oh, the situation is far worse than that, Mr. Potter. There is\nhardly a scholar of the esoteric who has not unraveled the nature\nof magic, and every one of them believes something different.\"",
      "\"Where do new spells come from? I keep reading about someone who\ninvented a spell to do something-or-other but there's no mention of\nhow.\"",
      "A shrug of robed shoulders. \"Where do new books come from, Mr.\nPotter? Those who read many books sometimes become able to write\nthem in turn. How? No one knows.\"",
      "\"There are books on how to write -\"",
      "\"Reading them will not make you a famous playwright. After all\nsuch advice is accounted for, what remains is mystery. The\ninvention of new spells is a similar mystery of purer form.\" The\nman's head tilted. \"Such endeavors are dangerous. The saying is\nthat one should either not have children, or else wait until after\nthey are grown. There is a reason why so many innovators seem to\nhail from Gryffindor, rather than Ravenclaw as might be\nexpected.\"",
      "\"And the more powerful sorts of magics?\" the boy said.",
      "\"A legendary wizard might invent one sacrificial ritual in his\nlife, and pass on the knowledge to his heirs. To try inventing five\nsuch would be suicide. That is why wizards of true power are those\nwho have acquired ancient lore.\"",
      "The boy nodded distantly. \"So much for the direct solution,\nthen. It would've been nice to just invent a spell for 'Raise\nDead', 'Become God' or 'Summon Terminal'. Do you know anything\nabout Atlantis?\"",
      "\"Only what any scholar knows,\" the man said dryly. \"If you would\nlike to hear about the top eighteen standard theories - do not\nglare at me, Mr. Potter. If it were that simple, I would have done\nit many years earlier.\"",
      "\"I understand. Sorry.\"",
      "There was a time of silence. The Defense Professor's gaze rested\non the boy, the boy stared off seemingly at nothing.",
      "\"There's some magics I mean to learn. Spells I could've used\nearlier today, if I'd thought to study them beforehand.\" The boy's\nvoice was cold. \"Spells I'll need, if this sort of thing goes on\nhappening. Most I expect I can just look up. Some I expect I\ncan't.\"",
      "The Defense Professor inclined his head. \"I shall teach you\nalmost any magic you wish to know, Mr. Potter. I do have some\nlimits, but you may always ask. But what specifically do you seek?\nYou lack the raw power for the Killing Curse and most other spells\ndeemed forbidden -\"",
      "\"That spell of cursed fire. I don't suppose it's a sacrificial\nritual that even a child could use, if he dared?\"",
      "The Defense Professor's lips twitched. \"It requires the\npermanent sacrifice of a drop of blood; your body would be lighter\nby that drop of blood, from that day forward. Not the sort of thing\none would wish to do often, Mr. Potter. Strength of will is\ndemanded for the cursed fire not to turn upon you and consume you;\nthe usual practice is to first test one's will in lesser trials.\nAnd although it is not a primary element of the ritual, I am afraid\nthat it does require more magic than you shall possess for another\nfew years.\"",
      "\"Pity,\" the boy said. \"It would've been nice to see the look on\nthe enemy's face the next time they tried using a troll.\"",
      "The Defense Professor inclined his head, his lips twitching\nagain.",
      "\"What about Memory Charms? The Weasley twins were acting oddly\nand the Headmaster said he thinks they've been Obliviated. It seems\nto be one of the enemy's favorite tricks.\"",
      "\"Rule Eight,\" said the Defense Professor. \"Any technique which\nis good enough to defeat me once is good enough to learn\nmyself.\"",
      "The boy smiled humorlessly. \"And I once heard about an adult\ncasting Obliviate while she was almost completely drained, so it\nmust not take too much magic to cast. It's not even considered\nUnforgiveable, though I can't imagine why not. If I could've made\nMr. Hagrid remember a different set of orders -\"",
      "\"It is not that straightforward,\" said the Defense Professor.\n\"You are not powerful enough to use the False Memory Charm, and\neven a simple Obliviation will stretch the edge of your current\nstamina. It is a dangerous art, illegal to use without Ministry\nauthorization, and I would caution you not to use it under\ncircumstances where it would be inconvenient to accidentally erase\nten years of someone's life. I wish I could promise you that I\nwould obtain one of those highly guarded tomes from the Department\nof Mysteries, and pass it to you beneath a disguised cover. But\nwhat I must actually tell you is that you will find the standard\nintroductory text in the north-northwest stacks of the main\nHogwarts library, filed under M.\"",
      "\"Seriously,\" the boy said flatly.",
      "\"Indeed.\"",
      "\"Thank you for your guidance, Professor.\"",
      "\"Your creativity has become a great deal more practical, Mr.\nPotter, since I have known you.\"",
      "\"Thank you for the compliment.\" The boy did not look up from\nwhere he was again gazing down at the wand held between his hands.\n\"I would like to go back to thinking now. Please explain to them on\nmy behalf what happens if I am disturbed.\"",
      "The door to the storeroom clicked open, and Professor Quirrell\nstepped out. His face had a dead, emotionless look to it; she would\nhave said that it reminded her of Severus, though Severus had never\nlooked quite like that.",
      "Even as the door clicked shut again, Minerva had thrown up a\nwordless Quieting barrier. The words spilled forth from her\nrapidly: \"How did it go - you were in there for a while - is Harry\ntalking now?\"",
      "Professor Quirrell paced swiftly across the room to the far wall\nnear the entrance, looked back at her. The emotionlessness slid off\nhis face, as though he were taking off a mask, leaving behind\nsomeone very grim. \"I spoke to Mr. Potter as he expected me to\nspeak, and avoided saying things that would annoy him. I do not\nthink it consoled him. I do not think I have the knack.\"",
      "\"Thank you - it is good that he spoke at all -\" She hesitated.\n\"What did Mr. Potter say?\"",
      "\"I am afraid that I promised him not to speak of it. And now...\nI think that I must visit the Hogwarts library.\"",
      "\"The library?\u202f\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Professor Quirrell said. An uncharacteristic tension had\ncome into his voice. \"I intend to strengthen the security upon the\nRestricted Section with certain precautions of my own devising. The\ncurrent wards are a joke. And Mr. Potter must be kept out of the\nRestricted Section at all costs.\"",
      "She stared at the Defense Professor, her heart suddenly in her\nthroat.",
      "Professor Quirrell continued speaking. \"You will not\ntell the boy that I have said this much to you. You will confirm to\nFlitwick and Vector that the boy is to be diverted by the usual\nevasions if he asks precocious questions about spell creation. And\nthough it is not my own area of expertise, Deputy Headmistress, if\nthere is any way you can imagine to convince the boy to stop\nsinking further into his grief and madness - any way at all to undo\nthe resolutions he is coming to - then I suggest you resort to it\nimmediately.\""

      "\"If you actually care about my mental health,\" the boy said\nwithout looking up, \"you will go away, leave me alone, and wait for\nme to come down to dinner. This isn't helping.\"",
      "The door opened, and the one who had waited outside stepped\nin.",

      "The door closed and clicked behind Severus Snape.",
      "The Potions Master of Hogwarts wore none of his customary\narrogance, or even the dispassionate guise that he ordinarily took\nin the Headmaster's office; his gaze was strange, as he looked down\nupon the boy guarding that door; his thoughts unfathomable.",
      "\"I also cannot imagine what the Deputy Headmistress is\nthinking,\" said the Potions Master of Hogwarts. \"Unless I am meant\nto serve as a warning of where it will lead you, if you decide to\ntake the blame for her death upon yourself.\"",
      "The boy's lips pressed together. \"Fine. Let's just skip ahead to\nthe end of this conversation. You win, Professor Snape. I concede\nthat you were more responsible for Lily Potter's death than I was\nresponsible for Hermione Granger's death, and that my guilt can't\nstack up to your guilt. And then I ask you to go, and you tell them\nthat it would probably be best to let me alone for a while. Are we\ndone?\"",
      "\"Almost,\" the Potions Master said. \"I am the one who put the\nnotes under Miss Granger's pillow, telling her where to find the\nfights in which she intervened.\"",
      "The boy did not react to this at all. Finally he spoke. \"Because\nyou dislike bullying.\"",
      "\"Not that alone.\" There was a note of pain in the Potions\nMaster's voice that sounded alien to it; it was hard to imagine it\nbeing the same acid voice that instructed children not to stir one\nmore time or they'd blow off their wrists. \"I should have realized\nit... very much earlier, I suppose, and yet I did not see it at\nall, being entirely absorbed in myself. For me to be placed as Head\nof Slytherin... it means that Albus Dumbledore has entirely lost\nhope that Slytherin House can be helped. I am certain that\nDumbledore must have tried, I cannot imagine that he did not try,\nwhen he first took trust of Hogwarts. It must have been a severe\nblow to him, when after that so much of Slytherin answered to the\nDark Lord's call... he would not have placed me in authority over\nthat House, acting as I did, unless he had lost all hope.\" The\nPotions Master's shoulders fell, beneath his spotted and stained\ncloak. \"But you and Miss Granger were trying to do something, and\nthe two of you had even managed to bring over Mr. Malfoy and Miss\nGreengrass, and perhaps those two could have set a different\nexample... I suppose it was foolish for me to believe. The\nHeadmaster does not know of what I have done, and I ask you not to\ntell him.\"",
      "\"Why are you telling me this?\"",
      "\"Matters have become far too serious not to tell someone.\"\nSeverus Snape's lips twisted. \"I have seen enough disastrous\nplotting, in my tenure as Head of Slytherin, to know how that\nsometimes goes. If, in the future, all should come to light - then\nat least I have told you, and you may say as much.\"",
      "\"Lovely,\" the boy said. \"Thank you for clearing that up. Is that\nall?\"",
      "\"Do you intend to declare that your life is now a ruin and that\nthere is nothing left for you but vengeance?\"",
      "\"No. I still have -\" The boy cut himself off.",
      "\"Then there is very little advice that I can give you,\" said\nSeverus Snape.",

      "The Potions Master turned to the door, and when his face was\nunseen, his voice came in a whisper. \"I truly am sorry for your\nloss.\"",
      "Severus Snape departed.",
      "The boy stared after him, trying to remember, as best as he\ncould at this distance, words which had been spoken some time\nearlier.",
      "Your books betrayed you, Potter. They did not tell you the\none thing you needed to know. You cannot learn from books what it\nis like to lose the one you love. That is something you could never\nknow without experiencing it for yourself.",
      "It had gone something like that, the boy thought, if he was\nremembering correctly.",
      "Hours had passed now, in the infirmary section with its closed\ndoor and a body lying in state behind it.",
      "Harry went on staring at his wand, as it lay in his lap. At the\ntiny scratches and smudges on the eleven inches of holly, flaws\nhe'd never looked closely enough to notice before. A quick mental\ncalculation said there was no reason to worry since if this was six\nor seven months' accumulation of damage, then a standard lifetime\nwouldn't wear away the wand entirely. At the time, he probably\nwould've worried about his own Time-Turner being taken away if he'd\njust openly yelled out 'Does anyone have a Time-Turner?' into the\nGreat Hall, but it would have been easy enough to precommit to,\nafter lunch, finding someone to send Professor Flitwick a message\ntwo hours earlier and then Professor Flitwick could've just gone\nstraight to Hermione, or sent her his raven Patronus, long before\nthe troll was anywhere near her. Or might that alternate Harry have\nalready learned it was too late - heard about Hermione's death\nafter lunch and before he could buy any messages sent backwards in\ntime? Maybe a basic guideline of working with time-travel was to\nmake sure you never risked learning you were too late, if you\nhadn't yet gone backwards. There was a tiny chemical burn now on\nthe end of his wand, presumably from contacting the acid he'd\npartially Transfigured the troll's brain into, but the wand seemed\nrobust against losses of small amounts of wood. Really the concept\nof a 'magic wand' being required just got stranger the more you\nthought about it. Though if spells were always being invented in\nsome mysterious way, new rituals being carved as new levers upon\nthe unknown machine, it might just be that people just kept\ninventing rituals that involved wands, just like they invented\nphrases like 'Wingardium Leviosa'. It really seemed like magic\nought to be, in some sense, almost arbitrarily powerful, and it\ncertainly would be convenient if Harry could just bypass whatever\nconceptual limitation prevented people from inventing spells like\n'Just Fix Everything Forever', but somehow nothing was ever that\neasy where magic was concerned. Harry looked at his mechanical\nwatch again, but it still wasn't time.",
      "He'd attempted to cast the Patronus Charm, meaning to tell his\nPatronus to go to Hermione Granger. Just in case it was all a lie,\na False Memory Charm or one of the who-knew-how-many-ways that\nwizards could be made to close their eyes and dream. Just in case\nthe real Hermione was alive and being held somewhere, despite his\nfeeling her life as it left her. Just in case there was an\nafterlife and the True Patronus could reach it.",
      "The spell hadn't worked though, so that particular test had\nfailed to provide any evidence, leaving him with the previous,\nunfavorable prior.",
      "Time passed, and yet more time. From the outside you would've\njust seen a boy, sitting, staring at his wand with an abstracted\ngaze, looking at his watch every two minutes or so.",
      "The door to the infirmary section opened once\nagain.",
      "The boy sitting there looked up with a deadly, chilling\nglare.",
      "Then the boy's face cracked in dismay, and he scrambled to his\nfeet.",
      "\"Harry,\" said the man in the button-down formal shirt and a\nblack vest thrown over it. His voice was hoarse. \"Harry, what's\nhappening? The Headmaster of your school - he showed up in those\nridiculous robes at my office and told me that Hermione Granger was\ndead!\"",
      "A moment later a woman followed the man into the room; she\nseemed less confused than the man, less bewildered and more\nfrightened.",

      "\"No! Harry, what's happening?\"",

      "\"Harry,\" the woman said falteringly. \"Harry -\"",
      "\"Dad, you know those fantasy books where the hero has to hide\neverything from his parents because they, they wouldn't understand,\nthey'd react stupidly and get in the hero's way? It's a plot\ndevice, right, so that the hero has to solve everything himself\ninstead of telling his parents. P-please don't be that plot device,\nDad, or you either, Mum. Just... just don't play that role. Don't\nbe the parents who won't understand. D-don't yell at me and give me\nparental demands I can't follow. Because I've wandered into a\nbloody stupid fantasy novel and now Hermione's - I j-just don't\nhave the energy to deal with it.\"",
      "Slowly, as though his limbs were only half-animated, the man in\nthe black vest kneeled down to where Harry was standing, so that\nhis eyes were level with his son's. \"Harry,\" the man said. \"I need\nyou to tell me everything that has happened, right now.\"",
      "The boy took a deep breath, swallowed. \"They t-tell me the Dark\nLord I defeated may still be alive. Like that's not the p-plot of a\nhundred sodding books, right? So, it could also be that the\nHeadmaster of my school, who's the most powerful wizard in the\nworld, has gone insane. And, and Hermione was framed for an\nattempted murder just before this, not that anyone would've told\nher parents about it or anything. The student she was framed for\nattempted-murdering was the son of Lucius Malfoy, who's the most\npowerful politician in magical Britain, and used to be the Dark\nLord's number two. The Defense Professor position at this school\nhas a curse on it, nobody ever lasts more than a year, they have a\nsaying that the Defense Professor is always a suspect. This year\nthe Defense Professor is secretly a mysterious wizard who opposed\nthe Dark Lord during the last war and may or may not be evil\nhimself. Also the Potions Master has been pining after Lily Potter\nfor years and might be behind this whole thing for some twisted\npsychological reason.\" The boy's lips pressed together bitterly. \"I\nthink that's most of the bloody stupid plot.\"",
      "The man, who had listened to all this quietly, stood up. He put\na gentle hand on the boy's shoulder. \"That's enough, Harry,\" he\nsaid. \"I've heard enough. We're leaving this school right now and\ntaking you with us.\"",
      "The woman was looking at the boy, her face asking a\nquestion.",
      "The boy gazed back at her and nodded.",
      "The woman's voice was thin when she spoke. \"They won't\nlet us, Michael.\"",
      "\"They have no legal right to stop us -\"",
      "\"Right? You're Muggles,\" said the boy. He\nsmiled twistedly. \"You have as much standing in the magical British\nlegal system as mice. No wizard is going to care about any\narguments you make about rights, about fairness,\nthey won't even take the time to listen. You don't have any\npower, see, so they don't have to bother. No, Mum, I'm not\nsmiling like this because I agree with their Muggle policies, I'm\nsmiling because I disagree with your children policies.\"",
      "\"Then,\" Professor Michael Verres-Evans said firmly, \"we shall\nsee what the real government has to say about that. I know\nan MP or three -\"",
      "\"They'll say, you're crazy, have a nice stay in this asylum.\nThat's assuming the Ministry Obliviators don't get to you first and\nerase your memories. They do that to Muggles a lot, I hear. I\nfigure the real higher-ups in our government have formed some cozy\naccomodations of their own. Maybe they get a few healing Charms now\nand then, if someone important manages to get cancer.\" The boy gave\nthat twisted smile again. \"And that's the situation, Dad, as Mum\nalready knows. They'd never have brought you here or told you\nanything, if there was a single thing you could do about it.\"",
      "The man's mouth opened but no words came out, as though he had\nbeen reading from a script which described what a concerned parent\nought to do in this sort of situation, and this script had suddenly\narrived at a blank spot.",
      "\"Harry,\" the woman said falteringly.",
      "The boy looked at her.",
      "\"Harry, did something happen to you? You seem...\ndifferent...\"",
      "\"Petunia!\" the man said, his tongue apparently working once\nmore. \"Don't say such things! He's under stress, that's all.\"",
      "\"Well, Mum, you see -\" The boy's voice cracked. \"Are you sure\nyou want this all at once, Mum?\"",
      "The woman nodded, though she didn't speak.",
      "\"I've got... you know how that school psychiatrist thought I had\nanger management problems? Well -\" The boy stopped, and swallowed.\n\"I don't know how to explain this to you, Mum. It's something\nmagical instead. Probably something to do with whatever happened on\nthe night my parents died. I have... well, I was calling it a\nmysterious dark side and I know it sounds like a joke and I\ndid check with... with an ancient telepathic magical hat\nto make sure my scar wasn't actually inhabited by the Dark\nLord's spirit and it said that there was only one person under its\nbrim and I don't think wizards have actual souls anyway since they\ncan still suffer from brain damage, only -\"",
      "\"Harry, slow down!\" said the man.",
      "\"- only, only whatever it is, it's still real, there's\nsomething inside me, it gave me willpower when things were bad, I\ncould face down anything so long as I was angry, Snape, Dumbledore,\nthe entire Wizengamot, my dark side wasn't afraid of anything but\nDementors. And I wasn't stupid, I knew that there might be a price\nfor using my dark side and I kept on looking to see what the price\nmight be. It didn't change my magic, it didn't seem to cause\npermanent alignment shift, it didn't try to take me away from my\nfriends or anything like that, so I kept on using it whenever I had\nto and I only figured out too late what the price really was -\" The\nboy's voice had become almost a whisper. \"I only figured out\ntoday... every time I call on it... it uses up my childhood. I\nkilled the thing that got Hermione. And it wasn't my dark side that\ndid it, it was me. Oh, Mum, Dad, I'm sorry.\"",
      "There was a long silence filled with the sound of broken\nmasks.",
      "\"Harry,\" the man said, kneeling down again, \"I need you to start\nover from the beginning and explain that much more slowly.\"",
      "The boy spoke.",
      "The parents listened.",
      "Some time later, the father stood up.",
      "The boy looked up at him, grimacing in bitter anticipation.",
      "\"Harry,\" the man said, \"Petunia and I are going to get you out\nof here as quickly as possible -\"",
      "\"Don't,\" the boy said warningly. \"I mean it, Dad. The Ministry\nof Magic isn't something you can stand up to. Pretend they're the\ntax office or the dean or something else that won't brook any\nchallenge to their dominance. In magical Britain you're only\nallowed to remember what the government thinks you should remember,\nand remembering the existence of magic or that you have a son named\nHarry is a privilege, not a right. And if they did that I'd crack\nand turn the Ministry into a giant flaming crater. Mum, you know\nthe score, you absolutely have to stop Dad from trying anything\nstupid.\"",
      "\"And son -\" The man rubbed at his temples. \"Maybe I shouldn't\nsay this now... but are you sure that what you're talking about is\nreally a magical dark side, and not something normal for a boy your\nage?\"",
      "\"Normal,\" the boy said with elaborate patience. \"Normal how,\nexactly? I could check again, but I'm reasonably sure there wasn't\nanything about this in Childcraft: A Guide For Parents. My\ndark side isn't just an emotional state, it makes me\nsmarter. In some ways, anyhow. You can't just pretend\nyourself smarter.\"",
      "The man rubbed at his head again. \"Well... there's a certain\nwell-known phenomenon wherein children undergo a biological process\nwhich can sometimes make them angry and dark and grim, and this\nprocess also significantly increases their intelligence and their\nheight -\"",
      "The boy slumped back against the wall. \"No, Dad, it's not that\nI'm turning into a teenager. I checked with my brain and it still\nthinks that girls are icky. But if that's what you want to pretend,\nthen fine. Maybe I'm better off with you not believing me. I just\n-\" The boy's voice choked. \"I just couldn't stand lying about\nit.\"",
      "\"Adolescence doesn't necessarily work like that, Harry. It may\nstill take a while for you to notice girls. If, in fact, you\nhaven't noticed one alrea-\" and the man abruptly stopped.",
      "\"I didn't like Hermione in that way,\" the boy whispered. \"Why\ndoes everyone keep thinking it has to be about that? It's\ndisrespectful to her, to think someone could only like her in that\nway.\"",
      "The man swallowed visibly. \"Anyway, son, you keep yourself safe\nwhile we work on getting you out of here, is that understood? Don't\nyou go actually thinking that you've turned to the dark side. I\nknow you've had, ah, what I used to call your Ender Wiggin moments\n-\"",
      "\"I think we are now well past Ender and on to Ender\nafter the buggers kill Valentine.\"",
      "\"Language!\" said the woman, and then her hand flew to cover her\nmouth.",
      "The boy spoke wearily. \"Not that kind of bugger, Mum. They're\ninsectoid aliens - never mind.\"",
      "\"Harry, that's exactly what I'm saying you shouldn't think,\"\nProfessor Verres-Evans said firmly. \"You're not to go believing\nthat you're turning evil. You are not to hurt anyone, place\nyourself in harm's way, or mess around with any sort of black magic\nwhatsoever, while your Mum and I work on extracting you from this\nsituation. Is that clear, son?\"",
      "The boy closed his eyes. \"That'd be wonderful advice, Dad, if\nonly I were in a comic book.\"",
      "\"Harry -\" the man began.",
      "\"Police can't do that. Soldiers can't do that. The most powerful\nwizard in the world couldn't do that, and he tried. It's not fair\nto the innocent bystanders to play at being Batman if you can't\nactually protect everyone under that code. And I've just proven\nthat I can't.\"",
      "Beads of sweat were glistening on Professor Michael\nVerres-Evans's forehead. \"Now you listen to me. No matter what\nyou've read in books, you aren't supposed to be protecting\nanyone! Or involving yourself in anything dangerous! Absolutely\nanything dangerous whatsoever! Just stay out of the way of\neverything, every bit of craziness going on in this\nmadhouse, while we get you out of here the first instant we\npossibly can!\"",
      "The boy looked searchingly at his father, then his mother. Then\nhe looked at his wristwatch again.",
      "\"Excellent point,\" said the boy.",
      "The boy marched over to the door leading outward, and flung it\nopen.",
      "The door flew open with a crack that caused Minerva to startle\nwhere she stood, and before she had time to think, Harry Potter\nmarched out of the room, glaring directly at her.",
      "\"You brought my parents here,\" the Boy-Who-Lived said.\n\"To Hogwarts. Where You-Know-Who or someone is\nlurking around, targeting my friends. What exactly were you\nthinking?\"",
      "She did not reply that she had been thinking about Harry sitting\nin front of the door to the storeroom containing Hermione's body,\nrefusing to move.",
      "\"Who else knows about this?\" Harry Potter demanded. \"Did anyone\nsee them with you?\"",
      "\"The Headmaster brought them here -\"",
      "\"I want them out of here immediately before anyone else\nnotices, especially You-Know-Who, but also including Professor\nQuirrell or Professor Snape. Please send your Patronus to the\nHeadmaster and tell him that he needs to bring it back at once. Do\nnot mention my parents by name, or as people, in case somebody else\nis listening.\"",
      "\"Indeed,\" said Professor Verres-Evans, nodding sternly along\nwith this from where he stood directly behind the boy, Petunia a\nstep behind him. His hand rested firmly on Harry's shoulder. \"We'll\nfinish talking to our son at home.\"",
      "\"A moment, please,\" Minerva said in reflexive politeness. Her\nfirst try at casting the Patronus failed, a disadvantage of that\nCharm under certain circumstances. It wasn't the first time she'd\ndone it so, but she seemed to have lost some of the knack -",
      "Minerva shut the thought down and concentrated.",
      "When the message was sent, she turned back to Professor\nVerres-Evans. \"Sir,\" she said, \"I'm afraid that Mr. Potter must not\nleave the Hogwarts School -\"",
      "By the time Albus finally arrived, there was shouting, the\nMuggle man having given up on dignity. At least there was shouting\non one side of the argument. Minerva's heart wasn't in it. The\ntruth was that she couldn't believe the words coming out of her\nmouth.",
      "When the Professor turned to argue with the Headmaster, Harry\nPotter, who had remained silent through this, spoke up. \"Not here,\"\nsaid Harry. \"You can argue with him anywhere but Hogwarts, Dad.\nMum, please, please make sure that Dad doesn't try anything that\nwill get him in trouble with the Ministry.\"",
      "Michael Verres-Evans's face screwed up. He turned, looked at\nHarry Potter. When his voice came out it was hoarse, accompanied by\nwater in his eyes. \"Son - what are you doing?\"",
      "\"You know perfectly well what I'm doing,\" Harry Potter said.\n\"You read those comic books long before you gave them to me. I've\nbeen through a bunch of crap, matured a bit, and now I'm protecting\nmy relatives. Actually, it's simpler than that, you know what I'm\ndoing because you tried to do the same thing. I'm having my loved\nones taken out of Hogwarts immediately, that's what I'm doing.\nHeadmaster, please get them out of here before You-Know-Who\ndiscovers their presence and marks them for death.\"",
      "Michael Verres-Evans began a frantic dash toward Harry, and then\nall motion stopped with the Muggle man leaning forward in his\nflight.",
      "\"I am sorry,\" the Headmaster said quietly. \"We shall speak more\nsoon. Minerva, I was with the others when you called, they are\nwaiting in your office.\"",
      "The Headmaster passed forwards like he was gliding, until he\nstood in the midst of where the man and woman stood frozen; and\nthere was another flash of flame.",
      "Motion resumed.",
      "Minerva looked at Harry.",
      "Words did not come to her.",
      "\"Clever move, bringing them here,\" Harry Potter said. \"Probably\ndamaged our relationship permanently. All I wanted was to be bloody\nleft alone until bloody dinnertime. Which,\" the boy looked at his\nwristwatch, \"it now is anyway. I'm going to go say goodbye\nto Hermione by myself, which I promise will take less than two\nminutes, and then after that I'll come out and go eat something\nlike I would have done regardless. Do not disturb me for\nthose two bloody minutes or I will snap and try to kill someone, I\nmean it, Professor.\"",
      "The boy turned and strode into the small room, opened the rear\ndoor to where Hermione Granger's body was being kept, and strode\ninside before she could think to speak. Through the doorway she saw\na flash of a sight she knew no child ought to see -",
      "The door slammed shut.",
      "She started forwards, unthinking.",
      "Halfway to the door, she stopped herself.",
      "Her mind was still slow, and hurting, and the part of her that\nHarry Potter would have called the picture of a stern\ndisciplinarian was lifelessly mouthing words about\ninappropriate behavior from children. The rest of her didn't think\nit was a good idea to leave any child, even Harry Potter, alone in\na room with the bloody corpse of his best friend. But the act of\nopening the door, or asserting any sort of authority, did not seem\nto her wise. There was no right thing to do, and no right thing to\nsay; or if there was any right path, she did not know it.",
      "Very slowly, a minute and a half passed.",
      "When the door opened again, Harry seemed to have changed, as\nthough that minute and a half had passed over the course of\nlifetimes.",
      "\"Seal up the room,\" Harry said quietly, \"and let's go, Professor\nMcGonagall.\"",
      "She walked over to the storeroom door. She wasn't quite able to\nstop herself from looking in, and saw the dried blood, the sheet\ncovering the lower half, the upper body waxy and doll-like, and a\nglimpse of Hermione Granger's closed eyes. Something inside her\nbegan its weeping all over again.",
      "She closed the door.",
      "Her fingers moved upon her wand, her mouth spoke words without\nthought, Charms and wards to seal the room against entry.",
      "\"Professor McGonagall,\" Harry said in a strange voice, as if by\nrote, \"do you have the rock? The rock that the Headmaster gave me?\nI should Transfigure it into a jewel again, since it did prove\nuseful.\"",
      "Automatically her eyes went to the ring on Harry's left pinky\nfinger, noting the emptiness of the setting where the jewel should\nhave been. \"I shall mention it to the Headmaster,\" her tongue\nreplied.",
      "\"Is that a usual tactic, by the way?\" Harry said, voice still\nodd. \"Carrying something large Transfigured into something small to\nuse as a weapon? Or is that a usual exercise for Transfiguration\npractice?\"",
      "Distantly, she shook her head.",
      "\"Well, let's go, then.\"",
      "\"I have -\" her voice stopped. \"I'm afraid I have something else\nwhich I must do, now. Will you be all right on your own, and will\nyou promise to go to the Great Hall directly and eat something, Mr.\nPotter?\"",
      "The boy promised (barring exceptional and unforeseen\ncircumstances, a clause with which she did not argue) and then\nwalked out of the room.",
      "What lay ahead of her... would be no easier, certainly, and\nmight well be harder.",
      "Minerva walked to her office at a swift pace; not slowly, for\nthat would have been a discourtesy.",
      "Professor McGonagall opened the door to her office.",
      "\"Madam Granger,\" her voice said, \"Mr. Granger, I am so terribly\nsorry for -\""

With all his energies of\nthought exhausted, his mind was starting to throw out thoughts like\nan image of Hermione walking beside him and wordless concepts like\nThat will never happen again until another part yelled\nNo and shouted it down with determination to bring her\nback, only that part's voice was getting tired and the other part\nseemed tireless. Another part of his mind insisted on reviewing\nwhat he'd said to Professor McGonagall and Dad and Mum, even though\nhe'd only been trying to get them out of there as quickly as\npossible and had been running on limited mental energy. As though\nsomehow he could have done better, by an act of his defective will.\nWhat would be left of his relationship with his parents now, Harry\ncouldn't guess.",
      "He came finally to a junction where there waited a older boy in\ngreen-fringed black robes, silently reading a textbook, on the path\nthat anyone would pick if they wanted to intercept someone going\nfrom the healer's chambers to the Great Hall.",
      "Harry was wearing the Cloak of Invisibility, of course, he'd put\nit on after leaving the office, rendering himself immune to almost\nall forms of magical detection. There was no point in making it\neasy for anyone trying to find him and kill him. And Harry was\nalmost set to continue past without bothering to find out what was\ngoing on, when he recognized the Slytherin boy's face.",
      "Realization dawned on Harry then. Of course, one of the students\nwho had stayed in school over the Easter holiday would naturally\nhave been -",
      "\"You were waiting for me,\" Harry said out loud, without removing\nthe Cloak.",

You\nwouldn't have to make excuses for why Lesath was helping you, you\ncould just say you were calling in the debt from rescuing him from\nbullies, there were six witnesses to that.

The Grangers had hardly left with Madam Pomfrey before the\nDefense Professor had knocked upon the door to her office and then\nentered without waiting for her answer, and spoken before she could\nsay a word. Part of Minerva wondered distantly whether Harry Potter\nhad picked up that habit from his Defense Professor, being unaware\nof others' pain when there was something else on his mind, or if it\nwas only a childish flaw which this man had somehow failed to grow\nout of.",
      "\"Mr. Potter has ceased guarding Miss Granger's body,\" she said,\nputting some of the chill she felt into her voice. She felt certain\nthat the Defense Professor was not experiencing as much grief as\nshe was, the man had spoken not a single word of Hermione Granger.\nFor him to put demands on her - \"I believe he has gone\ndown to dinner.\"",
      "\"I am not asking after the boy's physical state! Have\nyou - has he -\" Professor Quirrell made a sharp gesture, as though\nto indicate a concept for which he had no words.",
      "\"Not particularly,\" she said. She was around thirty seconds away\nfrom ordering the Defense Professor out of her office.",
      "Professor Quirrell began to pace within the small confines of\nher office. \"Miss Granger was the only one whose worries he truly\nheeded - with her gone - all checks on the boy's recklessness are\nremoved.

To what end? Snape? A walking disaster. Dumbledore? Pfah.\nEvents are already set for catastrophe, they must be steered along\nsome course they would not naturally go. Who might Mr. Potter heed,\nwho would not ordinarily speak to him? Cedric Diggory has taught\nhim, but what would Mr. Diggory say in advice? An unknown. Mr.\nPotter spent long in speech with Remus Lupin. To him I have paid\nlittle heed. Would Lupin know the words to speak, the act which\nmust be done, the sacrifice which must be made to change the boy's\ncourse?\" Professor Quirrell whirled on her. \"Did Remus Lupin\ncomfort those in grief or stay those moved to rash deeds, during\nhis time with the Order of the Phoenix?\"",
      "\"It is not a poor thought,\" she said slowly. \"I believe that Mr.\nLupin was often a voice of restraint to James Potter in his\nHogwarts days.\"",
      "\"James Potter,\" said Professor Quirrell, his eyes narrowing.\n\"The boy is not much like James Potter. Are you confident in the\nsuccess of this plan? No, that is the wrong question, we are not\nlimited to a single plan. Are you certain that this plan will be\nenough, that we need essay no others? Asked in such\nfashion, the question answers itself. The path leading to disaster\nmust be averted along every possible point of intervention.\" The\nDefense Professor had resumed pacing the confines of her office,\nreaching one wall, turning on his heel, pacing to the other.",

      "\"You.\" Professor Quirrell spun, and she found herself\ngazing directly into eyes of icy blue. \"You would be the\nfirst one I would think of after Miss Granger, to stay the boy from\na folly. Have you already done your utmost? Of course you have\nnot.\"",
      "How dare he suggest that. \"If you have nothing more to\nsay, Professor, then you will go.\"",

      "\"Yes, in fact. Now -\"",
      "Pure magic, pure power crashed into the room like a flash of\nlightning, like a thunderclap echoing about her ears that deafened\nher other senses, the papers on her desk blown aside not by any\nconjured wind but by the sheer raw force of arcane might.",
      "Then the power subsided, leaving only Hermione Granger's death\ncertificates drifting down through the air to the floor.",
      "\"I am David Monroe, who fought Voldemort,\" the man said, still\nin mild tones. \"Heed my words. The boy cannot be allowed to\ncontinue in this state of mind. He will become dangerous.\nIt is possible that you have already done everything you can. Yet I\nfind this a very rare event indeed, and more often said than done.\nI suspect rather that you have only done what you customarily do. I\ncannot truly comprehend what drives others to break their bounds,\nsince I never had them. People remain surprisingly passive when\nfaced with the prospect of death. Fear of public ridicule or losing\none's livelihood is more likely to drive men to extremes and the\nbreaking of their customary habits. On the other side of the war,\nthe Dark Lord had excellent results from the Cruciatus Curse,\njudiciously used on Marked servants who cannot escape punishment\nexcept by success, with no reasonable efforts accepted. Imagine\ntheir state of mind within yourself, and ask yourself whether you\nhave truly done all that you can to wrench Harry Potter\nfrom his course.\"",
      "\"I am a Gryffindor and not much given to being moved by fear,\"\nshe snapped back. \"You will exercise courtesy within my\noffice!\"",
      "\"I find fear an excellent motivation, and indeed it is fear that\nmoves me now. You-Know-Who, for all his horror, still abided by\ncertain boundaries. It is my professional judgment, speaking as a\nlearned wizard almost on par with Dumbledore or\nHe-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, that the boy could join the ranks of\nthose whose rituals are inscribed upon the tombstones of countries.\nThis is not an idle worry, McGonagall, I have already heard words\nto produce the gravest apprehensions.\"",
      "\"Are you mad? You think that Mr. Potter could - this is\nridiculous. Mr. Potter cannot possibly -\"",
      "A wordless image crossed her mind of a patch of glass on a steel\nball.",
      "\"- Mr. Potter would not do such a thing!\"",
      "\"His deliberate choice is not required. Wizards rarely set out\nto invoke their own dooms. Mr. Potter may not strike you as\nmalicious. Does he strike you as reckless once he is resolved upon\na goal? I say again that I have specific reason for the gravest\npossible concerns!\"",
      "\"Have you spoken to the Headmaster of this?\" she said\nslowly.",
      "\"That would be worse than pointless. Dumbledore cannot reach the\nboy. At best he is wise enough to know this and make things no\nworse. I lack the requisite frame of mind. You are the one\nwho - but I see that you still look for others to save you.\" The\nDefense Professor turned from her, and strode to the door. \"I think\nI shall consult with Severus Snape. The man may be a walking\ndisaster, but he knows the fact, and he may possess a greater\nunderstanding of that boy's mood. As for you, madam, imagine\nyourself at the end of your life, knowing that Britain - but no,\nBritain is not your true country, is it? Imagine yourself at the\nend of your life as the darkness eats through the fading walls of\nHogwarts, knowing that your students will die with you, remembering\nthis day and realizing there was something else you could have\ndone.\""

      "Harry had walked into the Great Hall, looked around only once,\ngrabbed enough calories to sustain himself, walked out, put on his\nCloak again and found a small random corner in which to eat. Seeing\nthe students at their tables -",
      "Feeling revulsion when you look at other humans is not a\ngood sign, Hufflepuff said. It's not reasonable to blame\nthem for having not had your opportunities to learn what you've\nlearned. Inaction in emergencies has nothing to do with people\nbeing selfish. Normalcy bias, like that plane crash in\nTener-something where a few people ran out and escaped but most\npeople just sat in their seats not moving while their plane was\nliterally on fire. Look at how long you took to really\nstart moving.",
      "It serves no useful purpose to hate, said Gryffindor.\nIt's just going to damage your altruism.",
      "Try to figure out a training method you could use to prevent\nthis from happening next time, said Ravenclaw.",
      "I'll go ahead and register the experimental prediction,\nsaid Slytherin, that we'll always observe exactly what would be\npredicted on the hypothesis that people cannot be saved, cannot be\ntaught, and will never help us with anything important. Also, we\nneed some way of keeping track of all the times I'm right.",
      "Harry ignored the voices in his head and just ate slices of\ntoast as fast as he could. It wasn't proper nutrition as a general\npolicy, but one-time exceptions wouldn't hurt so long as he made\nthem up the next day.",
      "In mid-bite, the blazing silver silhouette of a phoenix flew in\nfrom nowhere and said, in the voice of a tired old man, \"Please\nremove your Cloak, Harry, I have a letter to deliver to you.\"",
      "Harry coughed for a bit, swallowed some toast which had gone\ndown the wrong way, stood up, took off the Cloak of Invisibility,\nsaid aloud \"Tell Dumbledore I said fine,\" and then sat down and\ncontinued to eat his toast.",
      "The toast had all gone by the time Albus Dumbledore walked up to\nHarry's nook, carrying folded sheets of paper in his hand; real\npaper, with lines, not wizard's parchment.",
      "\"Is that -\" Harry said.",
      "\"From your father, and from your mother,\" said the old wizard.\nWordlessly, Dumbledore handed over the folded sheets, and\nwordlessly Harry accepted them. The old wizard hesitated, then said\nquietly, \"The Defense Professor has told me to restrain my counsel,\nand I thought the same thing myself when given time to think. I\nhave always taken too long to learn the virtues of silence. But if\nI am mistaken, you need only say the word -\"",
      "\"You're not mistaken,\" Harry said. He looked down at the folded,\nlined papers, feeling the sickness in his gut that was how his body\nindicated a strong pessimistic prediction. His parents wouldn't\nactually disown him, and there wasn't much they could do\nto him (some part of himself was still afraid in a very visceral\nway of television privileges being taken away, no matter how little\nsense that made now). But he had stepped outside the role that\nparents would expect of children who, in their internal beliefs,\nwere lower on the pecking order. It would be stupid to expect\nanything except complete indignant fury, all-out righteous rage,\nwhen you acted like that to someone who thought they were dominant\nover you.",
      "\"After you read it,\" the Headmaster said, \"I believe that you\nshould come to the Great Hall at once, Harry. There is an\nannouncement which you will wish to hear.\"",
      "\"I'm not interested in funerals -\"",
      "\"No. Not that. Please, Harry, come as soon as you are done\nreading, and do so without your Cloak. Will you?\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "The old wizard left.",
      "Harry had to force himself to open up the letter. The important\nthing was keeping your vulnerable friends and relations out of\nharm's way, it might be a cliche but so far as Harry could tell the\nlogic was valid. Damaged relationships could be repaired later.",
      "The first letter said, in script handwriting that required a\ncareful focus for Harry to read,",
      "Son,",
      "No matter what you've read in books, keeping us out of\nharm's way is not as important as having adults\nwho can help when you're in trouble. You decided without giving us\na word in edgewise that we'd abandon you because of your 'dark\nside'. The ghost of Shakespeare knows that I've seen things in this\nlast year that were not dreamt of in my philosophy - sometimes I\nwonder if your Mum isn't just humoring me and the authorities took\nyou away when I started thinking you were a magic-user - so I can't\ndeny that it's possible you've managed to develop\nsome... I'm not quite sure what to call it, but 'dark side' seems\npremature if we don't know what's happening. Are you sure it's not\na burgeoning telepathic talent and you're just picking up on the\nminds of other wizards around you? Their thoughts might seem evil\nto a child who grew up in a saner civilization. These are\nungrounded speculations, I admit, but you shouldn't jump to\nconclusions either.",
      "The two most important things I have to tell you are this.\nFirst, son, I have every confidence in your\nability to stay on the Light Side of the Force so long as you\nchoose to, and I have every confidence that you will choose to. If\nthere's some evil spirit whispering horrible suggestions in your\nears, just ignore the suggestions. I do feel the\nneed to emphasize that you should exercise special caution to\nignore this evil spirit even if it is suggesting what seem like\nwonderful creative ideas and I hope I do not need to remind you\nabout the Incident with the Science Project which would, I admit,\nmake a deal more sense if you were struggling with demonic\npossession.",
      "The second thing I have to say is that you do not need to\nfear that Mum or I are going to abandon you because of your 'dark\nside'. We may not have expected you to gain magical powers or\ndevelop an affinity for black magic, but we did expect you to\nbecome a teenager. Which, if you think about it from your poor\nfather's perspective, is already a sufficiently worrying prospect\nregarding a child who, by the age of nine, had been party to the\nsummoning of a total of five fire engines. Children grow up. I\nwon't lie to you and say that you will feel as close to us at 20 as\nyou do now. But your Mum and I will feel just as close to you when\nwe are old and grey and bothering the nursing-home robots. Children\nalways grow up and away from their parents, and the parents always\nfollow them from behind, offering helpful advice. Children grow up,\nand their personalities change, and they do things that their\nparents wish they would not do, and they act disrespectfully toward\ntheir parents and have them hauled out of their magical schools,\nand the parents go on loving them anyway. It is Nature's way.\nThough in the event that you have not yet hit puberty and your\nteenage years are proportionately worse than this, we reserve the\nright to reconsider this sentiment.",
      "No matter what is happening, remember that we love you and\nwill always love you no matter what. I don't know if our love has\nany magical power under your rules, but if it does, don't hesitate\nto call on it.",
      "With all of this said... Harry, what you did there is not\nacceptable. I think you know that. And I also know that it is not\nthe time to lecture you on it. But you must write and tell us what\nis happening. I can understand very well why you'd want us taken\nout of your school at once, and I know we can't force you to do\nanything, but please, Harry, be reasonable and realize how\nterrified we must be.",
      "I would like to tell you that you are absolutely forbidden\nto mess around with any magic that the adults around you consider\nthe least bit unsafe, but for all I know, the teachers at your\nschool are giving everyone lessons in advanced necromancy every\nMonday. Please, please exercise as much caution as your situation\npermits, whatever your situation may be. Despite your very hurried\nsummary we don't have the slightest idea what is happening and I\nhope that you will write us as much as you can. It is clear that\nyou are, at least in some ways, growing up, and I will\ntry not to act like the children's-book parent who\nonly makes things worse - though I hope you appreciate how hard\nthis is - and your Mum has said a number of frightening things to\nme about how wizardry stays secret and how I might get\nyou into trouble by making waves. I cannot tell you to\navoid anything unsafe, because your school is unsafe and your\nHeadmaster will not let you leave. I can't tell you that you\nshouldn't take responsibility for anything happening around you,\nbecause for all I know there are other children in trouble. But\nremember that it is not your moral responsibility\nto protect any adults, their place is to protect you, and every\ngood adult would agree with that. Please write and tell us more as\nsoon as you can.",
      "Both of us are desperate to help. If there is anything at\nall that we can do, please let us know at once. There is nothing\nwhich can happen to us which would be worse than learning that\nsomething had happened to you.",
      "Love,Dad.",
      "The last page said only,",
      "You promised me that you wouldn't let magic take you away\nfrom me. I didn't raise you to be a boy who would break a promise\nto his Mum. You must come back safely, because you\npromised.",
      "Love,Mum.",
      "Slowly, Harry lowered the letters and began to walk towards the\nGreat Hall. His hands were shaking, his whole body was shaking, and\nit seemed to be taking a very great deal of effort not to cry;\nwhich he knew wordlessly that he must not do. He hadn't cried\nthrough all of the day. And he wouldn't cry. Crying was the same as\nadmitting defeat. And this wasn't over. So he wouldn't cry.",
      "The food served in the Great Hall that evening was plain that\nnight, toast and butter and jam, water and orange juice, oatmeal\nand other simple fare, without dessert. Some students had worn\nsimple black robes without their House colors. Others had still\nworn theirs. It should have been cause for argument, but there was\ninstead a quietness, the sound of people eating without talking. It\ntook two sides to make a debate, and one of the sides, this night,\nwas not much interested in debating.",
      "Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall sat at the Head Table and\ndid not eat. She should have. Perhaps she would in a short while.\nBut she could not force herself to do it now.",
      "For a Gryffindor there was only one path. It had taken Minerva\nonly a short time to remember that, when after the Defense\nProfessor's urgings her mind had stayed empty of clever plots to\ntry. That was not a Gryffindor's way; or perhaps she ought to say\nonly that it was not her way, Albus did seem to try his\nhand at plotting... and yet when she thought back on their history,\nthere were no plots at the moment of crisis, no cleverness and\ngames in the last resort. For Albus Dumbledore, as for her, the\nrule in extremis was to decide what was the right thing to\ndo, and do it no matter the cost to yourself. Even if it meant\nbreaking your bounds, or changing your role, or letting go of your\npicture of yourself. That was the last resort of Gryffindor.",
      "Through a side entrance of the Great Hall she saw Harry Potter\nquietly slip in.",
      "It was time.",
      "Professor Minerva McGonagall rose from her chair, straightened\nthe worn point on her hat, walked slowly to the lectern before the\nHead Table.",
      "The sounds in the Great Hall, already muted, fell away entirely\nas all students turned to look at her.",
      "\"By now you have all heard,\" she said, her voice not quite\nsteady. That Hermione Granger is dead. She didn't say\nthose words aloud, since they had all heard. \"Somehow, a troll was\ninfiltrated into the castle Hogwarts without alarm from our ancient\nwards. Somehow this troll succeeded in injuring a student, without\nalarm from the wards until the point of her death. Investigations\nare underway to determine how this has occurred. The Board of\nGovernors is meeting to determine how Hogwarts will respond. In due\ntime justice shall be served. Meanwhile there is another matter of\njustice, which must be handled at once. George Weasley, Fred\nWeasley, please come forward to stand before us all.\"",
      "The Weasley twins exchanged glances where they sat at the\nGryffindor table, and then stood up and walked toward her, slowly,\nreluctantly; and Minerva realized then that the Weasley twins\nthought that they were to be expelled.",
      "They honestly thought that she would expel them.",
      "That was what the picture of Professor McGonagall who lived in\nher head had wrought.",
      "The Weasley twins walked over to the lectern, looking up at her\nwith faces that were frightened, but resolute; and she felt\nsomething in her heart break a little further.",
      "\"I am not going to expel you,\" she said, and was saddened\nfurther by the surprised look on their faces. \"Fred Weasley, George\nWeasley, turn and face your classmates, let them see you.\"",
      "Still looking surprised, the Weasley twins did so.",
      "She drew up all the steel in her heart, and said what was\nright.",
      "\"I am ashamed,\" said Minerva McGonagall, \"of the events of this\nday. I am ashamed that there were only two of you. Ashamed of what\nI have done to Gryffindor. Of all the Houses, it should have been\nGryffindor to help when Hermione Granger was in need, when Harry\nPotter called for the brave to aid him. It was true, a seventh-year\ncould have held back a mountain troll while searching for Miss\nGranger. And you should have believed that the Head of House\nGryffindor,\" her voice broke, \"would have believed in you. If you\ndisobeyed her to do what was right, in events she had not foreseen.\nAnd the reason you did not believe this, is that I have never shown\nit to you. I did not believe in you. I did not believe in the\nvirtues of Gryffindor itself. I tried to stamp out your defiance,\ninstead of training your courage to wisdom. Whatever the Sorting\nHat saw in me that led it to place me in Gryffindor, I have\nbetrayed it. I have offered my resignation to the Headmaster as\nDeputy Headmistress and as the Head of House Gryffindor.\"",
      "There were cries of shock and dismay, and not only from the\nGryffindor Table, as Harry's heart froze within his chest. Harry\nneeded to run forward, say something, he hadn't meant for\nthis to -",
      "Minerva took another breath, and continued. \"However, the\nHeadmaster has declined to accept my resignation,\" she said. \"So I\nwill continue to serve, and try to undo what I have wrought.\nSomehow I must find a way to teach my students how to do what is\nright. Not what is safe, not what is easy, not what we are told to\ndo. If all I can teach you is to turn in your essays on time, there\nmight as well not be a House Gryffindor. This road will be more\ndifficult for me, and maybe for all of us. But I know now that\nbefore I was only taking the easy path.\"",
      "She stepped down from the lectern, moved down to where the\nWeasley twins stood.",
      "\"Fred Weasley, George Weasley,\" she said. \"The two of you have\nnot always done what is right. The path of wisdom does not lie in\nflagrant and needless defiance of authority. And yet today you\nproved to be the last of our House to survive my mistakes. Because\nit was the right thing to do, you defied a threat of expulsion and\nrisked your lives to face a mountain troll. For your astounding\ncourage that honors your House to have you, I award each of you two\nhundred points for Gryffindor.\"",
      "Again the look of shock on their faces, again the pain like a\nknife through her heart.",
      "She turned to face the other students.",
      "\"I will not award any points to Ravenclaw,\" she said. \"I suspect\nthat Mr. Potter would not want them. If I am wrong, he may correct\nme and take as many House points as he pleases. But for whatever it\nis worth, Mr. Potter, I am,\" her voice faltered, \"I am sorry -\"",
      "\"Stop!\u202f\" Harry screamed, and then, again, \"Stop.\" The\nword sticking in his throat. \"You don't have to, Professor.\"\nSomething inside him was twisting, threatening to split him open,\nlike a giant's hands wrenching at him to tear him in half. \"And,\nand you shouldn't forget Susan Bones, and Ron Weasley - they also\nhelped, they should get House points too -\"",
      "\"Miss Bones and the young Weasley?\" said Professor McGonagall.\n\"Rubeus said nothing of that - what did they do?\"",
      "\"Miss Bones tried to stun Mr. Hagrid when he tried to\nstop me, and Mr. Weasley shot Neville when Neville tried to stop\nme. They should both get points, and, and so should Neville,\" Harry\nhadn't thought to imagine it before, the way Neville must be\nfeeling now, but the instant he'd thought, he knew, \"because\nNeville tried to do something, even if it wasn't the right thing,\ndoing what's right is the second lesson, you can start\npracticing that after you learn to do anything at all -\"",
      "\"Ten points to Hufflepuff, Miss Bones,\" Professor McGonagall\nsaid, her voice breaking in the middle. \"Ten points to Gryffindor,\nRon Weasley, your family has done itself exceeding proud, this day.\nAnd ten points to Hufflepuff for Neville Longbottom, for standing\nup to Mr. Potter and doing what he thought was right -\"",
      "\"You shouldn't!\u202f\" screamed a young voice from the\nHufflepuff table, followed by a single choking sound.",
      "Harry looked there, and then quickly looked back at Professor\nMcGonagall and said, as steadily as he could, \"Neville's right,\nactually, you can't award literally zero points for the part where\nyou get the action correct, that sends the wrong message too, but\nhe was halfway there so it could be five points instead.\"",
      "Professor McGonagall looked, for a moment, like she couldn't\nthink of what to say; but then her eyes went to Neville's place at\nthe table, and she said, \"As you wish, Mr. Potter. What is it, Miss\nBones?\"",
      "Harry looked and saw that Susan Bones had stepped forward,\nwiping at her own eyes, and the Hufflepuff girl said, \"Actually -\nProfessor McGonagall - General Potter didn't see it - but Captain\nWeasley and I weren't the only ones who tried to get in Mr.\nHagrid's way, after he ran out. Before some of the older students\nstopped us. But we managed to slow Mr. Hagrid down a minute, so\nGeneral Potter could get away.\"",
      "\"You've got to give them points too,\" said Ron Weasley from the\nGryffindor table. \"Or I won't take any.\"",
      "\"Who else?\" said Professor McGonagall, her voice a bit\nunsteady.",
      "Seven other children stood up.",
      "What was that our Slytherin side was saying about predicting\nnothing would ever work? said Hufflepuff.",
      "Something in Harry cracked, so that he had to exert all his\nforce to hold himself together.",
      "When all had been said, and all had been done, Minerva went to\nwhere Harry Potter stood. Though it was not her greatest skill she\ncast a ward about them to blur vision, and muffled sounds with\nanother thought.",
      "\"You, you didn't have to -\" said Harry Potter. \"You shouldn't\nhave said -\" He sounded like he was choking. \"P-Professor,\neverything I said to you was hurtful, and hateful, and wrong -\"",
      "\"I already knew that, Harry,\" she said. \"Even so, I wished to do\nbetter.\" There was a feeling of lightness in her chest, much as one\nmight experience after stepping off a cliff, when your legs no\nlonger had to hold your body upright. She wasn't sure she could do\nthis, she did not know the way; and yet for the first time it\nseemed possible that Hogwarts wouldn't become a sad ghost of its\nformer self, when she became its Headmistress.",
      "Harry stared at her, then made a odd noise that sounded like it\nhad been forced from his throat, and covered his face in his\nhands.",
      "So she knelt down, and hugged him. It might go wrong, but it\nmight also go right, and she would not let that uncertainty stop\nher; it was time she began to learn a Gryffindor's courage, so that\nshe could teach it in turn.",
      "\"I had a sister once,\" she whispered. Just that, and nothing\nmore.",
      "Just to make sure, said some part of Harry, while the\nrest of him sobbed into Professor McGonagall's arms, this\ndoesn't mean we've accepted Hermione's death, right?",
      "NO said all the rest of him, every part of his mind in\nunanimous agreement, warmth and cold and a hidden place of steel.\nNever, ever, forever.",
      "And an ancient wizard to whom that ward meant nothing gazed upon\nthem both, the witch and the weeping young wizard. Albus Dumbledore\nwas smiling with a strange sad look in his eyes, like someone who\nhas taken one more step toward a foreseen destination.",
      "The Defense Professor watched them both, the woman and the\ncrying boy. His eyes were very cold, and very calculating.",
      "He did not think that this would be enough.",
      "It wasn't until the next morning that it was discovered that\nHermione Granger's body was missing."

      "The first meeting:",
      "At 6:07am on April 17th, 1992 the Sun was just rising above the\nhorizon as seen from the castle Hogwarts, filtering in through\ndrawn curtains in the Ravenclaw first-year boys' dorm to provide a\ngentle light, red-orange for dawn and little-changed by the white\nfabric covering the windows, not yet waking boys more accustomed to\nwinter's schedule.",
      "In one bed among many, Harry Potter slept the sleep of the just\nexhausted.",
      "Quietly the door opened.",
      "Quietly a figure walked across the floor.",
      "That figure came to Harry Potter's bed.",
      "The figure laid a hand on the shoulder of the sleeping boy, who\nstarted and shrieked.",
      "No others heard.",
      "\"Mr. Potter,\" the small man squeaked, \"the Headmaster has\nrequested your presence immediately.\"",
      "Slowly the boy sat up in bed, his hands momentarily fiddling\nbeneath the covers. He'd expected to feel much worse, waking up\nthis morning. It felt... wrong, that his brain functioned now, that\nhis thoughts still moved, that he wasn't incapacitated with weeping\nfor at least a week. The boy knew that it wouldn't have been an\nadaptive response, for brains to evolve to do that. His dark side,\ncertainly, would not do that. Even so, it still felt wrong to be\nalive and lucid, this morning.",
      "But his resolution to revive Hermione Granger felt - sufficient,\nlike he was already doing the right thing, bent on the right path,\nand she would be brought back, and that was all there was to it;\ngrief would have been giving up. There was nothing left to decide,\nno ambiguity, no conflict to tear at him, and no need to remember\nwhat he'd seen -",
      "\"I'll get dressed,\" Harry said.",
      "Professor Flitwick looked rather reluctant, but said in his high\nvoice, \"The Headmaster specified you were to be brought to his\noffice directly and without pause, Mr. Potter. I'm sorry.\"",
      "Less than a minute later - Professor Flitwick had sent him\nstraight to the Headmaster's office through the Hogwarts internal\nFloo - Harry found himself, still in his pajamas, facing Albus\nDumbledore. The Deputy Headmistress was also sitting in another\nchair, and the Potions Master lurked nearby amid the weird devices,\ncaught in a gaping yawn just as Harry had entered through the\nfireplace.",
      "\"Harry,\" the Headmaster said without preamble, \"before I say\nwhat I must say next, I tell you that Hermione Granger did truly\ndie. The wards recorded it and informed me. The very stones spoke\nthat a witch had died. I tested her body where it lay and those\nwere Hermione Granger's true mortal remains, not any doll or\nlikeness. There is no way known to wizardry by which death may be\nundone. All this being said, Hermione Granger's remains are now\nmissing from the storeroom where they were placed, and where you\nguarded them. Did you take them, Harry Potter?\"",
      "\"No,\" Harry said, narrowing his eyes. A glance showed him that\nSeverus was watching him intently.",
      "Dumbledore's gaze was also keen, though not unfriendly. \"Is\nHermione Granger's body in your possession?\"",
      "\"No.\"",
      "\"Do you know where it is?\"",
      "\"No.\"",
      "\"Do you know who took it?\"",
      "\"No,\" Harry said, then hesitated. \"Besides the obvious\nprobabilistic speculations which are not based upon any specific\nknowledge of mine.\"",
      "The old wizard nodded. \"Do you know why it was taken?\"",
      "\"No. Besides the obvious speculations etcetera.\"",
      "\"What would those be?\" Sharp the ancient eyes.",
      "\"If the enemy can notice you running off to consult the Weasley\ntwins during class after Hermione was arrested, and find out about\nthat magic map you said was stolen, then the enemy can wonder why I\nwas guarding Hermione Granger's body. My turn. Did you arrange for\nHermione's death in hopes of getting the money back from\nLucius?\"",

      "\"I did not know. As for suspicions, I placed her in the most\nstrongly defended position I could, against Voldemort. I did not\nwill her death, nor allow it, nor plan to benefit from it, Harry\nPotter. Now show me your pouch.\"",
      "\"It's in my trunk -\" Harry began.",
      "\"Severus,\" said the old wizard, and the Potions Master moved\nforward. \"Check his trunk as well, every compartment.\"",
      "\"My trunk has wards.\"",
      "Severus Snape grinned mirthlessly and strode into the green\nflame.",
      "Dumbledore took out his long dark-grey wand and began to wave it\nclose around Harry's hair, looking like a Muggle using a\nmetal-detector. Before he had reached as far as Harry's neck,\nDumbledore stopped.",
      "\"The gem upon your ring,\" Dumbledore said. \"It is no longer a\nclear diamond. It is brown, the color of Hermione Granger's eyes,\nand the color of her hair.\"",
      "A sudden tension filled the room.",
      "\"That's my father's rock,\" Harry said. \"Transfigured the same as\nbefore. I just did it to remember Hermione -\"",
      "\"I must be sure. Take off that ring, Harry, and place it upon my\ndesk.\"",
      "Slowly, Harry did so, removing the gem and setting the ring off\nto the other side of the desk.",
      "Dumbledore pointed his wand at the gem and -",
      "A large, undistinguished grey rock jumped into the air from the\nforce of its sudden expansion, hit some invisible barrier in the\nair above, and then fell with a loud crack upon the Headmaster's\ndesk,",
      "\"There's another half-hour of work for me, Transfiguring it\nagain,\" Harry said evenly.",
      "Dumbledore resumed his examination. Harry had to remove his left\nshoe, and take off the toe-ring that was his emergency portkey if\nsomeone kidnapped him and took him outside the wards of Hogwarts\n(and didn't put up anti-Apparition, anti-portkey, anti-phoenix, and\nanti-time-looping wards, which Severus had warned Harry that any\ninner-circle Death Eater would certainly do). It was verified that\nthe magic radiating from the toe-ring was indeed the magic of a\nportkey, and not the magic of a Transfiguration. The rest of Harry\nwas deemed clear.",
      "Not long after, the Potions Master returned, bearing Harry's\npouch, and several other magical things which had been in Harry's\ntrunk, which the Headmaster also examined, one by one, even to all\nthe items remaining within the healer's kit.",
      "\"Can I go now?\" Harry said when it was all done, putting as much\ncold as he could into his voice. He took up his pouch, and began\nthe process of feeding the grey rock into it. The empty ring went\nback on his finger.",
      "The old wizard breathed out, slipping his wand back into his\nsleeve. \"I am sorry,\" he said. \"I had to know. Harry...\nthe Dark Lord has taken Hermione Granger's remains, it seems. I\ncannot think of anything he would gain thereby, except to send her\ncorpse against you as an Inferius. Severus shall give you certain\npotions to keep about your person. Be warned now, and be prepared\nfor when you must do what must be done.\"",
      "\"Will the Inferius have Hermione's mind?\"",
      "\"No -\"",
      "\"Then it's not her. Can I go? At least to change out of my\npyjamas.\"",
      "\"There is other news, but I shall be brief. The wards of\nHogwarts record that no foreign creature has entered, and that it\nwas the Defense Professor who killed Hermione Granger.\"",
      "\"Um,\" Harry said.",
      "Thought 1: But I saw the troll kill Hermione.",
      "Thought 2: Professor Quirrell Memory-Charmed me and set up\nthe scene that Dumbledore saw when he arrived.",
      "Thought 3: Professor Quirrell can't do that, his magic can't\ntouch mine. I saw that in Azkaban -",
      "Thought 4: Can I trust those memories?",
      "Thought 5: There was clearly some sort of debacle at\nAzkaban, we wouldn't have needed a rocket if Professor Quirrell\nhadn't fallen unconscious, and why'd he be unconscious if not\n-",
      "Thought 6: Did I ever actually go to Azkaban at\nall?",
      "Thought 7: I clearly practiced controlling Dementors at some\npoint before I scared that Dementor in the Wizengamot. And\nthat was in the newspapers.",
      "Thought 8: Am I accurately remembering the\nnewspapers?",
      "\"Um,\" Harry said again. \"That spell seriously ought to be\nUnforgiveable. You think Professor Quirrell could have\nMemory-Charmed -\"",
      "\"No. I went back through time and placed certain instruments to\nrecord Hermione's last battle, which I could not quite bear to\nwatch in my own person.\" The old wizard looked very grim indeed.\n\"Your guess was right, Harry Potter. Voldemort sabotaged everything\nwe gave Hermione to protect her. Her broomstick lay dead in her\nhands. Her invisibility cloak did not conceal her. The troll walked\nin the sunlight unharmed; it was no stray creature, but a weapon\npure and aimed. And it was indeed the troll who killed her, with\nstrength alone, so that my wards and webs to detect hostile magics\nwent for naught. The Defense Professor never crossed her path.\"",
      "Harry swallowed, shut his eyes, and thought. \"So this was an\nattempted frame on Professor Quirrell. Somehow. It does seem to be\nthe enemy's modus operandi. Troll eats Hermione Granger,\ncheck the wards, oh look actually the Defense Professor did it,\nsame as last year... no. No, that can't be right.\"",
      "\"Why not, Mr. Potter?\" said the Potions Master. \"It seems\nobvious enough to me -\"",
      "\"That's the problem.\"",
      "The enemy is smart.",
      "Slowly the fog of sleep was drifting out of Harry's mind, and\nafter a full night's sleep his brain could see the things which\nhadn't been obvious the day before.",
      "Under standard literary convention... the enemy wasn't supposed\nto look over what you'd done, sabotage the magic items you'd handed\nout, and then send out a troll rendered undetectable by some means\nthe heroes couldn't figure out even after the fact, so that you\nmight as well have not defended yourself at all. In a book, the\npoint-of-view usually stayed on the main characters. Having the\nenemy just bypass all the protagonists' work, as a result of\nplanning and actions taken out of literary sight, would be a\ndiabolus ex machina, and dramatically unsatisfying.",
      "But in real life the enemy would think that they were the main\ncharacter, and they would also be clever, and think things through\nin advance, even if you didn't see them do it. That was why\neverything about this felt so disjointed, with parts unexplained\nand seemingly inexplicable. How had Lucius felt, when Harry had\nthreatened Dumbledore with breaking Azkaban? How had the Aurors\nabove Azkaban felt, seeing the broomstick rise up on a torch of\nfire?",
      "The enemy is smart.",
      "\"The enemy knew perfectly well that you'd turn back time to\ncheck what really happened to Hermione, especially since the troll\ngetting into Hogwarts at all tells us that somebody can fool the\nwards.\" Harry shut his eyes, thinking harder, trying to put himself\ninto the enemy's shoes. Why would he, or his dark side, have done\nsomething like - \"We're meant to conclude that the enemy has\ncontrol of what the wards tell us. But that's actually something\nthe enemy can only do with difficulty, or under special conditions;\nthey're trying to create a false appearance of omnipotence.\"\nLike I would. \"Later, hypothetically, the wards show\nProfessor Sinistra killing someone. We think the wards are just\nbeing fooled again, but really, Professor Sinistra was Legilimized\nand she did do it.\"",
      "\"Unless that is precisely what the Dark Lord expects us to\nthink,\" said Severus Snape, his brow furrowed in concentration. \"In\nwhich case he does have control of the wards, and Professor\nSinistra will be innocent.\"",
      "\"Does the Dark Lord really use plots with that many\nlevels of meta -\"",
      "\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore and Severus.",
      "Harry nodded distantly. \"Then this could be a setup to either\nmake us think the wards are telling the truth when they're lying,\nor a setup to make us think the wards are lying when they're\ntelling the truth, depending on what level the enemy expects us to\nreason at. But if the enemy is planning to make us trust the wards\n- we would have trusted the wards anyway, if we'd been given no\nreason to distrust them. So there's no need to go to all the work\nof framing Professor Quirrell in a way that we would realize we\nwere intended to discover, just to trick us into going meta -\"",
      "\"Not so,\" said Dumbledore. \"If Voldemort has not fully mastered\nthe wards, then the wards had to believe that some Professor's hand\nwas at work. Else they would have cried out at Miss Granger's\ninjury, and not only upon her death.\"",
      "Harry reached up a hand and rubbed at his brow, just beneath his\nhair.",
      "Okay, serious question. If the enemy is that smart, why the\nheck am I still alive? Is it seriously that hard to poison someone,\nare there Charms and Potions and bezoars which can cure me of\nliterally anything that could be slipped into my breakfast?\nWould the wards record it, trace the magic of the\nmurderer?",
      "Could my scar contain the fragment of soul that's\nkeeping the Dark Lord anchored to the world, so he doesn't want to\nkill me? Instead he's trying to drive off all my friends to weaken\nmy spirit so he can take over my body? It'd explain the Parselmouth\nthing. The Sorting Hat might not be able to detect a\nlich-phylactery-thingy. Obvious problem 1, the Dark Lord is\nsupposed to have made his lich-phylactery-thingy in 1943 by killing\nwhatshername and framing Mr. Hagrid. Obvious problem 2, there's no\nsuch thing as souls.",
      "Though Dumbledore also thought that my blood was a key\ningredient in a ritual to restore the Dark Lord's full strength,\nwhich would require keeping me alive until then... now there's a\ncheery thought.",
      "\"Well...\" Harry said. \"I'm sure of one thing.\"",
      "\"And that is?\"",
      "\"Neville needs to be taken out of Hogwarts now. He's\nthe obvious next target and no first-year student can survive this\nlevel of offense. We're lucky Neville wasn't assassinated yesterday\nevening, the enemy doesn't have to wait until we're finished\nmourning to make their next move.\" Why didn't the enemy strike\nwhile we were distracted?",
      "Dumbledore exchanged glances with Severus, and then with the\nsuddenly tight expression of Professor McGonagall. \"Harry,\" said\nthe old wizard, \"if you send all your friends away yourself, that\nis just the same as if Voldemort -\"",
      "\"I will be fine I can do without Neville for a couple\nof extra months it's not like you were planning to make my friends\nstay here over the summer and that is just plain not sufficient\njustification to let him get killed! Professor McGonagall\n-\"",
      "\"I quite agree,\" said the Scottish witch. She frowned. \"I\nextremely agree. I agree to the point where... I'm having some\ntrouble figuring out how to express this, Albus...\"",
      "\"To the point where you're going to haul him out of there\nyourself, regardless of what anyone else says, because it's no\nexcuse to say you were only following orders if Neville gets\nkilled?\" Harry said.",
      "Professor McGonagall closed her eyes briefly. \"Yes, but surely\nthere ought to be some way to be responsible without threats of\nunilateral action.\"",
      "The Headmaster sighed. \"No need. Go, Minerva.\"",
      "\"Wait,\" the Potions Master said, just as Professor McGonagall,\nmoving rather swiftly, was taking a pinch of green dust from the\nFloo-vase. \"We should not call attention to the boy, as the\nHeadmaster called attention to the Weasley twins. It would be\nwiser, I think, if Mr. Longbottom's grandmother took him from\nHogwarts. Let him stay in his Common Room for now; the Dark Lord\ndoes not seem able to act so openly.\"",
      "There was another long exchange of glances among the four, and\nfinally Harry nodded, followed by Professor McGonagall.",
      "\"In that case,\" said Harry, \"I'm sure of one other thing.\"",
      "\"And that is?\" said Dumbledore.",
      "\"I very much need to visit the washroom, and I would also like\nto change out of these pyjamas.\"",
      "\"By the way,\" Harry said as he and the Headmaster emerged from\nFloo into the empty office of the Ravenclaw Head of House. \"One\nlast quick question I wanted to ask just you. That sword the\nWeasley twins pulled out of the Sorting Hat. That was the Sword of\nGryffindor, wasn't it?\"",
      "The old wizard turned, face neutral. \"What makes you think that,\nHarry?\"",
      "\"The Sorting Hat yelled Gryffindor! just before handing\nit out, the sword had a ruby pommel and gold letters on the blade,\nand the Latin script said Nothing better. Just a\nhunch.\"",
      "\"Nihil supernum,\" said the old wizard. \"That is not\nquite what it means.\"",
      "Harry nodded. \"Mmhm. What'd you do with it?\"",
      "\"I retrieved it from where it fell, and placed it in a secure\nplace,\" the old wizard said. He gave Harry a stern look. \"I hope\nyou are not greedy for it yourself, young Ravenclaw.\"",
      "\"Not at all, just want to make sure you're not keeping it\npermanently from its rightful wielders. So the Weasley twins are\nthe Heir of Gryffindor, then?\"",
      "\"The Heir of Gryffindor?\" Dumbledore said, looking surprised.\nThen the old wizard smiled, blue eyes twinkling brightly. \"Ah,\nHarry, Salazar Slytherin may have built a Chamber of Secrets into\nHogwarts, but Godric Gryffindor was not much given to such\nextravagances. We have seen only that Godric left his Sword to the\ndefense of Hogwarts, if a worthy student ever faced a foe they\ncould not defeat alone.\"",
      "\"That's not the same as saying no. Don't think I didn't notice\nthat you didn't actually say no.\"",
      "\"I did not live in those years, Harry, and I do not know all\nthat Godric Gryffindor may or may not have done -\"",
      "\"Do you in fact assign greater than fifty percent subjective\nprobability that there is something like a Heir of Gryffindor and\none or both Weasley twins are it. Yes or no, evasion means yes.\nYou're not going to succeed in distracting me, no matter how much I\nhave to go to the bathroom.\"",
      "The old wizard sighed. \"Yes, Fred and George Weasley are the\nHeir of Gryffindor. I beg you not to speak of it to them, not\nyet.\"",
      "Harry nodded, and turned to go. \"I'm surprised,\" Harry said. \"I\nread a little about Godric Gryffindor's historical life. The\nWeasley twins are... well, they're awesome in various ways, but\nthey don't seem much like the Godric in the history books.\"",
      "\"Only a man exceedingly proud and vain,\" Dumbledore said\nquietly, as he turned back to the Floo roaring up again with green\nflames, \"would believe that his heir should be like himself, rather\nthan like who he wished that he could be.\"",
      "The Headmaster stepped into green fire, and was gone.",
      "The second meeting (in a small cubby off the Hufflepuff\nCommon Room):",
      "Neville Longbottom's face was drawn up in anguish, as he spoke\nwith no one to hear, to the empty air.",
      "\"Seriously,\" the empty air said back to him. \"I'm wearing an\ninvisibility cloak with extra anti-detection charms just to walk\nthrough the hallways because I don't want to be killed. My\nparents would have me out of Hogwarts in an instant if the\nHeadmaster allowed it. Neville, your getting the heck out of\nHogwarts is common sense, it has nothing to do with -\"",
      "\"I betrayed you, General,\" Neville said, his voice around as\nhollow as any normal eleven-year-old boy could reasonably manage.\n\"I didn't even do it the Chaotic way. I conformed to authority and\ntried to make you conform to authority too. What's that you always\nsay, about how in the Chaos Legion, a soldier who can only obey\norders is useless?\"",
      "\"Neville,\" the empty air said firmly. The pressure of two hands,\nbeneath thin cloth, came firmly to bear on Neville's shoulders; and\nthe voice moved closer to him. \"You weren't blindly obeying\nauthority, you were trying to protect me. It's true that in this\nchaotic world, soldiers who can only follow rules and regulations\nare worthless. However, soldiers who follow rules for the sake of\nprotecting their friends are -\"",
      "\"Slightly better than worthless?\" Neville said bitterly.",
      "\"Significantly better than worthless. Neville, you made\nan error of judgment. It cost me around six seconds. Now it could\nbe that Hermione's injuries were just barely fatal, but even then,\nI don't think six seconds was actually enough time for the troll to\ntake an extra bite of Hermione. In the counterfactual world where\nyou didn't step in front of me, Hermione still died. Now, I could\nstand here listing out the first dozen ways that Hermione would be\nalive if I hadn't been stupid -\"",
      "\"You? You ran right out after her. I'm the one\nwho tried to stop you. It's my fault if it's anyone's,\" Neville\nsaid bitterly.",
      "The empty air went silent at this for a while.",
      "\"Wow,\" the empty air finally said. \"Wow. That puts a pretty\ndifferent perspective on things, I have to say. I'm going to\nremember this the next time I feel an impulse to blame myself for\nsomething. Neville, the term in the literature for this is\n'egocentric bias', it means that you experience everything about\nyour own life but you don't get to experience everything else that\nhappens in the world. There was way, way more going on than you\nrunning in front of me. You're going to spend weeks remembering\nthat thing you did there for six seconds, I can tell, but nobody\nelse is going to bother thinking about it. Other people spend a lot\nless time thinking about your past mistakes than you do, just\nbecause you're not the center of their worlds. I guarantee\nto you that nobody except you has even considered blaming\nNeville Longbottom for what happened to Hermione. Not for a\nfraction of a second. You are being, if you will pardon the phrase,\na silly-dilly. Now shut up and say goodbye.\"",
      "\"I don't want to say goodbye,\" Neville said. His voice was\ntrembling, but he managed not to cry. \"I want to stay here and\nfight with you against - against whatever's happening.\"",
      "The empty air moved closer to him, and embraced him in a hug,\nand Harry Potter's voice whispered, \"Tough luck.\""

      "The third meeting\n(10:31am, April 17th 1992)",
      "Spring had begun, the late-morning air still crisp with the\nleavings of winter. Daffodils had bloomed amid the sprouting grass\nof the forest, the gentle yellow petals with their golden hearts\ndangling limply from their dead, grayed stems, wounded or killed by\none of the sudden frosts that you often saw in April. In the\nForbidden Forest there would be stranger lifeforms, centaurs and\nunicorns at the least, and Harry had heard allegations of\nwerewolves. Though from what Harry had read of real-life\nwerewolves, that did not make the slightest bit of sense.",
      "Harry didn't venture anywhere near the border of the Forbidden\nForest, since there was no reason to take the risk. He walked\ninvisibly among the more ordinary life-forms of the permitted\nwoods, wand in hand, a broomstick strapped to his back for easier\naccess, just in case. He was not actually afraid; Harry thought it\nodd that he didn't feel afraid. The state of constant vigilance,\nreadiness for fight or flight, failed to feel burdensome or even\nabnormal.",
      "On the edges of the permitted woods Harry walked, his feet never\nstraying near the beaten path where he might be more easily found,\nnever leaving sight of Hogwarts's windows. Harry had set the alarm\nupon his mechanical watch to tell him when it was lunchtime, since\nhe couldn't actually look at his wrist, being invisible and all\nthat. It raised the question of how his eyeglasses worked while he\nwas wearing the Cloak. For that matter the Law of the Excluded\nMiddle seemed to imply that either the rhodopsin complexes in his\nretina were absorbing photons and transducing them to neural\nspikes, or alternatively, those photons were going straight through\nhis body and out the other side, but not both. It really did seem\nincreasingly likely that invisibility cloaks let you see outward\nwhile being invisible yourself because, on some fundamental level,\nthat was how the caster had - not wanted - but\nimplicitly believed - that invisibility should work.",
      "Whereupon you had to wonder whether anyone had tried Confunding\nor Legilimizing someone into implicitly and matter-of-factly\nbelieving that Fixus Everythingus ought to be an easy\nfirst-year Charm, and then trying to invent it.",
      "Or maybe find a worthy Muggleborn in a country that didn't\nidentify Muggleborn children, and tell them some extensive lies,\nfake up a surrounding story and corresponding evidence, so that,\nfrom the very beginning, they'd have a different idea of what magic\ncould do. Though apparently they'd still have to learn a number of\nprevious Charms before they became capable of inventing their\nown...",
      "It might not work. Surely there'd been some organically insane\nwizards who'd truly believed in their own possibility of godhood,\nand yet had failed to become god. But even the insane had probably\nbelieved the ascension spell ought to be some grandiose dramatic\nritual and not something you did with a carefully composed twitch\nof your wand and the incantation Becomus Goddus.",
      "Harry was already pretty sure it wouldn't be that easy. But then\nthe question was, why not? What pattern had his brain\nlearned? Could the reason be predicted in advance?",
      "A slight fringe of apprehension crept through Harry then, a\ntinge of worry, as he contemplated this question. The nameless\nconcern sharpened, grew greater -",
      "Professor Quirrell?",
      "\"Mr. Potter,\" a soft voice called from behind him.",
      "Harry spun, his hand going to the Time-Turner beneath his cloak;\nagain the principle of being ready to flee upon an instant's notice\nfelt only ordinary.",
      "Slowly, palms empty and turned outward, Professor Quirrell was\nwalking towards him within the forests' outskirts, coming from the\ngeneral direction of the Hogwarts castle.",
      "\"Mr. Potter,\" Professor Quirrell said again. \"I know that you're\nhere. You know that I know that you're here. I must speak to\nyou.\"",
      "Still Harry said nothing. Professor Quirrell hadn't actually\nsaid what this was about, and Harry's sunlit morning walk about the\nforest edge had produced a mood of silence within him.",
      "Professor Quirrell took a small step to the left, a step\nforward, another to the right. He tilted his head with a look of\ncalculation, and then he walked almost directly towards where Harry\nstood, halted a few paces off with the sense of doom enflamed to\nthe height of bearability.",
      "\"Are you still resolved upon your course?\" Professor Quirrell\nsaid. \"The same course you spoke of yesterday?\"",
      "Again Harry did not reply.",
      "Professor Quirrell sighed. \"There is much I have done for you,\"\nthe man said. \"Whatever else you may wonder of me, you cannot deny\nthat. I am calling in some of the debt. Talk to me, Mr.\nPotter.\"",
      "I don't feel like doing this right now, Harry thought;\nthen: Oh, right.",
      "Two hours later, after Harry had spun the Time-Turner once,\nnoted down the exact time and memorized his exact location, spent\nanother hour walking, went inside and told Professor McGonagall\nthat he was currently talking to the Defense Professor in the woods\noutside Hogwarts (just in case anything happened to him), walked\nfor a further hour, then returned to his original location exactly\none hour after he'd left and spun the Time-Turner again -",
      "\"What was that?\" Professor Quirrell said, blinking. \"Did you\njust -\"",
      "\"Nothing important,\" Harry said without pulling back the hood of\nhis invisibility cloak, or taking his hand from his Time-Turner.\n\"Yes, I'm still resolved. To be honest, I'm thinking I shouldn't\nhave said anything.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell inclined his head. \"A sentiment which shall\nserve you well in life. Is there anything which is liable to change\nyour mind?\"",
      "\"Professor, if I already knew about the existence of an\nargument which would change my decision -\"",
      "\"True, for the likes of us. But you would be surprised how often\nsomeone knows what they are waiting to hear, yet must wait to hear\nit said.\" Professor Quirrell shook his head. \"To put this in your\nterms... there is a true fact, known to me but not to you, of which\nI would like to convince you, Mr. Potter.\"",
      "Harry's eyebrows rose, though he realized in the next moment\nthat Professor Quirrell couldn't see it. \"That's in my terms, all\nright. Go ahead.\"",
      "\"The intention you have formed is far more dangerous than you\nrealize.\"",
      "Replying to this surprising statement did not take much thought\non Harry's part. \"Define dangerous, and tell me what you think you\nknow and how you think you know it.\"",
      "\"Sometimes,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"telling someone about a\ndanger can cause them to walk directly into it. I have no intention\nof having that happen this time. Do you expect me to tell you\nexactly what you must not do? Exactly why I am afraid?\" The man\nshook his head. \"If you were wizardborn, Mr. Potter, you would know\nto take it seriously, when a powerful magus tells you only to\nbeware.\"",
      "It would have been a lie to say that Harry was not annoyed, but\nhe also wasn't an idiot; so Harry said merely, \"Is there anything\nyou can tell me?\"",
      "Carefully, Professor Quirrell seated himself upon the grass, and\ntook out his wand, his hand assuming a position that Harry\nrecognized. Harry's breath caught.",
      "\"This is the last time that I shall be able to do this for you,\"\nProfessor Quirrell said quietly. Then the man began to speak words\nthat were strange, of no language Harry could recognize, intonation\nthat seemed not quite human, words which seemed to slip from\nHarry's memory even as he tried to grasp them, exiting from his\nmind as quickly as they entered.",
      "The spell took effect more slowly, this time. The trees seemed\nto darken, branches and leaves staining, as though seen through\nperfect sunglasses that faded and attenuated light without\ndistorting it. The blue bowl of the sky receded, the horizon which\nHarry's brain falsely assigned a finite distance pulling back as it\nturned gray, and darker gray. The clouds became translucent,\ntransparent, wisping away to let the darkness shine through.",
      "The forest shaded, faded, abated into blackness.",
      "The great sky river became visible once again, as Harry's eyes\nadjusted, became able to see the largest object which human eyes\ncould ever behold as more than a point, the surrounding Milky\nWay.",
      "And the stars, piercingly bright and yet remote, out of a great\ndepth.",
      "Professor Quirrell breathed deeply. Then he raised his wand\nagain (just barely visible, in the starlight without sun or moon)\nand tapped himself on the head with a sound like an egg\ncracking.",
      "The Defense Professor also faded away, became likewise\ninvisible.",
      "A tiny disk of grass, illuminated by not much light at all,\ndrifted unoccupied within empty space.",
      "Neither of them spoke for a time. Harry was content to look at\nthe stars, undistracted even by his own body. Whatever Professor\nQuirrell had called him here to say, it would be said in due\ntime.",
      "In due time, a voice spoke.",
      "\"There is no war here,\" said a soft voice emanating from within\nthe emptiness. \"No conflict and battle, no politics and betrayal,\nno death and no life. That is all for the folly of men. The stars\nare above such foolishness, untouched by it. Here there is peace,\nand silence eternal. So I once thought.\"",
      "Harry turned to look at where the voice originated, and saw only\nstars.",
      "\"So you once thought?\" Harry said, when no other words seemed to\nbe forthcoming.",
      "\"There is nothing above the folly of men,\" whispered the voice\nfrom the emptiness. \"There is nothing beyond the destructive powers\nof sufficiently intelligent idiocy, not even the stars themselves.\nI went to a great deal of trouble to make a certain golden plaque\nlast forever. I would not like to see it destroyed by human\nfolly.\"",
      "Again Harry's eyes reflexively darted toward where the voice\nshould have been, again saw only emptiness. \"I think I can reassure\nyou on that score, Professor. Nuclear weapons don't have a fireball\nextending out for... how far away is Pioneer 11? Somewhere around a\nbillion kilometers, maybe? Muggles talk about nuclear weapons\ndestroying the world, but what they actually mean is lightly\nwarming up some of Earth's surface. The Sun is a giant\nfusion reaction and it doesn't vaporize distant space\nprobes. The worst-case scenario for nuclear war wouldn't even come\nclose to destroying the Solar System, not that this is much of a\nconsolation.\"",
      "\"True while we speak of Muggles,\" said the soft voice amid\nstarlight. \"But what do Muggles know of true power? It is not they\nwho frighten me now. It is you.\"",
      "\"Professor,\" Harry said carefully, \"while I have to admit I've\nrolled a few critical failures in my life, there's a bit of\ndistance between that and missing a saving throw so hard that the\nPioneer 11 probe gets caught in the blast radius. There's no\nrealistic way to do that without blowing up the Sun. And before you\nask, our Sun is a main-sequence G-type star, it can't\nexplode. Any energy input would just increase the volume of the\nhydrogen plasma, the Sun doesn't have a degenerate core that could\nbe detonated. The Sun doesn't have enough mass to go supernova,\neven at the end of its lifespan.\"",
      "\"Such amazing things the Muggles have learned,\" the other voice\nmurmured. \"How stars live, how they are preserved from death, how\nthey die. And they never wonder if such knowledge might be\ndangerous.\"",
      "\"In all frankness, Professor, that particular thought has never\noccurred to me either.\"",
      "\"You are Muggleborn. I speak not of blood, I speak of how you\nspent your childhood years. There is a freedom of thought in that,\ntrue. But there is also wisdom in the caution of wizardkind. It has\nbeen three hundred and twenty-three years since the magical\nterritories of Sicily were ruined by one man's folly. Such\nincidents were more common in the years when Hogwarts was raised.\nCommoner still, in the aftertime of Merlin. Of the time before\nMerlin, little remains to study.\"",
      "\"There's around thirty orders of magnitude of difference between\nthat and blowing up the Sun,\" Harry observed, then caught himself.\n\"But that's a pointless quibble, sorry, blowing up a country would\nalso be bad, I agree. In any case, Professor, I don't plan on doing\nanything like that.\"",
      "\"Your choice is not required, Mr. Potter. If you had read more\nwizardborn novels and fewer Muggle stories, you would know. In\nserious literature the wizard whose foolishness threatens to\nunleash the Shambling Bone-Men will not be deliberately bent on\nsuch a goal, that is for children's books. This truly dangerous\nwizard shall perhaps be bent on some project of which he\nanticipates great renown, and the certain prospect of losing that\nrenown and living out his life in obscurity will seem to him more\nvivid than the unknown prospect of destroying his country. Or he\nshall have promised success to one he cannot bear to disappoint.\nPerhaps he has children in debt. There is much literary wisdom in\nthose stories. It is born of harsh experience and cities of ash.\nThe most likely prospect for disaster is a powerful wizard who, for\nwhatever reason, cannot bring himself to halt as warning signs\nappear. Though he may speak much and loudly of caution, he will not\nbe able to bring himself actually to halt. I wonder, Mr. Potter,\nhave you thought of trying anything which Hermione Granger herself\nwould have told you not to do?\"",
      "\"All right, point taken,\" said Harry. \"Professor, I am\nwell aware that if I save Hermione at the price of two other\npeople's lives, I've lost on total points from a utilitarian\nstandpoint. I am extremely aware that Hermione would not\nwant me to risk destroying a whole country just to save her. That's\njust common sense.\"",
      "\"Child who destroys Dementors,\" said that soft voice, \"if it\nwere only one country I feared you might ruin, I would be less\nconcerned. I did not at first credit that your knowledge of Muggle\nscience and Muggle practices would be a source of great power. I\nnow credit it more. I am, in complete sincerity, concerned for the\nsafety of that golden plaque.\"",
      "\"Well, if science fiction has taught me anything,\" said Harry,\n\"it's taught me that destroying the Solar System is not morally\nacceptable, especially if you do it before humanity has colonized\nany other star systems.\"",
      "\"Then will you give up this -\"",
      "\"No,\" Harry said without even thinking before he opened his\nmouth. After a moment, he added, \"But I do understand what you're\ntrying to tell me.\"",
      "Silence. The stars had not shifted, not even as they would have\nin an Earthly night sky, over time.",
      "A very slight rustle, as of someone shifting their body. Harry\nrealized that he had been standing for a while in the same\nposition, and dropped down to the almost unseeable circle of grass\nthat still stayed beneath him, careful not to touch the edges of\nthe spell.",
      "\"Tell me this,\" said the soft voice. \"Why does that girl matter\nto you so much?\"",
      "\"Because she is my friend.\"",
      "\"In the English language as it is customarily used, Mr. Potter,\nthe word 'friend' is not associated with a desperate effort to\nraise the dead. Are you under the impression that she is your true\nlove, or some such?\"",
      "\"Oh, not you too,\" Harry said wearily. \"Not you of all people,\nProfessor. Fine, we're best friends, but that's all, okay?\nThat's enough. Friends don't let friends stay dead.\"",
      "\"Ordinary folk do not do as much, for those they call friends.\"\nThe voice sounded more distant now, abstracted. \"Not even for those\nthey say they love. Their companions die, and they do not go in\nsearch of power to resurrect them.\"",
      "Harry couldn't help himself. He looked over again, despite\nknowing it would be futile, and saw only more stars. \"Let me guess,\nfrom this you deduce that... people don't actually care as much\nabout their friends as they pretend.\"",
      "A brief laugh. \"They would scarcely pretend to care\nless.\"",
      "\"They care, Professor, and not just for their true loves.\nSoldiers throw themselves on grenades to save their friends,\nmothers run into burning houses to save their children. But if\nyou're a Muggle you don't think there's any such thing as magic to\nbring someone back to life. And normal wizards don't... think\noutside the box like that. I mean, most wizards aren't\nsearching for power to make themselves immortal. Does that\nprove they don't care about their own lives?\"",
      "\"As you say, Mr. Potter. Certainly I myself would consider their\nlives pointless and without a shred of value. Perhaps, somewhere in\ntheir hidden hearts, they also believe that my opinion of them is\nthe correct one.\"",
      "Harry shook his head, and then, in annoyance, cast back the hood\nof his Cloak, and shook his head again. \"That seems like a rather\ncontrived view of the world, Professor,\" said the dim-lit\nhead of a boy, floating unsupported on a circle of dark grass amid\nstars. \"Trying to invent a resurrection spell just isn't something\nnormal people would think of, so you can't deduce anything from\ntheir not taking the option.\"",
      "A moment later, the dim-lit outline of a man sitting on the\ncircle of grass was visible as well.",
      "\"If they truly cared about their supposed loved ones,\"\nthe Defense Professor said softly, \"they would think of it, would\nthey not?\"",
      "\"Brains don't work that way. They don't suddenly supercharge\nwhen the stakes go up - or when they do, it's within hard limits. I\ncouldn't calculate the thousandth digit of pi if someone's life\ndepended on it.\"",
      "The dim-lit head inclined. \"But there is another possible\nexplanation, Mr. Potter. It is that people play the role\nof friendship. They do just as much as that role requires of them,\nand no more. The thought occurs to me that perhaps the difference\nbetween you and them is not that you care more than they do. Why\nwould you have been born with such unusually strong emotions of\nfriendship, that you alone among wizardkind are driven to resurrect\nHermione Granger after her death? No, the most likely difference is\nnot that you care more. It is that, being a more logical creature\nthan they, you alone have thought that playing the role of Friend\nwould require this of you.\"",
      "Harry stared out at the stars. He would have been lying if he'd\nclaimed not to be shaken. \"That... can't be true, Professor. I\ncould name a dozen examples in Muggle novels of people driven to\nresurrect their dead friends. The authors of those stories clearly\nunderstood exactly how I feel about Hermione. Though you wouldn't\nhave read them, I guess... maybe Orpheus and Eurydice? I didn't\nactually read that one but I know what's in it.\"",
      "\"Such tales are also told among wizardkind. There is the story\nof the Elric brothers. The tale of Dora Kent, who was protected by\nher son Saul. There is Ronald Mallett and his doomed challenge to\nTime. In Sicily before its fall, the drama of Precia Testarossa. In\nNippon they tell of Akemi Homura and her lost love. What these\nstories have in common, Mr. Potter, is that they are all\nfiction. Real-life wizards do not attempt the same, even\nthough the notion is clearly not beyond their\nimagination.\"",
      "\"Because they don't think they can!\u202f\" Harry's voice\nrose.",
      "\"Shall we go and tell the good Professor McGonagall about your\nintention to find a way to resurrect Miss Granger, and see what she\nthinks of it? Perhaps it has simply never occurred to her to\nconsider that option... Ah, but you hesitate. You already know her\nanswer, Mr. Potter. Do you know why you know it?\" You could hear\nthe cold smile in the voice. \"A lovely technique, that. Thank you\nfor teaching it to me.\"",
      "Harry was aware of the tension that had developed in his face,\nhis words came out as though bitten off. \"Professor McGonagall has\nnot grown up with the Muggle concept of the increasing power of\nscience, and nobody's ever told her that when a friend's life is at\nstake is a time when you need to think very rationally\n-\"",
      "The Defense Professor's voice was also rising. \"The\nTransfiguration Professor is reading from a script, Mr.\nPotter! That script calls for her to mourn and grieve, that all may\nknow how much she cared. Ordinary people react poorly if you\nsuggest that they go off-script. As you already knew!\"",
      "\"That's funny, I could have sworn I saw Professor McGonagall\ngoing off-script at dinner yesterday. If I saw her go off-script\nanother ten times I might actually try to talk to her about\nresurrecting Hermione, but right now she's new to that and needs\npractice. In the end, Professor, what you're trying to explain away\nby calling love and friendship and everything else a lie is just\nhuman beings not knowing any better.\"",
      "The Defense Professor's voice rose in pitch. \"If it were you who\nhad been killed by that troll, it would not even occur to\nHermione Granger to do as you are doing for her! It would not occur\nto Draco Malfoy, nor to Neville Longbottom, nor to McGonagall or\nany of your precious friends! There is not one person in this world\nwho would return to you the care that you are showing her! So\nwhy? Why do it, Mr. Potter?\" There was a strange, wild\ndesperation in that voice. \"Why be the only one in the world who\ngoes to such lengths to keep up the pretense, when none of them\nwill ever do the same for you?\"",
      "\"I believe you are factually mistaken, Professor,\" Harry\nreturned evenly. \"About a number of things, in fact. At the very\nleast, your model of my emotions is flawed. Because you don't\nunderstand me the tiniest bit, if you think that it would stop me\nif everything you said was true. Everything in the world\nhas to start somewhere, every event that happens has to happen for\na first time. Life on Earth had to start with some little\nself-replicating molecule in a pool of mud. And if I were the first\nperson in the world, no -\"",
      "Harry's hand swept out, to indicate the terribly distant points\nof light.",
      "\"- if I were the first person in the universe who ever\nreally cared about someone else, which I'm not by the way,\nthen I'd be honored to be that person, and I'd try to do it\njustice.\"",
      "There was a long silence.",
      "\"You truly do care about that girl,\" the man's dim outline said\nsoftly. \"You care about her in the way that none of them\nare capable of caring for their own lives, let alone each other.\"\nThe Defense Professor's voice had become strange, filled with some\nindecipherable emotion. \"I do not understand it, but I know the\nlengths you will go to because of it. You will challenge death\nitself, for her. Nothing will sway you from that.\"",
      "\"I care enough to make an actual effort,\" Harry said quietly.\n\"Yes, that is correct.\"",
      "The starlight slowly began to fracture, the world shining\nthrough the cracks; slashes through the night showing treetrunks\nand leaves glowing in the sunlight. Harry raised a hand, blinking\nhard, as the returning brightness smashed into his dark-adjusted\neyes; and his eyes automatically went to the Defense Professor,\njust in case an attack occurred while he was blinded.",
      "When all the stars had gone and only daylight remained,\nProfessor Quirrell was still sitting on the grass. \"Well, Mr.\nPotter,\" he said in his normal voice, \"if that is so, then I shall\ngive you what help I can, while I can.\"",
      "\"You'll what?\u202f\" Harry said involuntarily.",
      "\"My offer as I made it yesterday still stands. Ask and I will\nanswer. Show me the same science books you deemed suitable for Mr.\nMalfoy, and I shall look them over and tell you what comes to mind.\nDon't look so surprised, Mr. Potter, I would hardly leave you to\nyour own devices.\"",
      "Harry stared, tear ducts still watering from the sudden\nlight.",
      "Professor Quirrell looked back at him. Something strange glinted\nin the pale eyes. \"I have done what I can, and now I fear I must\ntake my leave of you. Good -\" and the Defense Professor hesitated.\n\"Good day, Mr. Potter.\"",
      "\"Good -\" Harry began.",
      "The man sitting on the grass fell over, his head impacting the\nground with a light thud. At the same time the sense of doom\ndiminished so sharply that Harry leapt to his feet, his heart\nsuddenly in his throat.",
      "But the figure on the ground slowly pushed back up to a crawling\nposition. Turned to look at Harry, eyes empty, mouth slack. Tried\nto stand, fell back to the ground.",
      "Harry took a step forward, sheer instinct telling him to offer a\nhand, although that was incorrect; the apprehension that rose up in\nhim, however faint, spoke of continued danger.",
      "But the fallen figure flinched away from Harry, and then slowly\nbegan crawl to away from him, in the general direction of the\ndistant castle.",
      "The boy standing amid the forest gazed after."

      "The fourth meeting:\n(4:38pm, April 17th, 1992)",
      "The man wearing the worn, warm coat, with three faint scars\netched forever into his cheek, observed Harry Potter as closely as\nhe could while the boy looked around politely at the rows of\ncottages. For someone whose best friend had died yesterday, Harry\nPotter seemed strangely composed, though not in any way reminiscent\nof unfeelingness, or normality. I don't wish to talk about\nthat, the boy had said, with you or anyone. Saying\n'wish' and not 'want', as though to emphasize that he was able to\nuse grownup words and make grownup decisions. There had been only\none thing Remus Lupin had thought of that might help, after he'd\nreceived the owls from Professor McGonagall and that strange man\nQuirinus Quirrell.",
      "\"There's a lot of empty houses,\" the boy said, glancing around\nagain.",
      "Godric's Hollow had changed, in the decade since Remus Lupin had\nbeen a frequent visitor. Many of the old, peaked cottages looked\ndeserted, with green leafy vines growing across their windows and\ntheir doors. Britain had contracted noticeably, in the aftermath of\nthe Wizarding War, having lost not only the dead but the fled.\nGodric's Hollow had been hard-hit. And afterward still more\nfamilies had moved elsewhere, to Hogsmeade or magical London, the\ndeserted houses too uncomfortable a reminder.",
      "Others had remained. Godric's Hollow was older than Hogwarts,\nolder than Godric Gryffindor whose name it had taken, and there\nwere families which would reside here until the end of the world\nand its magic.",
      "The Potters had been one such family, and would be again, if the\nlast Potter so chose.",
      "Remus Lupin tried to explain all that, simplifying it as best he\ncould for the young boy. The Ravenclaw nodded thoughtfully and said\nnothing, as though he had understood it all without need of\nquestions. Perhaps that was so; the child of James Potter and Lily\nEvans, the Head Boy and Head Girl of Hogwarts, would hardly be\nstupid. The child had certainly seemed highly intelligent, for the\nlittle time that they had spoken in January, though at that time\nRemus had done most of the talking.",
      "(There was also that business with the Wizengamot which Remus\nhad heard rumors about, but Remus didn't believe a single word of\nthat, any more than he'd believed it about James betrothing his son\nto Molly's youngest.)",
      "\"There's the monument,\" Remus said, pointing ahead of them.",
      "Harry walked beside Mr. Lupin toward the black marble obelisk,\nthinking silently. It seemed to Harry that this adventure was\nessentially misguided; he had no use for grief counseling, that was\nnot Harry's chosen path. So far as Harry was concerned, the five\nstages of grief were Rage, Remorse, Resolve, Research, and\nResurrection. (Not that the usual 'five stages of grief' had any\nexperimental evidence whatsoever that Harry had ever heard about.)\nBut Mr. Lupin had seemed too sincere to refuse; and visiting James\nand Lily's home was something Harry felt he ought not to turn down.\nSo Harry walked, feeling oddly detached; walking silently through a\nplay whose script he was not interested in reading.",
      "Harry had been told that he wasn't to wear the Cloak of\nInvisibility for this journey, so that Mr. Lupin could keep track\nof him.",
      "Harry was morally certain that Dumbledore, or both Dumbledore\nand Mad-Eye Moody, were following them invisibly to see if anyone\ntried for the bait. There was no way Harry would have been let out\nof Hogwarts with only Remus Lupin for a guard. Harry didn't expect\nanything to happen, though. He'd seen nothing to contradict the\nhypothesis that all the danger centered on Hogwarts and only\nHogwarts.",
      "As the two of them walked closer toward the center of town, the\nmarble obelisk transformed into -",
      "Harry drew in a breath. He'd been expecting a heroic pose of\nJames Potter with wand leveled against Lord Voldemort, and Lily\nPotter with arms outstretched in front of the crib.",
      "Instead there was a man with untidy hair and glasses, and a\nwoman with her hair let down and a baby in her arms, and that was\nall.",
      "\"It looks very... normal,\" Harry said, feeling an odd catch in\nhis throat.",
      "\"Madam Longbottom and Professor Dumbledore put their foot down\nhard,\" said Mr. Lupin, who was looking more at Harry than at the\nmonument. \"They said that the Potters should be remembered as they\nhad lived, not as they had died.\"",
      "Harry looked at the statue, thinking. Very strange, to see\nhimself as a baby of stone, with no scar upon his forehead. It was\na glimpse at an alternate universe, one where Harry James Potter\n(no Evans-Verres to his name) became an intelligent but ordinary\nwizarding scholar, maybe Sorted into Gryffindor like his parents. A\nHarry Potter who grew up a proper young wizard, knowing little of\nscience for all that his mother was Muggleborn. Ultimately\nchanging... not much. James and Lily wouldn't have raised their son\nwith what Professor Quirrell would have called ambition\nand what Professor Verres-Evans would have called the common\nendeavor. His birth parents would have loved him very much,\nand that would not have been much help to anyone in the world\nexcept Harry. If someone had undone their death -",
      "\"You were their friend,\" Harry said, turning to look at Lupin.\n\"For a long time, since you were children.\"",
      "Mr. Lupin nodded silently.",
      "Professor Quirrell's voice resounded in Harry's approximate\nmemory: The most likely difference is not that you care more.\nRather it is that, being a more logical creature than they, only\nyou are aware that the role of Friend ought to require this of\nyou...",
      "\"When Lily and James died,\" Harry said, \"did you think at all of\nwhether there might be some magical way to get them back? Like\nOrpheus and Eurydice? Or the, what was it, Elrin brothers?\"",
      "\"There is no magic which can undo death,\" Mr. Lupin said\nquietly. \"There are some mysteries which wizardry cannot\ntouch.\"",
      "\"Did you do a mental check of what you thought you knew, how you\nthought you knew it, and how high the probability was of that\nconclusion?\"",
      "\"What?\" said Mr. Lupin. \"Could you repeat that, Harry?\"",
      "\"I'm saying, did you think about it anyway?\"",
      "Mr. Lupin shook his head.",
      "\"Why not?\"",
      "\"Because it was already done, and over,\" Remus Lupin said\ngently. \"Because wherever James and Lily are now, they would wish\nme to act for the sake of the living, not the dead.\"",
      "Harry nodded silently. He'd been pretty sure of the answer to\nthat question before he'd asked. He'd already read that script. But\nhe'd asked anyway, just in case Mr. Lupin had spent a week\nobsessing about it, because Harry could have been wrong.",
      "The soft voice of the Defense Professor seemed to speak in\nHarry's mind. Surely, if Lupin truly cared, he would not need\nspecial instruction for something as simple as thinking for five\nminutes before giving up...",
      "Yes, he would, Harry answered the mental voice.\nHuman beings wouldn't suddenly obtain a skill like that just\nbecause they cared. I learned about it because I'd read library\nbooks, produced by a huge scientific edifice -",
      "And that other part of Harry said, in that soft voice, But\nthere is also another hypothesis, Mr. Potter, and it fits the data\nin a much less complicated way.",
      "No it doesn't! How would people even know what to pretend,\nif nobody had ever cared?",
      "They don't know. That is what you observe.",
      "The two of them walked onward toward a certain house, past a\nlong row of occupied wizard cottages and other cottages overgrown\nwith vines.",
      "Coming finally to the house with half its top blown off, and\ngreen leaves growing over into the inside; behind a shoulder-high\nwild-growing hedge lining the sidewalk, and a narrow metal gate\n(Mr. Hagrid had probably stepped right over it, being unable to fit\nthrough). The gap in the roof was like a giant mouth had taken a\ncircular bite from the house, leaving spines of wood, what had\nmaybe been support beams, sticking out. To the right side a single\nchimney still stood upright, uneaten by the giant bite, but leaning\ndangerously without its former support. Windows were shattered.\nWhere there should have been a front door were only splinters of\nwood.",
      "To this place Lord Voldemort had come, silently, making less\nnoise than the dead leaves slithering along the\npavement...",
      "Remus Lupin put a hand upon Harry's shoulder. \"Touch the gate,\"\nMr. Lupin urged.",

      "On this spot, on the night of 31\nOctober 1981,\nLily and James Potter lost their lives.",
      "They were survived by their son,\nHarry Potter,\nthe only wizard ever to withstand the Killing Curse,\nthe Boy-Who-Lived, who broke You-Know-Who's power.",
      "This house has been left in its\nruined state,\nas a monument to the Potters,\nas a reminder of their sacrifice.",
      "In a blank space below the golden letters were written other\nmessages, dozens of them, magical ink that rose to the surface and\ngleamed brightly enough to be read before fading and giving way to\nother messages.",
      "So my Gideon is avenged.",

      "\"I guess -\" Harry said. \"I guess that's what people do - instead\nof trying to make it better -\" Harry stopped. The thought seemed\nunworthy of this place. He looked up, and saw Remus Lupin gazing at\nhim with a look so gentle that Harry wrenched his eyes away to the\nblasted and broken roof.",
      "You were our miracle. Harry had always heard the word\n'miracle' in the context of how, in the natural universe, there was\nno such thing. And yet looking at the ruined house, he suddenly\nknew exactly what the word meant, the note of grace all\nunexplained, the blessing inexplicable. The Dark Lord had almost\nwon, and then in one night all the darkness and terror had ended,\nsalvation without justification, a sudden dawn from out of the\ndarkness and even now nobody knew why -",
      "If Lily Potter had lived beyond her confrontation with Lord\nVoldemort, she would have felt that way when she saw her baby\nalive, afterward.",
      "\"Let's go,\" whispered the baby boy, ten years later.",
      "They went.",
      "The graveyard's entrance was guarded by a lockless gate of the\nsort that kept out animals, with a place to stand while you moved\nthe door from one side of the standing-place to the other. Remus\ntook out his wand (Harry was already holding his) and there was a\nbrief blur as they stepped through.",
      "Some of the stones rising up from the ground looked as old as\nthe wall in Oxford that his father had said was around a thousand\nyears old.",
      "Hallie Fleming, said the first stone that Harry saw, in\na carving almost invisibly faded with the erosion of time.\nVienna Wood, said another.",
      "It had been a long time since Harry had visited a graveyard. His\nmind had still been childlike the last time he'd come to one, long\nbefore he'd seen within Death's shadow. Coming here now was...\nstrange, and sad, and puzzling, and this has been happening for\nso long, why haven't wizards tried to stop it, why aren't they\nputting all their strength into that like Muggles do with medical\nresearch, only more so, wizards have more reason to\nhope...",
      "\"The Dumbledores lived in Godric's Hollow too?\" Harry said, as\nthey walked past a pair of relatively new stones saying Kendra\nDumbledore and Ariana Dumbledore.",
      "\"For a long, long time,\" Mr. Lupin said.",

      "Then Mr. Lupin pointed at a linked double headstone, of marble\nstill white and unaged.",

      "\"That?\" Mr. Lupin said. \"That's the... motto, I suppose you\ncould call it, of the Potters. Though I don't think it was ever\nsomething as formal as that. Just a saying handed down from long,\nlong ago...\"",
      "\"This - that -\" Harry scrambled down to kneel beside the grave,\ntouched the inscription with a trembling hand. \"How?\nThings like that can't just be, be genetic -\"",
      "Then Harry saw what tears had blurred, the faint carving of a\nline, within a circle, within a triangle.",
      "The symbol of the Deathly Hallows.",
      "And Harry understood.",
      "\"They tried,\" Harry whispered.",
      "The three Peverell brothers.",
      "Had they lost someone precious to them, was that where it\nhad begun?",
      "\"With all their lives, they tried, and they made progress -\"",
      "The Cloak of Invisibility, that could defeat the Dementors'\nsight.",
      "\"- but their research wasn't finished -\"",
      "Hiding from Death's shadow is not defeating Death itself.\nThe Resurrection Stone couldn't really bring anyone back. The Elder\nWand couldn't protect you from old age.",
      "\"- so they passed on the mission to their children, and their\nchildren's children.\"",
      "Generation after generation.",
      "Until it came to me.",
      "Could Time echo like that, rhyming, between this far into the\nfuture, and that far in the past? It couldn't be\ncoincidence, could it? Not this message, not in this place.",
      "My family.",
      "You really were, my mother and my father.",
      "\"It doesn't mean resurrecting the dead, Harry,\" Mr. Lupin said.\n\"It means accepting death, and so being beyond death, mastering\nit.\"",
      "\"Did James tell you that?\" Harry said, his voice strange.",
      "\"No,\" said Mr. Lupin, \"but -\"",
      "\"Good.\"",
      "Harry rose up slowly from where he had been kneeling, feeling as\nthough he were pushing up a sun upon his shoulders, raising the\ndawn above the horizon.",
      "Of course other wizards have tried. I am not\nunique. I was never alone. These feelings in my heart, they're not\nso special, not in the wizard world or the Muggle one.",
      "\"Harry, your wand!\" There was a sudden excitement in Mr. Lupin's\nvoice, and when Harry raised his wand to look at it closely, he saw\nthat it was gleaming ever so faintly with a silver light, welling\nout of the wood.",
      "\"Cast the Patronus Charm!\" urged Mr. Lupin. \"Try casting it\nagain, Harry!\"",
      "Oh, right. So far as Mr. Lupin knows, I can't -",
      "Harry smiled, and even laughed a little. \"I'd better not,\" Harry\nsaid. \"If I tried to cast the spell in this state of mind, it'd\nprobably kill me.\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" said Mr. Lupin. \"The Patronus Charm doesn't do\nthat!\"",
      "Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres raised his left hand, still\nlaughing, and wiped away some more tears.",
      "\"You know, Mr. Lupin,\" Harry said, \"it really takes a\nbaroque interpretation to think that somebody would be\nwalking around, pondering how death is just something we all have\nto accept, and communicate their state of mind by saying, 'The last\nenemy that shall be destroyed is death.' Maybe someone else thought\nit sounded poetic and picked up the phrase and tried to interpret\nit differently, but whoever said it first didn't like death much.\"\nSometimes it puzzled Harry how most people didn't seem to even\nnotice when they were twisting something around to the\n180-degree opposite of its first obvious reading. It couldn't be a\nraw brainpower thing, people could see the obvious reading of most\nother English sentences. \"Also 'shall be destroyed' refers to a\nchange of future state, so it can't be about the way things are\nnow.\"",
      "Remus Lupin was staring at him with wide eyes. \"You certainly\nare James and Lily's child,\" the man said, sounding rather\nshocked.",
      "\"Yes, I am,\" Harry said. But that wasn't enough, he had to do\nsomething more, so Harry raised his wand in the air and said, his\nvoice as steady as he could make it, \"I am Harry James\nPotter-Evans-Verres, the son of Lily and James, of the house of\nPotter, and I accept my family's quest. Death is my enemy, and I\nwill defeat it.\"",
      "Thrayen beyn Peverlas soona ahnd thrih heera toal thissoom\nDath bey yewoonen.",
      "\"What?\" Harry said aloud. The words had popped up into his\nstream of consciousness as though from his own thoughts,\nunexplained.",
      "\"What was that?\" said Remus Lupin at the same time.",
      "Harry turned, scanning the graveyard, but he didn't see\nanything. Beside him, Mr. Lupin was doing the same.",
      "Neither of them noticed the tall stone worn as though from a\nthousand years of age, upon it a line within a circle within a\ntriangle glowing ever so faintly silver, like the light which had\nshone from Harry's wand, invisible at that distance beneath the\nstill-bright Sun.",
      "Some time later:",
      "\"Thank you again, Mr. Lupin,\" Harry said, the tall, faintly\nscarred man was about to depart once more. \"Though I really wish\nyou hadn't -\"",
      "\"Professor Dumbledore said that I was to portkey us back to\nHogwarts if anything unusual happened, whether or not it seemed\nlike an attack,\" Mr. Lupin said firmly. \"Which is eminently\nsensible.\"",
      "Harry nodded. And then, having carefully saved this question for\nlast, \"Do you have any idea of what the words meant?\"",
      "\"If I did, I wouldn't tell you,\" Mr. Lupin said, looking rather\nsevere. \"Certainly not without Professor Dumbledore's permission. I\ncan understand your eagerness, but you should not go trying to\nuncover any ancestral secrets of the Potters until you are an\nadult. That means after you've passed your NEWTs, Harry, or at\nleast your OWLs. And I still think you've picked up entirely the\nwrong idea of what your family motto is meant to say!\"",
      "Harry nodded, sighing internally, and bid Mr. Lupin\nfarewell.",
      "Harry went back through Hogwarts, to the Ravenclaw Tower,\nfeeling strange, and strengthened. He would not have expected any\nof that, but it had been all to the good.",
      "He was passing through the Ravenclaw common room, on the way to\nhis dorm.",
      "That was when the shining creature came to him, gleaming soft\nwhite beneath the candlefires of the Ravenclaw common room, as it\nslithered out from nowhere, the silver snake.",
      "\u00deregen b\u00e9on Pefearles suna and\n\u00ferie hira t\u00f3l \u00feissum D\u00e9a\u00f0 b\u00e9o gewunen.",
      "Three shall be Peverell's sons and\nthree their devices by which Death shall be defeated.",
      "- Spoken in the presence of the three\nPeverell brothers,\nin a small tavern on the outskirts of what would later be called\nGodric's Hollow."

      "For the second time that day, Harry's eyes filled with tears.\nHeedless of the puzzled eyes of the Ravenclaws in the common room,\nhe reached out to the silver creature which Draco Malfoy had sent,\ncradling it in his arms like a live thing; and stumbled off in the\ndirection of his dorm room, heading half-blindly for the bottom of\nhis trunk, as the silver snake waited silently in his arms.",
      "The fifth meeting: 10:12am, Sunday, April 19th.",
      "The debtor's meeting which Lord Malfoy had demanded from Harry\nPotter, who owed Lucius Malfoy a debt of some 58,203 Galleons, was\nheld within the Gringotts Central Bank, in accordance with the laws\nof Britain.",
      "There had been some pushback from Chief Warlock Dumbledore,\ntrying to prevent Harry Potter from leaving the security of\nHogwarts (a phrase that caused Harry Potter to raise his fingers\nand silently make quote marks in the air). For his own part, the\nBoy-Who-Lived had seemingly pondered quietly, and then assented to\nthe meeting, strangely compliant in the face of his enemy's\ndemand.",
      "The Headmaster of Hogwarts, who acted as Harry Potter's legal\nguardian in the eyes of magical Britain, had overruled his ward's\nassent.",
      "The Debts Committee of the Wizengamot had overruled the\nHeadmaster of Hogwarts.",
      "The Chief Warlock had overruled the Debts Committee.",
      "The Wizengamot had overruled the Chief Warlock.",
      "And so the Boy-Who-Lived had departed under the heavy guard of\nMad-Eye Moody and an Auror trio for the Gringotts Central Bank;\nwith Moody's bright-blue eye rotating wildly in every direction, as\nthough to signal to any possible attacker that he was On Guard and\nConstantly Vigilant and would cheerfully incinerate the kidneys of\nanyone who sneezed in the general direction of the\nBoy-Who-Lived.",
      "Harry Potter watched more keenly than before, as they marched\nthrough the wide-open front doors of Gringotts, beneath the motto\nFortius Quo Fidelius. On Harry's last three visits to\nGringotts he had merely admired the marble pillars, the\ngold-burning torchlights, the architecture not quite like the human\nparts of magical Britain. Since then had come the Incident at\nAzkaban and other things; and now, on his fourth visit, Harry was\nthinking about the Goblin Rebellions and goblins' ongoing\nresentment at not being allowed to own wands and certain facts\nwhich hadn't been in the first-year History textbook, which Harry\nhad guessed at by pattern-matching and which Professor Flitwick had\nconfirmed in a very quiet voice. Lord Voldemort had killed goblins\nas well as wizards - an incredibly stupid move on Lord Voldemort's\npart, unless Harry was really missing something - but what goblins\nthought of the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry had no idea. Goblins had a\nreputation for paying what they owed and taking what they thought\nowed them, along with a reputation for interpreting those accounts\nin a somewhat prejudiced fashion.",
      "Today, the guards standing upright in armor at regular intervals\naround the bank were staring at the Boy-Who-Lived with blank faces,\nand glaring at Moody and the Aurors with flashes of bitter\ncontempt. At the stands and counters of the bank's foyer, goblin\ntellers stared with equal contempt at the wizards whose hands they\nwere filling with Galleons; one teller smiled a sharp-toothed grin\nat a witch who was looking angry and desperate.",
      "If I understand human nature correctly - and if I'm right\nthat all the humanoid magical species are genetically human plus a\nheritable magical effect - then you're not likely to become friends\nwith a wizard just because I'm polite to you, or say that I'm\nsympathetic. But I wonder if you would back the\nBoy-Who-Lived in a bid to overthrow the Ministry, if I promised to\nrevoke the Wand Law afterward... or if I quietly gave you wands,\nand spellbooks, in exchange for your support... is that why the\nsecret of wand-making is restricted to people like Ollivander?\nThough if you really are human, just plain human, then the goblin\nnation probably has its own internal horrors, its own Azkabans, for\nthat is also human nature; in which case sooner or later I must\noverthrow or reform your own government as well. Hm.",
      "An aged goblin appeared before them, and Harry inclined his head\nwith careful courtesy, a gesture that the aged goblin returned with\nan abrupt half-nod. There was no wild train ride; instead the aged\ngoblin ushered them into a short hallway that terminated in a small\nwaiting room, with three goblin-sized benches and one wizard-sized\nchair, within which nobody sat.",
      "\"Do not sign anything that Lucius Malfoy gives you,\" Mad-Eye\nMoody said. \"Nothing, do you understand me, lad? If Malfoy\nhands you a copy of The Wonderful Adventures of the\nBoy-Who-Lived and asks you for an autograph, tell him that\nyou've sprained a finger. Don't pick up a quill for a single second\nwhile you're in Gringotts. If someone hands you a quill, break the\nquill and then break your own fingers. Do I need to explain\nfurther, son?\"",
      "\"Not particularly,\" Harry said. \"We also have lawyers in Muggle\nBritain, and they'd think your lawyers are cute.\"",
      "A short time later Harry Potter handed his wand over to an\narmored goblin guard who frisked him with all manner of\ninteresting-looking probes, and gave his pouch to Moody to\nkeep.",
      "And then Harry stepped through another door, and a brief\nwaterfall of Thief's Downfall, which evaporated from his skin as\nsoon as he stepped out.",
      "On the other side of the door was a larger room, richly paneled\nand appointed, with a great golden table stretching across it; two\nhuge leather chairs on one side of the table, and a small wooden\nstool on the other, the debtor's perch. Two goblins in full armor,\nwearing ornate earpieces and glasses, stood watch around the room.\nNeither side would have wands or any other device of magic, and the\ngoblin guards would attack immediately if anyone dared to use\nwandless magic within this peaceable meeting supervised by\nGringotts Bank. The ornate earpieces would prevent the goblin\nguards from hearing the conversation unless directly addressed, the\neyepieces would leave the wizards' faces as blurs. It was, in\nshort, something along the lines of actual security, at\nleast if you were an Occlumens.",
      "Harry climbed up onto his uncomfortable wooden stool, thinking\nSubtle in a tone of some mental sarcasm, and awaited his\ncreditors.",
      "It was only a brief interval later, much shorter than the time a\ndebtor could legally be made to wait, when Lucius Malfoy entered\ninto the room, taking up his leather chair with motions worn smooth\nby practice. His snake-headed cane was missing from his hands, his\nlong white mane drifted behind him the same as ever, his face could\nnot be read.",
      "Quietly following behind him was a young boy with white-blonde\nhair, now wearing black robes far finer than any Hogwarts uniform,\nwho followed in his father's footsteps with a controlled face. A\nboy who was also Harry's creditor to the tune of forty Galleons,\nand also of House Malfoy, and therefore, technically, covered by\nthe Wizengamot resolution enabling this meeting.",
      "Draco. Harry didn't say it aloud, didn't let his own\nexpression change. He could not think of what to say. Not even\nI'm sorry seemed appropriate. Harry hadn't dared say any\nof that to Draco's Patronus either, when they had set up this\nmeeting in a few brief exchanges; and not only because Lucius might\nbe listening. It had been enough to know that Draco's happy thought\nwas still happy, and that he had still been able to want Harry to\nknow it.",
      "Lucius Malfoy spoke first, his voice level, his face set. \"I do\nnot understand what is happening at Hogwarts, Harry Potter. Would\nyou care to explain it to me?\"",
      "\"I don't know,\" Harry said. \"If I understood these events I\nwould not have let them happen, Lord Malfoy.\"",
      "\"Then answer me this question. Who are you?\"",
      "Harry gazed evenly at the face of his creditor. \"I'm not\nYou-Know-Who, like you thought I was,\" Harry said. Not being a\ncomplete idiot, he'd eventually worked out who Lucius\nMalfoy had thought he was talking to in front of the Wizengamot.\n\"Obviously I'm not a normal boy. Equally obviously, that probably\nhas something to do with the Boy-Who-Lived business. But I\ndon't know what, or why, any more than you do. I asked the Sorting\nHat and it didn't know either.\"",
      "Lucius Malfoy nodded distantly. \"I could not think of any reason\nwhy you would pay a hundred thousand Galleons to save a mudblood's\nlife. No reason save one, which would account for her power and\nbloodthirst alike; but then she died at the hands of a troll, and\nyet you lived. And also my son has told me much\nof you, Harry Potter, which did not make the tiniest bit of\nsense, I have heard the ravings of the mad in St. Mungo's and\nthey were more sensible by far than the events which my\nson told me under Veritaserum that you enacted,\nand that portion of this raving lunacy, which you\npersonally carried out, I would have you explain to me,\nand now.\"",
      "Harry turned to look at Draco, who looked back at him with a\nface that was screwing up, being controlled, and then tensing up\nagain.",
      "\"I'd also,\" Draco Malfoy said in a high and wavering voice,\n\"like, to know, why, Potter.\"",
      "Harry closed his eyes, and spoke without looking. \"A boy raised\nby Muggles who thought he was clever. You saw me, Draco, and you\nthought of how very useful it would be if the Boy-Who-Lived, out of\nall the other children in your year, could be shown the truth of\nthings, if we could be friends. And I thought the same thing about\nyou. Only, you and I believed different things were true. Not that\nI'm saying that there are different truths, I mean, there's\ndifferent beliefs but there's only one reality, only one universe\nthat can make those beliefs true or false -\"",
      "\"You lied to me.\"",
      "Harry opened his eyes and looked at Draco. \"I would prefer to\nsay,\" Harry said, not quite with a steady voice, \"that the things I\ntold you were true from a certain point of view.\"",
      "\"A certain point of view?\" Draco Malfoy looked every\nbit as angry as Luke Skywalker'd had the right to be, and not in a\nmood to accept Kenobi's excuses, either. \"There's a word for things\nthat are true from a certain point of view. They're called\nlies!\u202f\"",
      "\"Or tricks,\" Harry said evenly. \"Statements which are\ntechnically true but which deceive the listener into forming\nfurther beliefs which are false. I think it's worth making that\ndistinction. What I told you was a self-fulfilling prophecy; you\nbelieved that you couldn't deceive yourself, so you didn't try. The\nskills you've learned are real, and it would have been very bad for\nyou to start fighting against them internally. People can't make\nthemselves believe that blue is green by an act of will, but they\nthink they can, and that can be almost as bad.\"",
      "\"You used me,\" said Draco Malfoy.",
      "\"I only used you in ways that made you stronger. That's what it\nmeans to be used by a friend.\"",
      "\"Even I know that's not what friendship is!\"",
      "Now Lucius Malfoy spoke again. \"For what purpose? To what end?\"\nEven the elder Malfoy's voice was not quite steady.\n\"Why?\"",
      "Harry regarded him for a moment, and then turned to Draco. \"Your\nfather's probably not going to believe this,\" Harry said. \"But you,\nDraco, should be able to see that everything which has happened is\ncompatible with this hypothesis. And that any more cynical\nhypothesis wouldn't explain why I didn't press you harder when you\nthought I had leverage, or why I taught you so much. I thought that\nthe heir of House Malfoy, who'd been publicly seen to grab a\nMuggleborn girl to stop her falling off the roof of Hogwarts, would\nbe a good compromise candidate to lead magical Britain after the\nreformation.\"",
      "\"So you would have me believe,\" Lucius Malfoy said in a thin\nvoice, \"that you are claiming to be mad. Well, let us leave all\nthat aside. Tell me who set that troll on Hogwarts.\"",
      "\"I don't know,\" Harry said.",
      "\"Tell me who you suspect, Harry Potter.\"",
      "\"I have four suspects. One of them is Professor Snape -\"",
      "\"Snape?\u202f\" Draco burst out.",
      "\"The second, of course, is the Defense Professor of Hogwarts,\njust because he's the Defense Professor.\" Harry would have left him\nout, not wanting to bring Professor Quirrell to the Malfoys'\nattention if he was innocent, but Draco might have called him on\nthat. \"The third, you wouldn't believe me about. The fourth is a\ncatchall category called Everything Else.\" And the fifth, Lord\nVoldemort, I do not think I should name to you.",
      "Lucius Malfoy's face contorted in a snarl. \"Do you think I\ncannot recognize bait upon your hook? Tell me about this third\npossibility, Potter, the one you wish me to believe is the\ntrue answer, and leave aside games.\"",
      "Harry regarded Lord Malfoy steadily. \"I once read a book I\nwasn't supposed to read, and it told me this: Communication is an\nevent that takes place between equals. Employees lie to their\nbosses, who, in turn, expect to be lied to. I'm not playing coy,\nI'm observing that it's simply not possible, in our present\nsituation, for me to tell you about the third suspect, and have you\nbelieve that my story was anything but a lure.\"",
      "Draco spoke then. \"It's Father, isn't it?\"",
      "Harry gave Draco a startled look.",
      "Draco spoke evenly. \"You suspect that Father sent the troll into\nHogwarts to get at Granger, don't you? That's what you're thinking,\nisn't it!\"",
      "Harry opened his mouth to say, Actually, no, and then\nmanaged to think ahead and stop himself for once in his life.",
      "\"I see...\" Harry said slowly. \"That's what this is\nabout. Lucius Malfoy publicly says that Hermione won't get away\nwith what she's done, and lo and behold, a troll kills her.\" Harry\nsmiled then, in a way that bared his teeth. \"And if I deny that\nhere, then Draco, who isn't an Occlumens, can then testify under\nVeritaserum that the Boy-Who-Lived does not suspect Lucius\nMalfoy of having sent a troll into Hogwarts to kill Hermione\nGranger, sworn to the Noble House of Potter, whose blood debt was\nrecently purchased for a hundred thousand Galleons et cetera.\"\nHarry leaned back slightly, though his wooden stool had no back\nwith which to do it properly. \"But now that it's been pointed out,\nI see that it's very reasonable. Obviously you killed\nHermione Granger, just like you threatened to do in front of the\nwhole Wizengamot.\"",
      "\"I did not,\" Lucius Malfoy said, expressionless once more.",
      "Harry bared his teeth again in that non-smile. \"Well then, in\nthat case, there must be someone else out there\nwho killed Hermione and messed with the Hogwarts wards, the same\nperson who earlier tried to frame Hermione for Draco\nMalfoy's murder. Either you killed Hermione Granger after\nbeing paid for her life, or you blamed your son's attempted murder\non an innocent girl and took all my family's money under false\npretenses, one of those two things must be true.\"",
      "\"Perhaps you killed her in hopes of your money being\nreturned.\" Lucius Malfoy had leaned forward, and was staring hard\nat Harry.",
      "\"Then I would not have given away my money for her in\nthe first place. As you already know. Don't insult my intelligence,\nLord Malfoy - no, wait, sorry, you just had to say that in\ncase Draco had to testify to it, never mind.\"",
      "Lucius Malfoy sat back in his chair and stared.",
      "\"I tried to tell you, Father,\" Draco said under his breath, \"but\nnobody can imagine Harry Potter until they've actually met\nhim...\"",
      "Harry tapped a finger on his cheek. \"So people are starting to\nfigure out the blatantly obvious? I'm surprised, actually. I\nwouldn't have predicted that would happen.\" Harry had by now caught\nthe general rhythm of Professor Quirrell's cynicism and was able to\ngenerate it independently. \"I wouldn't think a newspaper would be\nable to report on a concept like 'Either X or Y must be true, but\nwe don't know which.' I would only expect journalists to report\nstories consisting of series of atomic propositions, like 'X is\ntrue', 'Y is false', or 'X is true and Y is false'. Not more\ncomplex logical connectors like 'If X is true then Y is true, but\nwe don't know whether X is true'. And all your supporters ought to\nbe rapidly switching between 'You can't prove that Lord Malfoy\nkilled Granger, it could've been someone else' and 'You can't prove\nthere was someone else to frame Granger', so long as it's uncertain\nthey should be trying to have it both ways at once... wait, don't\nyou own the Daily Prophet?\"",
      "\"The Daily Prophet,\" Lucius Malfoy said thinly, \"which I\ncertainly do not own, is far too respectable to publish any such\nscurrilous nonsense. Unfortunately, not all wizards of influence\nare so reasonable.\"",
      "\"Ah. Got it.\" Harry nodded.",
      "Lucius glanced at Draco. \"The rest of what he said - was any of\nit important?\"",
      "\"No, Father, it was not.\"",
      "\"Thank you, son.\" Lucius returned his gaze to Harry. His voice,\nwhen he spoke, was something closer to his usual drawl, cool and\nconfident. \"It is possible that I could be persuaded to show you\nsome favor, if you admitted before the Wizengamot what you clearly\nknow, that I was not responsible for this deed. I would be willing\nto reduce your remaining debt to House Malfoy quite significantly,\nor even adjust the terms to allow later repayment.\"",
      "Harry regarded Lucius Malfoy steadily. \"Lucius Malfoy. You are\nnow perfectly aware that Hermione Granger was, in fact, framed\nusing your son as bait, that she was False-Memory-Charmed or worse,\nand that House Potter held nothing against you before that. My\ncounterproposal is that you return my family's money, I announce\nbefore the Wizengamot that House Potter holds House Malfoy no\nanimus, and we present a united front against whoever's doing this.\nWe decide to screw the roles we're supposed to play, and ally with\neach other instead of fighting. It could be the one thing the enemy\ndoesn't expect us to do.\"",
      "There was a brief silence in the room, except for the two goblin\nguards who went on breathing regardless.",
      "\"You are mad,\" Lucius Malfoy said coldly.",
      "\"It's called justice, Lord Malfoy. You cannot possibly expect me\nto cooperate with you while you are holding the wealth of House\nPotter under what you now know to be false pretenses. I understand\nhow it looked to you at the time, but you know better now.\"",
      "\"You have nothing to offer me worth a hundred thousand\nGalleons.\"",
      "\"Don't I?\" Harry said distantly. \"I wonder. I think it quite\nprobable that you care more about the long-term welfare of House\nMalfoy than about whichever political issue the last generation's\nfailed Dark Lord made his personal hobbyhorse.\" Harry glanced\nsignificantly at Draco. \"The next generation is drawing its own\nbattle lines and forming new alliances. Your son can be frozen out\nof that, or he can go straight to the top. Is that worth more to\nyou than forty thousand Galleons you weren't particularly expecting\nand don't particularly need?\" Harry smiled thinly. \"Forty thousand\nGalleons. Two million Muggle pounds sterling. Your son knows some\nthings about the size of the Muggle economy that might surprise\nyou. They'd find it amusing, that the fate of a country was\nrevolving around two million pounds sterling. They'd think it was\ncute. And I think much the same, Lord Malfoy. This isn't about me\nbeing desperate. This is about you getting a fair chance to be\nfair.\"",
      "\"Oh?\" said Lord Malfoy. \"And if I refuse your fair chance, what\nthen?\"",
      "Harry shrugged. \"Depends what sort of coalition government gets\nput together without the Malfoys. If the government can be reformed\npeacefully and it would disturb the peace to do otherwise, I'll pay\nyou the money out of petty cash. Or maybe the Death Eaters will be\nretried for past crimes and executed as a matter of justice, as a\nresult of due legal process, of course.\"",
      "\"You truly are mad,\" Lucius Malfoy said quietly. \"You have no\npower, no wealth, and yet you say such things to me.\"",
      "\"Yes, it's silly to think I could scare you. After all, you're\nnot a Dementor.\"",
      "And Harry went on smiling. He'd looked it up, and apparently a\nbezoar would heal almost any poison if you shoved it into\nsomeone's mouth fast enough. Maybe that wouldn't repair radiation\ndamage from Transfigured polonium, but then again, maybe it would.\nSo Harry had looked up the freezing points of various acids, and it\nturned out that sulfuric acid would freeze at just ten degrees\nCelsius, which meant Harry could buy a liter of acid on the Muggle\nmarket, freeze it solid, and Transfigure it down to a tiny little\nunnoticable water-ice chip to be flipped into someone's mouth and\ningested. No bezoar would compensate for that, once the\nTransfiguration wore off. Harry had no intention of saying it out\nloud, of course, but now that he'd failed decisively to prevent any\ndeaths during his quest, he had no further intention of being\nrestrained by the law or even the code of Batman.",
      "Last chance to live, Lucius. Ethically speaking, your life\nwas bought and paid for the day you committed your first atrocity\nfor the Death Eaters. You're still human and your life still has\nintrinsic value, but you no longer have the deontological\nprotection of an innocent. Any good person is licensed to kill you\nnow, if they think it'll save net lives in the long run; and I will\nconclude as much of you, if you begin to get in my way. Whoever\nsent the troll after Granger must have targeted you too and hit you\nwith some curse that makes former Death Eaters melt into a pile of\ngoo. Very sad.",
      "\"Father,\" Draco said in a small voice. \"I think you should\nconsider it, father.\"",
      "Lucius Malfoy looked at his son. \"You jest.\"",
      "\"It's true. I don't think Potter just made up his books, nobody\ncould have written all that and there were things in them that I\ncould check for myself. And if even half of all that is true, he's\nright, a hundred thousand Galleons won't mean much. If we give it\nto him he really will be friends with House Malfoy again - the way\nhe thinks of being friends, anyway. And if we don't, he'll\nbe your enemy, whether it's in his own interests or not, he'll just\ngo after you. Harry Potter really does think like that. It's not\nabout money to him, it's about what he thinks is honor.\"",
      "Harry Potter inclined his head, still smiling.",
      "\"But let's get one part of it straight,\" Draco said, now staring\ndirectly at him. There was a fierce light in his eyes. \"You\nwronged me. And you owe me.\"",
      "\"Acknowledged,\" Harry said quietly. \"Conditional on the rest of\nit, of course.\"",
      "Lucius Malfoy opened his mouth to say who-knew-what and then\nclosed it again. \"Mad,\" he said again.",
      "There was a long father-and-son argument during which Harry\nmanaged to keep his mouth shut.",
      "When it seemed that even Draco wouldn't be able to persuade his\nfather, Harry spoke up again, and proposed his intended next steps,\nif the Houses of Potter and Malfoy could cooperate.",
      "Then came more argument between Lucius and Draco, during which\nHarry again stayed silent.",
      "Finally Lucius Malfoy's eyes turned to gaze at Harry. \"And you\nbelieve,\" Lucius Malfoy said, \"that you can persuade Longbottom and\nBones to go along with this notion, even if Dumbledore opposes\nit.\"",
      "Harry nodded. \"They'll be suspicious of your involvement, of\ncourse. But I'll tell them that it was my plan to start with, and\nthat should help.\"",
      "\"I suppose,\" Lucius Malfoy said after a pause, \"that I could\nhave a contract drawn up, absolving you of almost all the\nremaining debt, if by some chance I do go along with this mad idea.\nIt shall need more guarantees, of course -\"",
      "Harry promptly reached into his robes and drew out a parchment,\nunfolding it and spreading it across the golden table. \"I've taken\nthe liberty myself, actually,\" Harry said. He'd spent some careful\nhours in the Hogwarts library with the law books available.\nThankfully, so far as Harry could tell, the laws of magical Britain\nwere charmingly simple by Muggle standards. Writing that the\noriginal blood debt and payment was cancelled, the Potters' wealth\nand all other vault items would be returned, and the remaining debt\nannulled, all with no fault to the Malfoys, was only a few more\nlines than it took to say out loud. \"I had to promise my keepers\nnot to sign anything you gave me. So I made sure to compose this\nmyself, and sign it before I left.\"",
      "Draco emitted a choked laugh.",
      "Lucius read through the contract, smiling humorlessly. \"How\ncharmingly straightforward.\"",
      "\"I also promised not to touch a quill while I was in Gringotts,\"\nHarry said. He reached into his robes again and drew out a Muggle\npen, along with a sheet of normal paper. \"Will this wording be all\nright?\" Harry rapidly scribbled down a legal-sounding statement to\nthe effect that House Potter didn't hold House Malfoy responsible\nin any way for Hermione Granger's murder and didn't believe they\nhad anything to do with it, then held up the paper in the air for\nLord Malfoy's inspection.",
      "Lord Malfoy looked at the paper, rolled his eyes slightly, and\nsaid, \"Good enough, I suppose. Though to have the proper meaning,\nyou should use the legal term indemnify rather than\nexonerate -\"",
      "\"Nice try, but no. I know exactly what that word means, Lord\nMalfoy.\" Harry took his parchment and began copying down his\noriginal wording more carefully.",
      "When Harry was done, Lord Malfoy reached across the golden table\nand took the pen, looking at it thoughtfully. \"One of your Muggle\nartefacts, I suppose? What does this do, son?\"",
      "\"It writes without needing an inkwell,\" Draco answered.",
      "\"I can see that. I suppose some might find it an amusing\ntrinket.\" Lucius smoothed the parchment contract over the table,\nthen set his hand by the line for signatures, tapping the pen\nthoughtfully on the starting spot.",
      "Harry wrenched his eyes away, up to Lucius Malfoy's face,\nforcing himself to breathe regularly, not quite able to stop his\nmuscles from tensing.",
      "\"Our good friend, Severus Snape,\" said Lucius Malfoy, still\ntapping the pen on the line awaiting his signature. \"The Defense\nProfessor, calling himself Quirrell. Now I ask again, who is your\nthird suspect, Harry Potter?\"",
      "\"I would strongly advise that you sign first, Lord Malfoy, if\nyou're going to do so anyway. You will benefit from this\ninformation more if you do not think I am trying to persuade you of\nsomething.\"",
      "Another humorless smile. \"I shall take my chances. Speak, if you\nwish this to continue.\"",
      "Harry hesitated, then said evenly, \"My third suspect is Albus\nDumbledore.\"",
      "The tapping pen stilled on the parchment. \"A strange\nallegation,\" Lucius drawled. \"Dumbledore lost much face when a\nHogwarts student died within his tenure. Do you suppose that I will\nbelieve anything of him, only because he is my enemy?\"",
      "\"He is one suspect among several, Lord Malfoy, and not\nnecessarily the most plausible. But the reason I was able to kill a\nfull-grown mountain troll was that I had a weapon which Dumbledore\ngave to me, at the start of the school year. It's not strong\nevidence, but it's suspicious. And if you're thinking that\nmurdering one of his students is not Dumbledore's style, well, the\nsame thought had occurred to me.\"",
      "\"It's not his style?\" Draco Malfoy said.",
      "Lucius Malfoy shook his head in a measured, careful movement.\n\"Not quite, my son. Dumbledore is particular in his evils.\" Lord\nMalfoy leaned back into his chair, and then sat quite still. \"Tell\nme of this weapon.\"",
      "\"I am not yet certain I should go into details about that in\nyour presence, Lord Malfoy.\" Harry took a breath. \"Let me\nbe clear on this. I am not trying to sell you on the idea that\nDumbledore is behind this, just raising the possibility -\"",
      "Then Draco Malfoy spoke. \"The device Dumbledore gave you - was\nit something to kill trolls? I mean, just trolls? Can you\ntell us that?\"",
      "Lucius turned his head to look at his son with some\nsurprise.",
      "\"No...\" Harry said slowly. \"It wasn't specifically a sword of\nanti-troll slaying, or anything like that.\"",
      "Draco's eyes were intent. \"Would the device have worked against\nan assassin?\"",
      "Not if they had shields raised. \"No.\"",
      "\"A fight in school?\"",
      "An expanding rock in the throat is inherently lethal.\n\"No. I don't think it was meant for use against humans.\"",
      "Draco nodded. \"So just magical creatures. Would it have been a\ngood weapon against an angry Hippogriff, or something like\nthat?\"",
      "\"Does the Stunning Hex work on Hippogriffs?\" Harry said\nslowly.",
      "\"I don't know,\" said Draco.",
      "\"Yes,\" said Lucius Malfoy.",
      "Compared to trying to target a Wingardium Leviosa and Finite\nIncantatem - \"Then a Stunning Hex would be a better way of\ndealing with a Hippogriff.\" Put that way, it did seem increasingly\nlike a Transfigured rock was an optimal weapon only\nagainst a flesh-and-blood magical creature with spell-resistant\nskin. \"But... I mean, it might not have been intended as a\nweapon at all, I used it in a strange way, it could have just been\na crazy whim -\"",
      "\"No,\" Lucius Malfoy said lowly. \"Not a whim. Not\ncoincidence. Not Dumbledore.\"",
      "\"Then it's him,\" Draco said. Slowly Draco's eyes narrowed, and\nhe gave a vicious nod. \"It's been him since the beginning.\nThe court Legilimens said that someone had used\nLegilimency on Granger. Dumbledore admitted that it was\nhim. And I bet the wards did go off when Granger cursed me\nand Dumbledore just ignored them.\"",
      "\"But -\" Harry said. He looked at Lucius, wondering if it was\nreally to his advantage to question this idea. \"What would be his\nmotive? Are we going to say he's evil and leave it at\nthat?\"",
      "Draco Malfoy jumped out of his chair and began pacing around the\nroom, black robes swishing behind the young boy, the goblin guards\nstaring at him in some surprise through their enchanted goggles.\n\"To figure out a strange plot, look at what happens, then ask who\nbenefits. Except that Dumbledore didn't plan on you trying to save\nGranger at her trial, he tried to stop you from doing that. What\nwould've happened if Granger had gone to Azkaban? House\nMalfoy and House Potter would've hated each other forever. Of all\nthe suspects, the only one who wants that is Dumbledore.\nSo it fits. It all fits. The one who really committed the\nmurder is - Albus Dumbledore!\"",
      "\"Um,\" Harry said. \"But why give me an anti-troll\nweapon? I said it was suspicious, I didn't say that it made any\nsense.\"",
      "Draco nodded thoughtfully. \"Maybe Dumbledore thought you'd stop\nthe troll before it got Granger and then he could blame Father for\nsending it. A lot of people would be very angry if they thought\nFather had even tried to do something like that, in\nHogwarts. Like Father said, Dumbledore must've lost face when\npeople found out that a student had actually died in Hogwarts,\nbeing safe is what Hogwarts is famous for. So that part probably\nwasn't supposed to happen.\"",
      "Harry's mind involuntarily flashed back to the horror in\nDumbledore's eyes when he'd seen Hermione Granger's body.",
      "Would I have gotten there in time, if the Weasley twins\nhadn't had their magic map stolen? Could that have been the plan?\nAnd then, though Dumbledore didn't know it, somebody stole their\nmap, and I was too late... but no, that doesn't make much sense, I\nfound out too late, how could Dumbledore have guessed that I'd use\na broomstick... well, he did know I had one...",
      "There was no way a plan like that could work.",
      "And it hadn't.",
      "But someone going a little bit senile might expect it\nto work, and a phoenix might not know the difference.",
      "\"Or,\" Draco Malfoy continued, still pacing energetically, \"maybe\nDumbledore had an enchanted troll around, and he expected you to\ndefeat it some other time, for some other plot, and then he used\nthe troll on Granger instead. I can't imagine Dumbledore had this\nall planned since the first week of lessons -\"",
      "\"I can imagine,\" Lucius Malfoy said in low tones. \"I have seen\nsuch, from Dumbledore.\"",
      "Draco nodded decisively. \"Then I was never supposed to\ndie in the first plot. Dumbledore knew Professor Quirrell was\nchecking on me, or Dumbledore planned to have someone else find me\nin time - I couldn't have testified against Granger if I was dead,\nand he'd have lost face if I'd died. But my leaving Hogwarts and\nnot being around to lead Slytherin would be just right for him. And\nthen the next time Harry was supposed to stop the troll before it\ngot Granger and everyone was supposed to blame you, Father, only\nthat time it didn't go the way Dumbledore planned.\"",
      "Lucius Malfoy lifted his grey eyes, from where he'd been gazing\nwith open surprise at his son. \"If this is true - but I wonder if\nHarry Potter is only playing at being reluctant to believe it.\"",
      "\"Maybe,\" Draco said. \"But I'm pretty sure he isn't.\"",
      "\"Then, if it is true...\" Lucius Malfoy's voice trailed off. A\nslow fury was lighting in his eyes.",
      "\"What would we do, exactly?\" Harry said.",
      "\"That, too, is clear to me,\" Draco said. He whirled on them and\nraised a finger high in the air. \"We shall find the proof to\nconvict Dumbledore of this crime, and bring him to justice!\"",
      "Harry Potter and Lucius Malfoy looked at each other.",
      "Neither of them quite knew what to say.",
      "\"My son,\" Lucius Malfoy said after a time, \"truly, you have done\nvery well this day.\"",
      "\"Thank you, Father!\"",
      "\"However, this is not a play, we are not Aurors, and we do not\nput our trust in trials.\"",
      "Some of the light went out of Draco's eyes. \"Oh.\"",
      "\"I, ah, do have a sentimental fondness for trials,\" Harry\ninterjected. I cannot believe I am having this\nconversation. He needed to go home and take a sheet of paper\nand a pencil and try to figure out whether Draco's reasoning\nactually made sense. \"And evidence.\"",
      "Lucius Malfoy turned his gaze to Harry Potter then, and his eyes\nsimmered in pure grey fury.",
      "\"If you have deceived me,\" Lucius Malfoy said in tones of low\nanger, \"if all this is a lie, then I will not forgive. But if this\nis not deception... Bring me the proof to convict Dumbledore of\nthis murder before the Wizengamot, or evidence enough to have him\ncast down, and there is nothing that House Malfoy will not do for\nyou, Harry Potter. Nothing.\"",
      "Harry took a deep breath. He needed to sort all this out and\nfigure out the actual probabilities, but he didn't have\ntime. \"If it is Dumbledore, then removing him\nfrom the gameboard leaves a huge hole in Britain's power\nstructure.\"",
      "\"So it does,\" Lucius Malfoy said with a grim smile. \"Did you\nhave ambitions of filling it yourself, Harry Potter?\"",
      "\"Some of your opposition might not like that. They could\nfight.\"",
      "\"They will lose,\" Lucius Malfoy said, now with a face hard like\niron.",
      "\"So this is what I'd want House Malfoy to do for me, Lord\nMalfoy, if Dumbledore gets removed because of me. When the\nopposition is most frightened - that's when they'll be offered a\nlast-minute arrangement to avoid a civil war. Some of your allies\nmight not prefer it, but there'll be a lot of neutrals who'll be\nglad to see stability. The bargain will be that instead of you\ntaking over right away, Draco Malfoy will take power when he comes\nof age.\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" Draco said.",
      "\"Draco has testified under Veritaserum that he tried to help\nHermione Granger. I bet there'd be a lot of people in the\nopposition who'd take a chance on him rather than fight. I'm not\nsure how exactly you'd enforce it - Unbreakable Vows or Gringotts\ncontracts or what - but there'll be some sort of enforceable\ncompact about power going to Draco after he graduates Hogwarts.\nI'll throw any support the Boy-Who-Lived has behind that bargain.\nTry to persuade Longbottom and Bones and so on. Our first plan\npaves the way for that later, if you're careful to act honorable\nwhen you deal with Longbottom and Bones this time around.\"",
      "\"Father, I swear I didn't -\"",
      "Lucius's face twisted into a grim smile. \"I know you didn't,\nson. Well.\" The white-haired man stared across the mighty golden\ntable at Harry Potter. \"Those terms are acceptable to me. But fail\nin any part of our agreement, whether our first bargain, or the\nsecond, and there shall be consequences for you, Harry Potter.\nClever words will not halt that.\"",
      "And Lucius Malfoy signed the parchment.",
      "Mad-Eye Moody had been staring at the bronze door of the\nGringotts meeting room for what seemed like hours, insofar as a man\ncould stare at any one thing when his gaze always saw in all\ndirections.",
      "The trouble with trying to be suspicious of a man like Lucius\nMalfoy, Moody thought, was that you could spend an entire day\nthinking of everything he might be up to, and still not have\nfinished.",
      "The door cracked open and Harry Potter trudged out, small beads\nof sweat still on his forehead.",
      "\"Did you sign anything?\" Mad-Eye demanded upon the instant.",
      "Harry Potter looked at him silently, then reached into his robes\nand drew out a folded parchment. \"The goblins are already executing\nthis,\" said Harry Potter. \"They made three copies before I\nleft.\"",
      "\"MERLIN DAMN IT SON -\" Moody paused as his Eye caught sight of\nthe second half of the document as Harry Potter slowly, as though\nreluctantly, began to unfold the top upward. A glance sufficed to\ntake in the paragraphs drawn in careful handwriting, Lucius\nMalfoy's elegant signature below Harry Potter's. And then Moody\nexploded, even as the top half of the document also began to enter\nhis Sight. \"You exonerate House Malfoy of any\ninvolvement in Hermione Granger's death? Do you have any idea\nwhat you've done, you little fool? Why in Merlin's name would you\ndo something like WHAT -\""

      "Daphne Greengrass walked quietly toward the Greengrass room\nbelow the Slytherin dungeons, the privilege of an Ancient House; on\nher way to drop off her trunk from the Hogwarts Express, before she\njoined the other students for dinner. The whole private area had\nbeen hers alone ever since Malfoy had gone. Her hand, held behind\nher, made repeated come-along gestures at her huge emerald-studded\ntrunk, which seemed hesitant to follow. Maybe the enchantments on\nthe sturdy old family device needed to be reapplied; or maybe her\ntrunk was reluctant to follow her into Hogwarts, which was no\nlonger safe.",
      "There'd been a long talk between Mother and Father, after they'd\nbeen told about Hermione; with Daphne hiding around a doorway to\nlisten, choking back her tears and trying not to make sounds.",
      "Mother had said that the sad fact was that if only one student\ndied every year, well, that still made Hogwarts safer than\nBeauxbatons, let alone Durmstrang. There were more ways for a young\nwitch to die than being murdered. Beauxbatons's Transfiguration\nMaster just wasn't on the same level as McGonagall, Mother had\nsaid.",
      "Father had soberly remarked how important it was for the\nGreengrass heir to stay at Hogwarts where all the other Noble\nfamilies sent their children to school (it was the reason for the\nold tradition of the Noble families synchronizing the birth of\ntheir heirs, to put them in the same year of Hogwarts, if they\ncould). And Father had said that being heiress to a Most Ancient\nHouse meant you couldn't always stay away from trouble.",
      "She could have done without hearing that last part.",
      "Daphne gulped hard, as she turned the doorknob, and opened the\ndoor.",
      "\"Miss Greengrass -\" whispered a shadowy, silvery-robed\nfigure.",
      "Daphne screamed and slammed the door and drew her wand and\nturned to run.",
      "\"Wait!\" cried the voice, now higher and louder.",
      "Daphne paused. That couldn't possibly be who it had\nsounded like.",
      "Slowly, Daphne turned, and opened the door again.",
      "\"You!\" Daphne said in astonishment, as she saw the face\nbeneath the hood. \"I thought you were -\"",
      "\"I come back to you now,\" the silvery-robed figure said in a\nstrong voice, \"at the turn of the -\"",
      "\"What are you doing in my bedroom?\u202f\" shrieked\nDaphne.",
      "\"I heard you can cast the mist form of the Patronus Charm. Can I\nsee?\"",
      "Daphne stared, and then her blood began to burn. \"Why?\" she\nsaid, keeping her wand level. \"So you can kill everyone in\nSlytherin who casts un-Slytherin spells? We all know who\nit was had Hermione killed!\"",
      "The figure's voice rose. \"I testified under Veritaserum that I\ntried to help Miss Granger! I really was trying to help her, when I\ngrabbed her hand on the roof, when I helped her off the floor\n-\"",
      "Daphne kept her wand level. \"Like your father couldn't tamper\nwith the Aurors' record, if he wanted to! I wasn't born yesterday,\nMister Malfoy!\u202f\"",
      "Slowly, as if not to cause alarm, the silver-robed figure drew a\nwand from his robes. Daphne's hand tightened on her own wand, but\nthen she recognized the position of the fingers on the wand, the\nstance the figure was assuming, and she drew a shocked breath -",
      "\"Expecto Patronum!\u202f\"",
      "Silver light leapt from the end of the other's wand - and\ncondensed, forming a shining serpent that seemed to coil in the air\nas though nesting there.",
      "She just gaped.",
      "\"I did try to help Hermione Granger,\" Draco Malfoy said\nwith a level voice. \"Because I know the sickness at the heart of\nSlytherin's House, the reason why so many of us can't cast the\nPatronus Charm any more, is hate. Hate of Muggleborns, or just\nanyone really. People think that's all Slytherin is about now, not\ncunning or ambition or honorable nobility. And I even know, because\nit's obvious if you just look, that Hermione Granger wasn't weak at\nmagic.\"",
      "Daphne's mind had gone completely blank. Her eyes darted around\nnervously, just to check that there wasn't blood coming from under\nthe doors, like the last time Something had Broken.",
      "\"And I've also figured out,\" Draco Malfoy said quietly, as the\nsilver snake went on shining with unmistakeable light and warmth,\n\"that Hermione Granger never really tried to kill me. Maybe she was\nFalse-Memory-Charmed, maybe she was Legilimized, but now that she's\nbeen murdered, it's obvious that Miss Granger was the target in the\nfirst place, when somebody tried to set her up for murdering me\n-\"",
      "\"D-do-do you know what you're saying?\u202f\" Daphne's voice\nbroke. If Lucius Malfoy heard his heir saying that - he'd\nskin Draco and turn him into trousers!",
      "Draco Malfoy smiled, metallic robes gleaming in the light of his\nfull corporeal Patronus; it was a smile both arrogant and\ndangerous, like being turned into a pair of leather pants was\nbeneath his concerns. \"Yes,\" said Draco, \"but it doesn't matter\nnow. House Malfoy is returning House Potter's money and cancelling\nthe debt.\"",
      "Daphne walked over to her bed and then fell on it, hoping she\ncould wake up from the dream once she was in bed.",
      "\"I'd like you to join a conspiracy,\" said the figure in the\nshining robes. \"Everyone in Slytherin who can cast the Patronus\nCharm, and everyone who can learn. That's how we'll know to trust\neach other, when the Silvery Slytherins meet.\" With a dramatic\ngesture, Draco Malfoy cast back his hood. \"But it won't work\nwithout you, Daphne Greengrass. You and your family. Your\nmother will negotiate it with Father, but I'd like the Greengrasses\nto hear the proposal from you, first.\" Draco Malfoy's voice lowered\ngrimly. \"There is much we must speak of, before we eat dinner.\"",
      "Harry Potter had, apparently, taken to being invisible; they'd\nglimpsed his hand only briefly, when he was handing them the list,\nwritten on strange not-parchment. Harry had explained that, all\nthings considered, he didn't really think it was smart for him to\nbe findable except on special occasions, so he was just\ngoing to deal with people as a disembodied floating voice from now\non, or as a brilliant silver light that hid behind corners where\nnobody could see it, and which could always find his friends no\nmatter where they tried to hide. It was, in all honesty, one of the\ncreepiest things which Fred and George had ever heard, over a\nlifetime which had included filling the shoes of every student in\nsecond-year Slytherin with Transfigured live millipedes. Fred and\nGeorge didn't think this could possibly be good for anyone's\nsanity, but they didn't know what to say. It couldn't be denied,\nthey'd seen with their own four eyes, that Hogwarts...",
      "...wasn't safe...",
      "\"I don't know who you went to for the False Memory Charm on Rita\nSkeeter,\" said the sourceless voice of Harry Potter. \"Whoever it\nis... probably won't be able to fill this order directly,\nbut they may know someone who can get things from the Muggle world.\nAnd - I know it may cost extra, but as few people as possible\nshould know that Harry Potter is related to this.\" Another flash of\na small boy's hand, and a bag hit the ground with the clinking\nnoise. \"Some of these items are expensive even in the Muggle world,\nand your contact may have to go outside Britain; but one hundred\nGalleons will be enough to pay for it all, I hope. I'd tell you\nwhere the Galleons came from, but I don't want to spoil tomorrow's\nsurprise.\"",
      "\"What is this stuff?\" said Fred or George, as they\nlooked over the list. \"Our father is a Muggle expert -\"",
      "\"- and we don't recognize half this stuff -\"",
      "\"- why, we don't recognize any of it -\"",
      "\"- just what are you planning to do?\u202f\"",
      "\"Things have become serious,\" Harry's voice said softly. \"I\ndon't know what I'll have to do. I may need the power of the\nMuggles, not just the wizards, before this is done - and I might\nneed it right away, with no time to prepare. I'm not\nplanning to use any of this. I just want it around in case\nof... contingencies.\" Harry's voice paused. \"Obviously I owe you\nmore than I can ever repay and you won't let me give you\nany of what you deserve, I don't even know how to say\nthank you properly, and all I can do is hope that someday when you\ngrow up you'll be more sensible about this whole thing and would\nyou please take a ten percent commission -\"",
      "\"Shut up, you,\" said George or Fred.",
      "\"For God's sake, you went after a troll for me and Fred had his\nribs broken!\"",
      "They both just shook their heads. Harry had stayed behind when\nthey'd told him to run, and stepped forward to distract the troll\nfrom eating George. Harry was the kind of person, they knew, who'd\nthink that something like that didn't cancel out what he owed the\nWeasley twins, that his own deed wasn't properly commensurate. But\nwhat the Weasleys knew, and Harry wouldn't understand until he was\nolder, was that it meant that nothing was owed, or ever could be\nowed between them. It was a strange kind of selfishness, they\nthought, that Harry could understand kindness within himself -\nnever dreaming of asking of money from anyone he'd helped more than\nthey'd helped him, or calling that a debt - while being apparently\nunable to conceive that others might want to act the same way\ntoward him.",
      "\"Remind me to buy you a copy of the Muggle novel Atlas\nShrugged,\" the sourceless voice said. \"I'm starting to\nunderstand what sort of person can benefit from reading it.\"",
      "Monday, April 20th, 7:00pm.",
      "It happened without any intervention or sign from the Head\nTable, as the students had finished their subdued dinner; it\nhappened with no permission or forgiveness asked from the\nProfessors or the Headmaster.",
      "Shortly after the dessert dishes had appeared, a student stood\nup from the Slytherin Table and calmly made his way, not to the\nfront of the Head Table, but toward the opposite side of the Four\nTables of Hogwarts. A few whispers broke out at the sight of the\nwhite-blonde short-cropped hair, as Draco Malfoy stood there,\nsilently regarding all of Hogwarts. Draco Malfoy had said almost\nnothing since his surprise return. The Slytherin had condescended\nneither to confirm nor deny that he had returned because, with\nHermione Granger dead at his family's hand, he no longer had\nanything to fear.",
      "Then Draco Malfoy took up a spoon in one hand, and a glass of\nwater in the other, and began tapping, producing a clear ringing\nsound.",

      "It produced more excited babble at first. At the Head Table, the\nvarious Professors looked in puzzlement toward the Headmaster in\nhis great chair, but the Headmaster gave no sign, and so the\nfaculty did nothing.",
      "Draco Malfoy continued tapping the spoon upon his glass, until\nthe room fell silent, waiting.",
      "Then another student arose from the Ravenclaw table, and made\nhis way to where Draco Malfoy was standing, turning to face\nHogwarts at his side. Breaths were drawn in surprise; those two\nshould have been the bitterest of enemies -",
      "\"I, and my Father, the Lord of the Noble and Most Ancient House\nof Malfoy,\" Draco Malfoy said in a clear voice, \"have come to\nrealize that there are ill forces at work in Hogwarts. That these\nill forces, did wish Hermione Granger harm. That Hermione Granger\nwas perhaps compelled, against her will, to raise her hand against\nour House; or perhaps she and I were both Memory-Charmed. We now\nsay that whoever dared use the heir of Malfoy so, is the enemy of\nHouse Malfoy, upon whom we shall have our vengeance. And that honor\nbe served, we have returned all moneys taken from House Potter, and\ncanceled all debt.\"",
      "Then Harry Potter spoke. \"House Potter acknowledges that it was\nan honest mistake, and holds House Malfoy no ill will. We believe\nand publicly say that House Malfoy was not at fault in Hermione\nGranger's death. Whoever harmed Hermione Granger is the enemy of\nHouse Potter, upon whom we shall have our vengeance. Both of\nus.\"",
      "Then Harry Potter began to walk back to the Ravenclaw table, and\nthe babble of sheer, utter, reality-crashing bewilderment began to\nexplode -",
      "Draco Malfoy resumed tapping his spoon against his waterglass,\ncreating a clear ringing chime.",
      "Ting.",
      "Ting.",
      "Ting.",
      "And other students arose, from other tables, making their way to\nwhere Draco Malfoy stood, arranging themselves at his side, or\nbehind him, or before him.",
      "There was a dread silence in the Great Hall, a sense of the\nworld shifting, of realigning Powers, almost tangible in the\nair.",
      "\"My father, Owen Greengrass, with the consent and full backing\nof my mother, the Lady of the Noble and Most Ancient House of\nGreengrass,\" Daphne Greengrass spoke.",
      "\"And my forefather, Charles, of the House of Nott,\" said the\nformer Lieutenant Nott, once Theodore of Chaos, now standing behind\nDraco Malfoy.",
      "\"And my grand-aunt, Amelia, of the House of Bones, also Director\nof the Department of Magical Law Enforcement,\" said Susan Bones,\nwho stood anext Daphne Greengrass, beside whom she had fought.",
      "\"And my grandmother, Augusta, of the Noble and Most Ancient\nHouse of Longbottom,\" said Neville Longbottom, who had returned for\nthis one night.",
      "\"And my father, Lucius, the Lord Malfoy, of the Noble and Most\nAncient House of Malfoy!\"",
      "\"Together with Alanna Howe constituting a majority of the\nHogwarts Board of Governors!\" Daphne Greengrass said clearly.\n\"Have, to ensure the safety of all students, including their own\nchildren, passed the following Educational Decrees upon the\nHogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!\"",
      "\"First!\" Daphne said. Daphne was trying to keep her trembling\nunder control, as she faced the Four Houses at the forefront of the\nfive. There was only so far her parents' lessons in speech-making\ncould take her. Daphne's eyes darted down quickly to her hand, upon\nwhich, written with a quill in faint red ink, cues to her lines had\nbeen written. \"Students are not to go anywhere alone, not even to\nthe toilets! You will travel in groups of at least three, and every\ngroup must have a sixth-year or seventh-year student!\"",
      "\"Second!\" Susan Bones said from behind her, voice almost firm.\n\"To further ensure the students' safety, nine Aurors have been\ndispatched to Hogwarts to form an Auxiliary Protective Force!\"\nSusan took a small, round glass object from within her robes, one\nof the communicators that the DMLE used, which they'd all been\ngiven. Susan raised it to her mouth and said, her voice now higher,\n\"Auror Brodski, this is Susan Bones. Enter!\u202f\"",
      "The doors to the Hall slammed open, and in marched nine Aurors\nin the reinforced leather gear they used when on duty. At once they\nspread out, two Aurors taking up station by each of the four\ntables, and the last took up watch at the Head Table. There were\nmore gasps.",
      "\"Third!\" said Draco Malfoy, his voice commanding. Malfoy had\napparently memorized his own lines, since there was nothing written\non his hand that Daphne could see. \"In the face of a common enemy\nwho does not balk at killing students from any House, the four\nHouses of Hogwarts must come together and act as one! To emphasize\nthis, the House Points system is temporarily suspended!\nAll Professors will encourage solidarity between Houses,\nby decree of the Hogwarts Board of Governors!\"",
      "\"Fourth!\" recited Neville Longbottom. \"All students not already\nin the Defense Professor's after-school classes, will receive\nspecial training in self-defense by Auror instructors!\"",
      "\"Fifth!\" Theodore Nott yelled in a menacing tone. \"All fighting\nin the corridors or anywhere outside of Defense lessons will be\ndealt with severely! Fight together or don't fight at all!\"",
      "\"Sixth!\" said Daphne Greengrass, and took a deep breath. When\nshe'd found out what was planned, she'd made her own little extra\nrequest to Mother through the Floo. Even with Lucius Malfoy going\nalong with Amelia Bones - a thought her mind was still having\ntrouble grasping - the Greengrass swing vote had still been vital,\nsince Jugson and his own faction had refused to back Malfoy. Not to\nmention that Bones didn't trust Malfoy, and Malfoy didn't trust\nBones. So Mother had demanded, and the Greengrasses had received -\n\"Since Memory Charms have been used on students without setting off\nwards, it is possible that someone on the Hogwarts faculty may be\nimplicated. Therefore! The Auxiliary Protective force reports\ndirectly to my father, Lord Greengrass!\" And this part was only\nsymbolic, she knew, there'd be no reason anyone wouldn't just\ncontact the Aurors directly; but it might turn into more, someday,\nwhich was why she'd asked Mother to demand it - \"And if anyone\nwants to report something to the Auxiliary Protectors, they can\ntalk to the Aurors, or go through me -\" Daphne's arm swept\nbehind her to indicate the gathered students. \"The duly appointed\nPresident of the Auxiliary Protective Special Committee!\"",
      "And Daphne paused dramatically. They'd all rehearsed this\npart.",
      "\"We don't know who the enemy is,\" said Neville, whose voice did\nnot squeak.",
      "\"We don't know what the enemy wants,\" said Theodore, still\nlooking menacing.",
      "\"But we know who the enemy is attacking,\" said Susan, as fierce\nas when she'd taken on three seventh-year students.",
      "\"The enemy is attacking Hogwarts students,\" said Draco Malfoy,\nclear and commanding, like all this was his natural element.",
      "\"And Hogwarts,\" spoke Daphne of Greengrass, feeling her blood\nburn like it never had before in her life, \"is going to fight\nback.\""

      "May 13th, 1992.",
      "Argus Filch's face appeared twisted in the light of the oil lamp\nhe held, shadows dancing over his face. Behind them the doors of\nHogwarts quickly receded, and the dark grounds moved closer. The\ntrack they now walked was muddy and indistinct.",
      "The trees, branches formerly bare with winter, were not yet\nfully clad with spring; their branches stretched up toward the sky\nlike lean fingers, skeletons visible amid the thin foliage. The\nmoon was bright, but clouds scudding across it often threw them\ninto darkness, lit only by the dim flames of Filch's lamp.",
      "Draco kept a firm grip on his wand.",
      "\"Where are you taking us?\" said Tracey Davis. She'd been caught\nalong with Draco by Filch, on their way to an attempted meeting of\nthe Silvery Slytherins after curfew hours, and likewise given a\ndetention.",
      "\"You just follow me,\" said Argus Filch.",
      "Draco was feeling rather annoyed with the whole affair. The\nSilvery Slytherins ought to be recognized school business. There\nwas no reason why a secret conspiracy shouldn't have permission to\nmeet after curfew, if it was for the greater good of Hogwarts. If\nthis happened one more time he'd talk to Daphne Greengrass and\nDaphne would talk to her father and then Filch would learn the\nwisdom of looking the other way where Malfoys were concerned.",
      "The lights of the Hogwarts castle had diminished in the distance\nwhen Filch spoke again. \"I bet you'll think twice about breaking a\nschool rule again, won't you, eh?\" Filch turned his head, away from\nthe lamp, so that he could leer at the four students following him.\n\"Oh yes... hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask\nme... It's just a pity they let the old punishments die out... hang\nyou by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I've got the\nchains still in my office, keep 'em well oiled in case they're ever\nneeded...\"",
      "\"Hey!\" Tracey said, a touch of indignation entering her voice.\n\"I'm too young to hear about that - that sort of - you know!\nEspecially if the chains are well-oiled!\"",
      "Draco wasn't paying attention. Filch simply wasn't in Amycus\nCarrow's league.",
      "Behind them, one of the two older Slytherins following them\nsnickered, though she didn't say anything. Beside her was the\nother, a tall boy with an Slavic cast to his face, and who still\nspoke with an accent. They'd been caught for some unrelated\noffense, having to do with the type of thing Tracey went on about,\nand looked to be in their third or fourth year. \"Pfeh,\" said the\ntaller boy. \"In Durmstrang they hang you upside-down by your toes.\nBy one toe, if you are insolent. Hogwarts was soft even in the old\ndays.\"",
      "Argus Filch was silent for around half a minute, as though\ntrying to think of a proper rejoinder, and then gave a chuckle.\n\"We'll see what you say about that... when you learn what you'll be\ndoing tonight! Ha!\"",
      "\"I said, I'm too young for that sort of thing!\" said\nTracey Davis. \"It has to wait until I'm older!\"",
      "Ahead of them was a cottage with lighted windows, though the\nproportions seemed wrong.",
      "Filch whistled, a high sharp sound, and a dog began barking.",
      "From the cottage stepped forth a figure, making the trees seem\ntoo short around it. The figure was followed by a dog that seemed\nlike a puppy by comparison, until you looked at it apart from the\ntaller silhouette and realized the dog was huge, more like a\nwolf.",
      "Draco's eyes narrowed, before he caught himself. As a Silvery\nSlytherin he wasn't supposed to be Prejudiced against any sentient\nbeing, especially not where other people might see him.",
      "\"What's this?\" said the figure, in the loud gruff voice of the\nhalf-giant. His umbrella lit up with a white glow, brighter than\nFilch's dim lamp. In his other hand he held a crossbow; a quiver of\nshort bolts was strapped to his upper arm.",
      "\"Students serving detention,\" Filch said, loudly. \"They're to\nhelp you search the Forest for\u2026 whatever's been eating 'em.\"",
      "\"The Forest?\u202f\" gasped Tracey. \"We can't go in there at\nnight!\"",
      "\"That's right,\" said Filch, turning from Hagrid to glare at\nthem. \"It's into the Forest you're going, and I'm much mistaken if\nyou'll all come out in one piece.\"",
      "\"But -\" said Tracey. \"There's werewolves, I've heard,\nand vampires, and everyone knows what happens when there's\na girl and a werewolf and a vampire all at the same time!\"",
      "The huge half-giant was frowning. \"Argus, I 'ad in mind you an'\nmaybe a few seventh-years. 'Ere's not much point in bringing along\nhelp if I'm to watch over 'em the whole time.\"",
      "Argus's face lit with cruel satisfaction. \"That's their lookout,\nisn't it? Should've thought of them werewolves before they got in\ntrouble, shouldn't they? Send them out alone. I shouldn't be too\nfriendly to them, Hagrid. They're here to be punished, after\nall.\"",
      "The half-giant gave a massive sigh (it sounded like a normal man\nhaving all the air driven out of his lungs by a Bludgeoning Hex).\n\"Yeh've done yer bit. I'll take over from here.\"",
      "\"I'll be back at dawn,\" said Filch, \"for what's left of them,\"\nhe added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle,\nhis lamp bobbing away in the darkness.",
      "\"Right then,\" said Hagrid, \"now, listen carefully, 'cause it's\ndangerous what we're gonna do tonight an' I don' want no one takin'\nrisks. Follow me over here a moment.\"",
      "He led them to the very edge of the Forest. Holding his lamp up\nhigh he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared\ninto the thick black trees. A light breeze blew over Draco's head\nas he looked into the Forest.",
      "\"There's summat in there that's bin eatin' unicorns,\" the huge\nman said.",
      "Draco nodded; he distantly remembered hearing something along\nthose lines a couple of weeks ago, toward the end of April.",
      "\"Did you call us to track down a trail of silvery blood to a\nwounded unicorn?\" Tracey said excitedly.",
      "\"No,\" said Draco, though he managed to stop the reflexive sneer.\n\"Filch gave us the detention note at lunch today, at noon. Mr.\nHagrid wouldn't wait that long to find a wounded unicorn, and if we\nwere looking for something like that, we'd look in the day when\nit's bright. So,\" Draco held up a finger, like he'd seen Inspector\nLe\u00f3n do in plays, \"I infer that we're looking for something that\nonly comes out at night.\"",
      "\"Aye,\" said the half-giant, sounding thoughtful. \"Yer not what I\nexpected, Draco Malfoy. Not what I expected at all. An' you'd be\nTracey Davis, then. I've heard of yeh. One of poor Miss Granger's\nlot.\" Rubeus Hagrid looked over at the two older Slytherins,\npeering at them in the light of his glowing umbrella. \"An' who'd\nyeh be, again? Don't remember seeing much of yeh, boy.\"",
      "\"Cornelia Walt,\" said the witch, \"and this is Yuri Yuliy,\"\nindicating the Slavic-looking boy who'd spoken of Durmstrang. \"His\nfamily is visiting from the Ukrainian lands, so he's in Hogwarts\njust for the year.\" The older boy nodded, a faintly contemptuous\ncast on his face.",
      "\"This is Fang,\" Hagrid said, indicating the dog.",
      "The five of them set off into the woods.",
      "\"What could be killing unicorns?\" Draco said after they'd walked\nfor a few minutes. Draco knew a bit about Dark creatures, but he\ncouldn't remember anything that was said to prey on unicorns. \"What\nsort of creature does that, does anyone know?\"",
      "\"Werewolves!\" said Tracey.",
      "\"Miss Davis?\" Draco said, and when she looked at him, he\nsilently pointed a finger up at the moon. It was waxing gibbous,\nbut not yet full.",
      "\"Oh, right,\" said Tracey.",
      "\"No weres in the Forest,\" said Hagrid. \"They're plain wizards\nmost o' the time, 'member. Couldn't be wolves either, they're not\nnear fast enough ter catch a unicorn. Powerful magical creatures,\nunicorns are, I never knew one ter be hurt before.\"",
      "Draco listened to this, thinking about the puzzle almost despite\nhimself. \"Then what is fast enough to catch a\nunicorn?\"",
      "\"Wouldn't 'ave been a matter of speed,\" Hagrid said, giving\nDraco an indecipherable glance. \"Ere's no end ter the ways that\ncreatures hunt. Poison, darkness, traps. Imps as can't be seen or\nheard or remembered, even while they're eatin' yer face. Always\nsummat new an' wonderful to learn.\"",
      "A cloud passed over the moon, casting the forest into shadow lit\nonly by the glow of Hagrid's umbrella.",
      "\"Meself,\" Hagrid continued, \"I think we might 'ave a Parisian\nhydra on our 'ands. They're no threat to a wizard, yeh've just got\nto keep holdin' 'em off long enough, and there's no way yeh can\nlose. I mean literally no way yeh can lose so long's yeh keep\nfightin'. Trouble is, against a Parisian hydra, most creatures give\nup long before. Takes a while to cut down all the heads, yeh\nsee.\"",
      "\"Bah,\" said the foreign boy. \"In Durmstrang we learn to fight\nBuchholz hydra. Unimaginably more tedious to fight! I mean\nliterally, cannot imagine. First-years not believe us when we tell\nthem winning is possible! Instructor must give second order,\niterate until they comprehend.\"",
      "They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the\nForest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because\nthe trees were so thick.",
      "Then Draco saw it, thick splashes on the roots of trees,\ngleaming a brighter color beneath the moonlight. \"Is that -\"",
      "\"Unicorn's blood,\" Hagrid said. The huge man's voice was\nsad.",
      "In a clearing ahead, visible through the tangled branches of a\ngreat oak, they saw the fallen creature, splayed beautiful and sad\nupon the ground, the dirt around her shining moon-silver with\npooled blood. The unicorn was not white, but pale blue, or\nappearing so beneath the moon and night sky. Her slender legs stuck\nout at odd angles, obviously broken, and her mane spread across the\ndark leaves, green-black but with a sheen like pearls. On her flank\nwas a small white shape like a starburst, a center surrounded by\neight straight rays. Half her side had been ripped away, the edges\nragged like the marks of teeth, bones and inner organs exposed.",
      "A strange choking sensation rose in Draco's throat.",
      "\"That's 'er,\" Hagrid said, his sad whisper as loud as a normal\nman's voice. \"Just where I found 'er this mornin', dead as a dead\ndoorknob. She is - was - the first unicorn I e'er met in these\nwoods. I called 'er Alicorn, not that it matters ter 'er any more,\nI s'pose.\"",
      "\"You named a unicorn Alicorn,\" said the older girl. Her voice\nwas a bit dry.",
      "\"But she doesn't have wings,\" Tracey said.",
      "\"An alicorn's a unicorn's horn,\" Hagrid said, now louder. \"Don't\nknow where yeh all started thinking it meant a unicorn with wings,\n'ere's no such thing I ever heard. It's just like naming a dog\nFang,\" indicating the huge wolf-like dog that barely came to his\nknees. \"What'd you have called 'er? Hannah, or some such? I gave\n'er a name as would've meant summat ter 'er. Common\ncourtesy, I call it.\"",
      "Nobody said anything to this, and after a further moment, the\nhuge man gave a sharp nod. \"We'll start our search from 'ere, the\nlast place it struck. We're gonna split inter two parties an'\nfollow the trail in diff'rent directions. Yeh two, Walt and Yuliy -\nyeh'll go that way, and take Fang. There's nothin' that lives in\nthe Forest that'll hurt yeh if yer with Fang. Send up green sparks\nif yeh find summat interestin', an' send up red sparks if anyone\ngets in trouble. Davis, Malfoy, with me.\"",
      "The Forest was black and silent. Rubeus Hagrid had dimmed the\nlight of his umbrella after they'd set out, so that Draco and\nTracey had to steer themselves by the light of the moon, not\nwithout occasional trips and falls. They walked past a mossy\ntree-stump, the sound of running water speaking of a stream\nsomewhere close by. Now and then a ray of moonlight through the\nbranches above lit a spot of silver blue blood on the fallen\nleaves; they were following the trail of blood, toward where the\ncreature must have first struck the unicorn.",
      "\"There's rumors about yeh,\" Hagrid said in a low voice after\nthey'd walked for a while.",
      "\"Well, they're all true,\" Tracey said. \"All of\nthem.\"",
      "\"Not yeh,\" Hagrid said. \"Did yeh really testify under\nVeritaserum that yeh tried to help Miss Granger, three times it\nwas?\"",
      "Draco weighed his words for a while, and finally said, \"Yes.\" It\nwouldn't have done to appear too eager to claim credit.",
      "The huge man shook his head, his great feet still stomping\nsilently through the woods. \"I'm surprised, teh be honest. And yeh\ntoo, Davis, tryin' to put the halls in order. Are yeh sure the\nSorting Hat put yeh in the right place? There's not a single witch\nor wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin, so it's always been\nsaid.\"",
      "\"That's not true,\" Tracey said. \"What about Xiaonan Tong the\nBlack Raven, Spencer of the Hill, and Mister Kayvon?\"",
      "\"Who?\" said Hagrid.",
      "\"Just some of the best Dark Wizards from the last two\ncenturies,\" Tracey said. \"They're probably the best from\nHogwarts who weren't from Slytherin.\" Her voice fell, lost its\nenthusiasm. \"Miss Granger always told me I should read up on\nanything I -\"",
      "\"Anyway,\" Draco said quickly, \"that's not really\nrelevant, Mr. Hagrid. Even if -\" Draco worked it around in his\nhead, trying to translate the difference between probability of\nSlytherin given Dark and probability of Dark given\nSlytherin into nonscientific language. \"Even if most Dark\nWizards are from Slytherin, very few Slytherins are Dark Wizards.\nThere aren't all that many Dark Wizards, so not all Slytherins can\nbe one.\" Or as Father had said, while any Malfoy should certainly\nknow much of the secret lore, the more... costly rituals\nwere better left to useful fools like Amycus Carrow.",
      "\"So yeh're saying,\" Hagrid said, \"that most Dark Wizards are\nSlytherins... but...\"",
      "\"But most Slytherins are not Dark Wizards,\" Draco said. He had a\nweary feeling they'd be at this a while, but like fighting a hydra,\nthe important thing was to not give up.",
      "\"I never thought of it that way,\" the huge man said, sounding\nawestruck. \"But, well, if yeh're not all a house of snakes, then\nwhy - get behind that tree!\u202f\"",
      "Hagrid seized Draco and Tracey and hoisted them off the path\nbehind a towering oak. He pulled out a bolt and fitted it into his\ncrossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened.\nSomething was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a\ncloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark\npath, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.",
      "\"I knew it,\" Hagrid murmured. \"There's summat in here that\nshouldn' be.\"",
      "They went after where the rustling sound had come from, with\nHagrid in the lead and Tracey and Draco both gripping their wands\nat the ready, but they found nothing, despite searching in a\nwidening circle with their ears straining for the faintest\nsound.",
      "They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Draco kept looking\nover his shoulder, a feeling nagging at him that they were being\nwatched. They had just passed a bend in the path when Tracey yelled\nand pointed.",
      "In the distance, a shower of red sparks lit the air.",
      "\"You two wait here!\" Hagrid shouted. \"Stay where yeh are, I'll\ncome back for yeh!\"",
      "Before Draco could say a word, Hagrid spun and crashed away\nthrough the undergrowth.",
      "Draco and Tracey stood looking at each other, until they heard\nnothing but the rustling of leaves around them. Tracey looked\nscared, but trying to hide it. Draco was feeling more annoyed than\nanything else. Apparently Rubeus Hagrid, when he had formed his\nplans for tonight, had not spent even five seconds visualizing the\nconsequences if something actually went wrong.",
      "\"Now what?\" said Tracey, her voice a little high.",
      "\"We wait for Mr. Hagrid to come back.\"",
      "The minutes dragged by. Draco's ears seemed sharper than usual,\npicking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. Tracey kept\nlooking up at the moon, as though to reassure herself that it\nwasn't full yet.",
      "\"I'm -\" Tracey whispered. \"I'm getting a little nervous, Mr.\nMalfoy.\"",
      "Draco thought about it a bit. To be honest, there was\nsomething... well, it wasn't that he was a coward, or even that he\nwas scared. But there had been a murder at Hogwarts and if he'd\nbeen watching himself in a play, having just been abandoned in the\nForbidden Forest by a half-giant, he would currently feel like\nyelling at the boy on stage that he should...",
      "Draco reached into his robes, and took out a mirror. Tapping the\nsurface showed a man in red robes, who frowned almost\nimmediately.",
      "\"Auror Captain Eneasz Brodski,\" the man said clearly, causing\nTracey to start with the loudness in the quiet forest. \"What is it,\nDraco Malfoy?\"",
      "\"Put me on ten-minute check-in,\" Draco said. He'd decided not to\ncomplain directly about his detention. He did not want to\nlook like a spoiled brat. \"If I don't respond, come get me. I'm in\nthe Forbidden Forest.\"",
      "Inside the mirror, the Auror's brows rose. \"What are you doing\nin the Forbidden Forest, Mr. Malfoy?\"",
      "\"Looking for the unicorn-eater with Mr. Hagrid,\" Draco said, and\ntapped the mirror off, putting it back in his robes before the\nAuror could ask anything about detentions or say anything about\nserving it out without complaining.",
      "Tracey's head turned toward him, though it was a little too dim\nto read her expression. \"Um, thanks,\" she whispered.",
      "The few leaves which had emerged on their branches rustled as\nanother, colder breeze blew through the forest.",
      "Tracey's voice was a little louder when she spoke again. \"You\ndidn't have to -\" she said, now sounding a little shy.",
      "\"Don't mention it, Miss Davis.\"",
      "The dark silhouette of Tracey put her hand to her cheek, as\nthough to conceal a blush that wasn't visible anyway. \"I mean, not\nfor me -\"",
      "\"No, really,\" Draco said. \"Don't mention it. At all.\" He would\nhave threatened to take out the mirror and order Captain Brodski\nnot to rescue her, but he was afraid she would consider\nthat flirting.",
      "Tracey's silhouetted head turned from him, looked away. Finally\nshe said, in a smaller voice, \"It's too soon, isn't it -\"",
      "A high scream echoed through the woods, a not-quite-human sound,\nthe scream of something like a horse; and Tracey shrieked and\nran.",
      "\"No, you numbskull!\u202f\" yelled Draco, plunging after her.\nThe sound had been so eerie that Draco wasn't certain where it came\nfrom - but he thought that Tracey Davis might, in fact, be running\nstraight toward the source of that eerie scream.",
      "Brambles whipped at Draco's eyes, he had to keep one hand in\nfront of his face to shield them, trying not to lose track of\nTracey because it seemed obvious that, if this was a play, and they\ngot separated, one of them was going to die. Draco thought\nof the mirror secured within his robes but he somehow knew that if\nhe tried to take it out one-handed while running, the mirror would\ninevitably fall and be lost -",
      "Ahead of them, Tracey had stopped, and Draco felt relieved for\nan instant, before he saw.",
      "Another unicorn lay on the ground, surrounded by a slowly\nwidening pool of silver blood, the edge of the blood creeping\nacross the ground like spilled mercury. Her coat was purple, like\nthe color of the night sky, her horn exactly the same twilight\ncolor as her skin, her visible flank marked by a pink star-blotch\nsurrounded by white patches. The sight tore at Draco's heart, even\nmore than the other unicorn because this one's eyes were staring\nglassily right at him, and because there was a -",
      "- blurring, twisting form -",
      "- feeding on an open wound on the unicorn's side, like it was\ndrinking from it -",
      "- Draco couldn't understand, somehow couldn't recognize what he\nwas seeing -",
      "- it was looking at them.",
      "The blurring, seething, unrecognizable darkness seemed to turn\nto regard them. A hiss came from it, like the hiss of the deadliest\nsnake which ever had existed, something more dangerous by far than\nany Blue Krait.",
      "Then it bent back over the wound in the unicorn, and continued\nto drink.",
      "The mirror was in Draco's hand, and it remained lifeless as his\nfinger mechanically tapped at the surface, over and over.",
      "Tracey was holding her wand now, saying things like \"Prismatis\"\nand \"Stupefy\" but nothing was happening.",
      "Then the seething outline rose up, like a man rising to his feet\nonly not so; and it seemed to scuttle forward, moving with a\nstrange half-jump across the dying unicorn's legs, approaching the\ntwo of them.",
      "Tracey tugged at his sleeve and then turned to run, run from\nsomething that could hunt down unicorns. Before she could take\nthree steps there came another terrible hiss, burning his ears, and\nTracey fell to the ground and did not move.",
      "Somewhere in the back of his mind, Draco knew that he was about\nto die. Even if the Auror checked his mirror this very instant,\nthere was no way anyone could get here fast enough. There was no\ntime.",
      "Running hadn't worked.",
      "Magic hadn't worked.",
      "The seething outline came closer, while Draco tried, in his last\nmoments, to solve the riddle.",
      "Then a blazing silver ball of light plunged out of the night sky\nand hung there, illuminating the forest as bright as daylight, and\nthe seething outline leapt backwards, as though in horror of the\nlight.",
      "Four broomsticks plunged out of the sky, three Aurors with\nbright multicolored shields and Harry Potter holding his wand\naloft, seated behind Professor McGonagall within a larger\nshield.",
      "\"Get out of here!\" roared Professor McGonagall -",
      "- an instant before the seething thing gave forth another\nterrible hiss, and all the shielding spells winked out. The three\nAurors and Professor McGonagall fell off their broomsticks and\ndropped heavily to the forest floor, lying motionless.",
      "Draco couldn't breathe, the most intense fear he'd ever felt\nin his life gripping all through his chest, sending tendrils around\nhis heart.",
      "Harry Potter, who had remained untouched, silently guided\nhis broomstick toward the ground -",
      "- and then leapt off to stand between Draco and the seething\noutline, interposing himself like a living shield.",
      "\"Run!\" said Harry Potter, turning his head half-back to look\nat Draco. The silver moonlight gleamed on his face. \"Run, Draco!\nI'll hold it off!\"",
      "\"You can't fight that thing alone!\" Draco cried aloud. A\nnausea was in his stomach, a churning sensation that, looking back\nin memory, seemed both like and unlike a sense of guilt, as though\nit had the sensations but not quite all of the emotion.",
      "\"I must,\" Harry Potter said grimly. \"Go!\"",
      "\"Harry, I - I'm sorry, for everything - I\" Though later,\nlooking back, Draco couldn't quite remember what he'd meant to\napologize for, maybe it'd been that he was planning to overthow\nHarry's conspiracy, all that time ago.",
      "The seething figure, now seeming blacker and more terrible,\nrose up into the air, hovering off the ground.",
      "\"GO!\" shouted Harry.",
      "Draco turned and fled headlong into the woods,with the\nbranches whipping at his face. Behind him, Draco heard another\nterrible hiss, and Harry's voice rising, crying something that\nDraco couldn't make out from the distance; Draco turned his head\nfor only an instant to look back, and in that moment ran into\nsomething, hitting his head HARD, and blacked out.",
      "Harry held a tight grip on his wand, a Prismatic Sphere glowing\naround him. He stared levelly at the seething, blurring form in\nfront of him, and said, \"What on Earth are you doing?\"",
      "The seething blurs resolved, reformed, relaxed back into a\nhooded form. Whatever concealment had been at work - a device\nrather than a Charm, Harry guessed, since the magic had been able\nto affect him - had prevented his mind from recognizing the shape\nor even that the shape was human. But it hadn't prevented Harry\nfrom recognizing the sharp sense of doom.",
      "Professor Quirrell stood straight with silver blood all down the\nfront of his enshrouding black cloak, and gave a sigh, looking at\nthe fallen forms of three Aurors, Tracey Davis, Draco Malfoy, and\nProfessor McGonagall. \"I had honestly thought,\" Professor Quirrell\nmurmured, \"that I jammed that mirror without alarm. What were two\nfirst-year Slytherins doing alone in the Forbidden Forest? Mr.\nMalfoy has more sense than this... What a fiasco.\"",
      "Harry didn't answer. The sense of doom was as strong as Harry\ncould ever remember feeling it, a feeling of power in the air so\ngreat that it was almost tangible. Some part of him was still\nviscerally shocked at how fast the shields surrounding the Aurors\nhad been torn apart. He almost hadn't been able to see the\nsuccessive lashes of color which had torn away the shields like\ntissue paper. It made the duel Professor Quirrell had fought\nagainst the Auror in Azkaban look like a mockery, a child's game -\nthough Professor Quirrell had claimed, then, that if he'd fought\nfor real the Auror would have been dead in seconds; and Harry knew\nnow that this was also true.",
      "Just how high did the power ladder go?",
      "\"I take it,\" Harry said, managing to keep his voice steady,\n\"that your eating unicorns has something to do with why you'll get\nfired from the Defense Professor position. I don't suppose you'd\ncare to explain in considerable detail?\"",
      "Professor Quirrell looked at him. The almost tangible sense of\npower in the air seemed to diminish, drawing back into the Defense\nProfessor. \"I shall indeed explain myself,\" the Defense Professor\nsaid. \"I need to cast a few Memory Charms first, and then we may go\noff and discuss it, for it would not be wise for me to stay. You\nwill return to this time later, as I know.\"",
      "Harry willed himself to be able to see through the Cloak he had\nmastered; and knew that another Harry stood beside him, hidden by\nhis own Deathly Hallow. Harry then told his Cloak to hide himself\nfrom himself once more, and it did; being able to perceive your\nfuture self meant having to match the memory later.",
      "Harry's own voice said, then, sounding strange in\npresent-Harry's ears, \"He has a surprisingly good explanation.\"",
      "Present-Harry remembered the words as best he could. Nothing\nmore was said between them.",
      "Professor Quirrell walked to Draco's form, and chanted the spell\nof the False Memory Charm. The Defense Professor stood there for\nperhaps a minute, seemingly lost to the world.",
      "Harry had been studying Obliviations, these last couple of weeks\n- though he couldn't have helped cast the spells, unless he was\nwilling to exhaust himself almost completely, and for some reason\nthey wanted an Auror to lose every single life memory involving the\ncolor blue. But Harry had some idea, now, of the concentration\nwhich the far more difficult False Memory Charm entailed. You had\nto try to live the other person's entire life inside your own head,\nat least if you wanted to create the False Memories with less than\na sixteen-to-one slowdown as you separately crafted sixteen major\ntracks of memory. It might have been quiet, there might have been\nno outward sign; but Harry knew something of the difficulties now,\nand he knew to be impressed.",
      "Professor Quirrell finished, and moved on to Tracey Davis, then\nthe three Aurors, and finally Professor McGonagall. Harry waited,\nbut future-Harry made no protest. It was possible that even\nProfessor McGonagall, if she'd been awake, wouldn't have protested.\nIt was not yet the Ides of May, and apparently there would be a\nsurprisingly good explanation.",
      "With a gesture, Draco's stunned body was lifted, and sent a\nshort distance into the woods, before being carefully deposited on\nthe ground. Then a final gesture from Professor Quirrell ripped a\nhuge chunk out of the unicorn's side, leaving behind ragged edges;\nthe raw meat hovered in the air, then wavered in Vanishment and was\ngone.",
      "\"Done,\" Professor Quirrell said. \"I must depart this place now,\nMr. Potter. Come with me, and remain here.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell strode away, and Harry followed and remained\nbehind.",
      "They walked through the woods in silence for a time, before\nHarry heard faint voices in the distance. The next set of Aurors,\npresumably, after the first set had fallen out of contact. What his\nfuture self was saying, Harry didn't know.",
      "\"They won't detect us, nor hear our speech,\" said Professor\nQuirrell. The sense of power and doom around the Defense Professor\nwas still strong. The man seated himself on a tree stump, one where\nthe light of the almost-full moon fell full on him. \"I should first\nsay that when you speak to the Aurors, in the future, you should\ntell them that you frightened away the seething dark, the same as\nyou did that Dementor. It is what Mr. Malfoy will remember seeing.\"\nProfessor Quirrell gave a small sigh. \"It may cause some alarm, if\nthey conclude that some horror kin to Dementors, and strong enough\nto break the Aurors' shields, is loose in the Forbidden Forest. But\nI could not think of what else to do. If the forest is\nbetter-guarded after this - but with any luck I have already\nconsumed what I need. Would you mind telling me how you arrived so\nquickly? How did you know Mr. Malfoy was in trouble?\"",
      "After Captain Brodski had learned that Draco Malfoy was in the\nForbidden Forest, seemingly in the company of Rubeus Hagrid,\nBrodski had begun inquiring to find out who had authorized this,\nand had still been unable to find out when Draco Malfoy had missed\ncheck-in. Despite Harry's protests, the Auror Captain, who was\nauthorized to know about Time-Turners, had refused to allow\ndeployment to before the time of the missed check-in; there were\nstandard procedures involving Time. But Brodski had given Harry\nwritten orders allowing him to go back and deploy an Auror trio to\narrive one second after the missed check-in time. There had been a\nPatronus Charm to locate Draco, which Harry had successfully willed\nto take the form of a ball of pure silver light, and the flight of\nAurors had arrived on time to the second.",
      "\"I'm afraid I couldn't say,\" Harry replied evenly. Professor\nQuirrell was still a major suspect, and it was good for him not to\nknow the details. \"Now why are you eating unicorns?\"",
      "\"Ah,\" Professor Quirrell said. \"As to that\u2026\" The man hesitated.\n\"I was drinking the blood of unicorns, not eating them. The missing\nflesh, the ragged marks upon the body - those were to obscure the\ncase, to make it seem like some other predator. The use of\nunicorn's blood is too well-known.\"",
      "\"I don't know it,\" Harry said.",
      "\"I know you do not,\" the Defense Professor said sharply. \"Or you\nwould not be pestering me about it. The power of unicorn's blood is\nto preserve your life for a time, even if you are on the very verge\nof death.\"",
      "There was a stretch of time when Harry's brain claimed to be\nrefusing to process the words, which was of course a lie, because\nyou couldn't know the meaning you weren't allowed to process,\nwithout having already processed it.",
      "A strange sense of blankness overtook Harry, an absence of\nreaction, maybe this was what other people felt like when someone\nwent off-script, and they couldn't say or think of anything to\ndo.",
      "Of course Professor Quirrell was dying, not just occasionally\nill.",
      "Professor Quirrell had known he was dying. He'd volunteered to\ntake the Defense Professor position at Hogwarts, after all.",
      "Of course he'd been getting worse the whole school year. Of\ncourse illnesses which kept getting worse had a predictable\ndestination at their end.",
      "Harry's brain had surely known already, somewhere in the safe\nback of his mind where he could refuse to process things he'd\nalready processed.",
      "Of course that was why Professor Quirrell wouldn't be able to\nteach Battle Magic next year. Professor McGonagall wouldn't even\nhave to fire him. He would just be -",
      "- dead.",
      "\"No,\" Harry said, his voice a little shaky. \"There has to be a\nway -\"",
      "\"I am not stupid nor particularly eager to die. I have already\nlooked. I had to go this far simply to last out my lesson plans,\nhaving less time than I had thought, and -\" The head of the dark\nmoonlit figure turned away. \"I think I do not want to hear about\nit, Mr. Potter.\"",
      "Harry's breath hitched. Too many emotions were bubbling up in\nhim at once. After denial came anger, according to a ritual someone\nhad just made up. And yet it seemed surprisingly appropriate.",
      "\"And why -\" Harry's breath hitched again. \"Why isn't unicorn's\nblood standard in healer's kits, then? To keep someone alive, even\nif they're on the very verge of dying from their legs being\neaten?\"",
      "\"Because there are permanent side effects,\" Professor Quirrell\nsaid quietly.",
      "\"Side effects? Side effects? What kind of side effect\nis medically worse than DEATH?\u202f\" Harry's voice rose on the\nlast word until he was shouting.",
      "\"Not everyone thinks the same way we do, Mr. Potter. Though, to\nbe fair, the blood must come from a live unicorn and the unicorn\nmust die in the drinking. Would I be here otherwise?\"",
      "Harry turned, stared at the surrounding trees. \"Have a herd of\nunicorns at St. Mungos. Floo the patients there, or use\nportkeys.\"",
      "\"Yes, that would work.\"",
      "Harry's face tightened, the only outward sign behind his\ntrembling hands of everything that was welling up inside him. He\nneeded to scream, needed some outlet, needed something he\ncouldn't name and finally Harry leveled his wand at a tree and\nshouted \"Diffindo!\u202f\"",
      "There was a sharp tearing sound, and a cut appeared across the\nwood.",
      "\"Diffindo!\"",
      "Another cut. Harry had learned the Charm only ten days\npreviously, after he'd started getting serious about self-defense.\nIt was theoretically a second-year Charm, but the anger pouring\nthrough him seemed to know no bounds, he knew enough now not to\nexhaust himself and he still had power yet.",
      "\"Diffindo!\u202f\" Harry had aimed at a branch this time, and\nit plummeted to the ground with a sound of twigs and leaves.",
      "There didn't seem to be any tears inside him, only pressure with\nno outlet.",
      "\"I shall leave you to it,\" Professor Quirrell said quietly. The\nDefense Professor rose from his tree stump, the unicorn's blood\nstill moonlit on the black cloak he wore, and drew his hood back\nover his head."

      "Harry stood, panting, in the midst of a brief wasted circle amid\nthe forest, more destruction than a first-year should have been\nable to reach, by himself. The Severing Charm wouldn't bring down a\ntree, so he'd started partially Transfiguring cross-sections\nthrough the wood. It hadn't let out what was inside him, bringing\ndown a small circle of trees hadn't made him feel any better, all\nthe emotions were still there but while he was destroying trees he\nat least wasn't thinking about how the feelings couldn't be let\nout.",
      "After Harry had run out of available magic he'd started tearing\noff branches with his bare hands and snapping them. His hands were\nbleeding, though nothing that Madam Pomfrey couldn't fix in the\nmorning. Only Dark magic left permanent scars on wizards.",
      "There came a sound of something moving in the woods, like the\nhoofbeats of a horse, and Harry whirled, his wand rising once more;\nsome part of his magic had returned while he was working with his\nhands. It occurred to him for the first time that he was out in the\nForbidden Forest alone, and making noise.",
      "What emerged into the moonlight was not the unicorn Harry had\nexpected, but a creature with a lower body like that of a horse,\ngleaming white-brown beneath the moonlight, and the bare upper\nchest of a male human with long white hair. The moonlight caught\nthe centaur's face, and Harry saw that the eyes were almost as blue\nas Dumbledore's, halfway to sapphire.",
      "In one hand the centaur held a long wooden spear, with an\noverlarge metal blade whose edge did not gleam beneath the\nmoonlight; a gleaming edge, Harry had once read, was the sign of a\ndull blade.",
      "\"So,\" the centaur said. His voice was low, powerful and male.\n\"Here you are, surrounded by destruction. I can smell the unicorn's\nblood in the air, the blood of something innocent, slain to save\noneself.\"",
      "A jolt of sudden fear brought Harry into the now, and he said\nquickly, \"It's not what it looks like.\"",
      "\"I know. The stars themselves proclaim your innocence,\nironically enough.\" The centaur took a step toward Harry within the\nsmall clearing, still holding his spear upright. \"A strange word,\ninnocence. It means lack of knowledge, like the innocence\nof a child, and also means lack of guilt. Only those entirely\nignorant can lack all responsibility for the consequences of their\nactions. He knows not what he does, and therefore can be without\nharmful intent; so says that word.\" The deep voice did not echo in\nthe woods.",
      "Harry's eyes flickered to the spear-tip, and he realized that he\nshould have grabbed his Time-Turner the moment he saw the centaur.\nNow, if Harry tried to reach beneath his robes, the spear could\nstrike him before then, if the centaur was fast enough. \"I read\nonce,\" Harry said, his voice a bit unsteady as he tried to match\ndeep-sounding words to deep-sounding words, \"that it's wrong to\nthink of little children as innocent, because not knowing isn't the\nsame as not choosing. That children do little harms to each other\nwith schoolyard fights, because they don't have the power to do\ngreat harm. And some adults do great harm. But the adults who\ndon't, aren't they more innocent than children, not less?\"",
      "\"The wisdom of wizards,\" the centaur said.",
      "\"Muggle wisdom, actually.\"",
      "\"Of the magicless I know little. Mars has been dim of late, but\nit grows brighter.\" The centaur took another step forwards,\nbringing him almost within striking distance of Harry.",
      "Harry didn't dare look up to the sky. \"That means Mars is coming\ncloser to the Earth, as both planets go around the Sun. Mars is\nreflecting the same amount of sunlight as always, it's just getting\nnearer to us. What do you mean, the stars proclaim my\ninnocence?\"",
      "\"The night sky speaks to centaurs. It is how we know what we\nknow. Or do they not even tell wizards that much, these days?\" A\nlook of contempt crossed the centaur's face.",
      "\"I... tried to look up centaurs, when I was checking out\nDivination. Most of the authors just ridiculed centaur Divination\nwithout explaining why, wizards don't understand argumentative\nnorms, to them ridiculing an idea or a person feels like casting\nthat idea down just as much as bringing evidence against it... I\nthought the part about centaurs using astrology was just more\nridicule...\"",
      "\"Why?\" the centaur intoned. His head cocked curiously.",
      "\"Because the course of the planets is predictable for thousands\nof years in advance. If I talked to the right Muggles, I could show\nyou a diagram of exactly what the planets will look like from this\nspot ten years later. Would you be able to make predictions from\nthat?\"",
      "The centaur shook his head. \"From a diagram? No. The light of\nthe planets, the comets, the subtle shifts in the stars themselves,\nthose I would not see.\"",
      "\"Cometary orbits are also set thousands of years in advance so\nthey shouldn't correlate much to current events. And the light of\nthe stars takes years to travel from the stars to Earth, and the\nstars don't move much at all, not visibly. So the obvious\nhypothesis is that centaurs have a native magical talent for\nDivination which you just, well, project onto the night\nsky.\"",
      "\"Perhaps,\" the centaur said thoughtfully. His head lowered. \"The\nothers would strike you for saying such a thing, but I have ever\nsought to know what I do not know. Why the night sky can foretell\nthe future - that I surely do not know. It is hard enough to grasp\nthe skill itself. All I can say, son of Lily, is that even if what\nyou are saying is true, it does not seem useful.\"",
      "Harry allowed himself to relax a little; being addressed as 'son\nof Lily' implied that the centaur thought of him as more than a\nrandom intruder in the forest. Besides, attacking a Hogwarts\nstudent would probably bring some kind of huge reprisal upon the\nnon-wizard centaur tribe in the forests, and the centaur probably\nknew that... \"What Muggles have learned is that there is a power in\nthe truth, in all the pieces of the truth which interact with each\nother, which you can only find by discovering as many truths as\npossible. To do that you can't defend false beliefs in any way, not\neven by saying the false belief is useful. It might not seem to\nmatter whether your predictions are really based on the stars or if\nit's an innate talent being projected. But if you wanted to really\nunderstand Divination, or for that matter the stars, the real truth\nabout centaur predictions would be a fact that matters to other\ntruths.\"",
      "Slowly the centaur nodded. \"So the wandless have become wiser\nthan the wizards. What a joke! Tell me, son of Lily, do the Muggles\nin their wisdom say that soon the skies will be empty?\"",
      "\"Empty?\" Harry said. \"Er... no?\"",
      "\"The other centaurs in this forest have stayed from your\npresence, for we are sworn not to set ourselves against the\nheavens' course. Because, in becoming entangled in your fate, we\nmight become less innocent in what is to come. I alone have dared\napproach you.\"",
      "\"I... don't understand.\"",
      "\"No. You are innocent, as the stars say. And to slay something\ninnocent to save oneself, that is a terrible deed. One would live\nonly a cursed life, a half-life, from that day. For any centaur\nwould surely be cast out, if he slew a foal.\"",
      "The spear made a lightning motion, too fast for Harry's eyes to\nfollow, and smashed his wand out of his hand.",
      "Another powerful blow smashed into Harry's solar plexus, and he\nwent gasping and retching to the forest floor.",
      "Harry's hand reached up toward his robes, for his Time-Turner,\nand the spear-butt knocked his hand away, almost hard enough to\nbreak fingers, he reached with his other hand and that was knocked\naway too -",
      "\"I am sorry, Harry Potter,\" the centaur said, and then looked up\nwith widened eyes. The spear spun about and came up, intercepting a\nred spellbolt. Then the centaur dropped the spear and leaped away\ndesperately, a green flash of light went past him and another green\nflash of light followed in its wake, then a third green flash hit\nthe centaur straight-on.",
      "The centaur fell and did not move again.",
      "It took a long time for Harry to catch his breath, to stagger to\nhis feet, to pick up his wand, to croak, \"What?\"",
      "By that time the sense of doom, of power almost tangible in the\nair, had approached once more.",
      "\"P-Professor Quirrell? What are you doing here?\"",
      "\"Well,\" the man in the black cloak said thoughtfully,\n\"you needed to fly into a rage and have a loud tantrum in\nthe Forbidden Forest in the middle of the night, and I\nneeded to go just outside your ability to detect me and keep watch.\nOne does not leave a student alone in the Forbidden Forest. That\nshould be obvious in retrospect.\"",
      "Harry stared at the fallen centaur.",
      "The horse-form wasn't breathing.",
      "\"You - you killed him, that was Avada Kedavra -\"",
      "\"I do not always understand how other people imagine morality to\nwork, Mr. Potter. But even I know that on conventional morality, it\nis acceptable to kill nonhuman creatures which are about to slay a\nwizard child. Perhaps you do not care about the nonhuman part, but\nhe was about to kill you. He was hardly innocent -\"",
      "The Defense Professor stopped, looking at Harry, who had raised\none trembling hand to his mouth.",
      "\"Well,\" the Defense Professor said then, \"I have made my point,\nand you may think on it. Centaur spears can block many spells, but\nno one tries to block if they see that the spell is a certain shade\nof green. For this purpose it is useful to know some green stunning\nhexes. Really, Mr. Potter, you should understand by now how I\noperate.\"",
      "The Defense Professor came nearer the centaur's body, and Harry\ntook an involuntary step back, then another, at the terrible rising\nsense of STOP, DON'T -",
      "The Defense Professor kneeled and pressed his wand to the\ncentaur's head.",
      "The wand stayed there for a time.",
      "And the centaur rose, eyes blank, breathing once more.",
      "\"Remember nothing of this time,\" the Defense Professor\ncommanded. \"Wander away and forget everything about this\nnight.\"",
      "The centaur walked away, the four horse-legs moving in strange\nsynchrony.",
      "\"Happy now?\" the Defense Professor said, sounding rather\nsardonic about it.",
      "Harry's brain still felt broken. \"He was trying to kill\nme.\"",
      "\"Oh, for Merlin's sake - yes, he was trying to kill you. Get\nused to it. Only boring people never have that experience.\"",
      "Harry's voice emerged, hoarse. \"Why - why did he want to -\"",
      "\"Any number of reasons. I would be lying if I said I'd never\nconsidered killing you myself.\"",
      "Harry stared at where the centaur had wandered into the\ntrees.",
      "His brain still felt half-broken, like an engine misfiring, but\nHarry did not see how this could possibly be a good sign.",
      "The news of Draco Malfoy nearly being eaten by a horror had been\nsufficient to summon back Dumbledore from wherever he'd gone, to\nwake Lord Malfoy and the Lady Greengrass's handsome husband, to\nbring forth Amelia Bones. The supposed presence of the horror had\nprovoked skepticism even from Dumbledore, and the possibility of\nFalse Memory Charms had been raised. Harry had said (after some\ninternal debate about the consequences of people believing a demon\nwas on the loose) that he didn't actually remember making the same\neffort he'd put forth to frighten the Dementor, the dark thing had\njust left; which was what you would expect someone to create as a\nFalse Memory, if they hadn't actually known how Harry had done it.\nThe names of Bellatrix Black, Severus Snape, and Quirinus Quirrell\nhad been mentioned in connection with wizards strong enough to\nsubdue everyone present and cast False Memory Charms, and Harry had\nknown that Lucius was thinking of Dumbledore. There had been Aurors\ntestifying, and discussions going in circles, and glares of\naccusation, and cutting remarks at 2AM in the morning. There had\nbeen motions, and votes, and consequences.",
      "\"Do you believe,\" Headmaster Dumbledore said quietly to Harry,\nwhen all of it was done, and the two of them alone, \"that the\nHogwarts you have wrought is an improvement?\"",
      "Harry sat with his elbows on his knees, his face resting on his\npalms, in the conference room from which all the others had now\ndeparted. Professor McGonagall, who did not use a Time-Turner as\nroutinely as the two of them, had departed swiftly for her bed.",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry answered after too long a hesitation. \"From my\nperspective, Headmaster, things in Hogwarts are finally, finally\nnormal. This is how things should be, when four children get sent\ninto the Forbidden Forest at night. There should be a huge fuss,\nconstables showing up, and the responsible party getting\nsacked.\"",
      "\"You believe it is good,\" Dumbledore said quietly, \"that the man\nwho you call responsible was, as you put it, sacked.\"",
      "\"Yes, in fact, I do.\"",
      "\"Argus Filch has served this institution for decades.\"",
      "\"And when given Veritaserum,\" Harry said tiredly, \"Argus Filch\nrevealed that he had sent an eleven-year-old boy into the Forbidden\nForest, hoping something awful would happen to him, because he\nthought the boy's father had been responsible for the death of his\ncat. The three other students in Draco's company don't seem to have\nfazed him. I would have argued for jail time, but your concept of\njail in this country is Azkaban. I'll also note that Filch was\nremarkably unpleasant to the children in Hogwarts and I expect the\nschool's hedonic index to be improved by his departure, not that it\nmatters to you, I suppose.\"",
      "The Headmaster's eyes were impenetrable behind the half-moon\nglasses. \"Argus Filch is a Squib. His work at Hogwarts is all he\nhas. Had, rather.\"",
      "\"The purpose of a school is not to provide work for its\nemployees. I know you probably spent more time around Filch than\naround any individual student, but that shouldn't make Filch's\ninner experiences loom larger in your thoughts. Students have inner\nlives too.\"",
      "\"You don't care at all, do you Harry?\" Dumbledore's voice was\nquiet. \"About those you hurt.\"",
      "\"I care about the innocent,\" Harry said. \"Like Mr. Hagrid, who\nyou'll note I argued should not be considered malicious, just\noblivious. I was fine with Mr. Hagrid working here so long as he\ndidn't take anyone into the Forbidden Forest again.\"",
      "\"I had thought that with Rubeus vindicated, he might teach Care\nof Magical Creatures after Silvanus departs the position. But much\nof that teaching is done in the Forbidden Forest. So that too shall\nnot be, in the wake of your passage.\"",
      "Harry said slowly, \"But - you told us that Mr. Hagrid has a\nblind spot when it comes to magical creatures threatening wizards.\nThat Mr. Hagrid had a cognitive deficit and couldn't really imagine\nDraco and Tracey getting hurt, which was why Mr. Hagrid didn't see\nanything wrong with leaving them alone in the Forbidden Forest at\nnight. Was that not true?\"",
      "\"It is true.\"",
      "\"Then wouldn't Mr. Hagrid be the worst possible teacher for\nMagical Creatures?\"",
      "The old wizard gazed down at Harry through the half-moon\nglasses. His voice was thick when he spoke. \"Mr. Malfoy himself saw\nnothing awry. It was not so implausible a trick which Argus played,\nHarry Potter. And Rubeus might have grown into his position. It\nwould have been - all Rubeus wished, his one greatest desire -\"",
      "\"Your mistake,\" Harry said, looking down at his knees, feeling\nat least ten percent as exhausted as he'd ever been, \"is a\ncognitive bias we would call, in the trade, scope insensitivity.\nFailure to multiply. You're thinking about how happy Mr. Hagrid\nwould be when he heard the news. Consider the next ten years and a\nthousand students taking Magical Creatures and ten percent of them\nbeing scalded by Ashwinders. No one student would be hurt as much\nas Mr. Hagrid would be happy, but there'd be a hundred students\nbeing hurt and only one happy teacher.\"",
      "\"Perhaps,\" the old wizard said. \"And your own error, Harry, is\nthat you do not feel the pain of those you hurt, once you have done\nyour multiplication.\"",
      "\"Maybe.\" Harry went on staring at his knees. \"Or maybe it's\nworse than that. Headmaster, what does it mean if a centaur doesn't\nlike me?\" What does it mean when a member of a race of magical\ncreatures known for Divination gives you a lecture on people who\nare ignorant of consequences, apologizes, and then tries to stab\nyou with a spear?",
      "\"A centaur?\" the Headmaster said. \"When did you - ah, the\nTime-Turner. You are the reason why I could not travel back to\nbefore the event, on pain of paradox.\"",
      "\"Am I? I guess I am.\" Harry shook his head distantly.\n\"Sorry.\"",
      "\"With very few exceptions,\" Dumbledore said, \"centaurs do not\nlike wizards, at all.\"",
      "\"This was a bit more specific than that.\"",
      "\"What did the centaur say to you?\"",
      "Harry didn't reply.",
      "\"Ah.\" The Headmaster hesitated. \"Centaurs have been wrong many\ntimes, and if there is anyone in the world who could confuse the\nstars themselves, it is you.\"",
      "Harry looked up, and saw the blue eyes once more gentle behind\nthe half-circle glasses.",
      "\"Do not fret too much about it,\" said Albus Dumbledore."

      "June 3rd, 1992.",
      "Professor Quirrell was very sick.",
      "He'd seemed better for a while, after drinking his unicorn's\nblood in May, but the air of intense power which had surrounded him\nafterward hadn't lasted even a day. By the Ides of May, Professor\nQuirrell's hands had been trembling again, though subtly. The\nDefense Professor's medical regimen had been interrupted too early,\nit seemed.",
      "Six days ago Professor Quirrell had collapsed at dinnertime.",
      "Madam Pomfrey had tried to forbid Professor Quirrell from\nteaching classes, and Professor Quirrell had shouted at her in\nfront of everyone. The Defense Professor had shouted that he was\ndying regardless, and would use his remaining time as he chose.",
      "So Madam Pomfrey, blinking hard, had forbidden the Defense\nProfessor from doing anything except teaching his classes.\nShe'd asked for a volunteer to help her take Professor Quirrell to\na room in the Hogwarts infirmary. More than a hundred students had\nrisen to their feet, only half wearing green.",
      "The Defense Professor no longer sat at the Head Table during\nmealtimes. He didn't cast spells during lessons. The oldest\nstudents who had the most Quirrell points helped him to teach, the\nseventh-years who had already sat their Defense N.E.W.T.s in May.\nThey took turns floating him from his room in the infirmary to his\nclasses, and brought him food at mealtimes. Professor Quirrell\nproctored his Battle Magic classes from a chair, sitting.",
      "Watching Hermione die had hurt more than this, but that had\nended much more quickly.",
      "This is the true Enemy.",
      "Harry had already thought that, after Hermione had died. Being\nforced to watch Professor Quirrell die, day by day, week by week,\nhad not done much to change his mind.",
      "This is the true Enemy I have to face, Harry thought in\nWednesday's Defense class, watching Professor Quirrell leaning far\nto one side of his chair before that day's seventh-year assistant\ncaught him. Everything else is just shadows and\ndistraction.",
      "Harry had been turning over Trelawney's prophecy in his mind,\nwondering if maybe the true Dark Lord had nothing to do with Lord\nVoldemort at all. Born to those who have thrice defied him\nseemed to strongly invoke the Peverell brothers and the three\nDeathly Hallows - though Harry didn't exactly see how Death could\nhave marked him as an equal, which seemed to imply some sort of\ndeliberate action on Death's part.",
      "This alone is the true Enemy, Harry thought. After\nthis will come Professor McGonagall, Mum and Dad, even Neville in\nhis time, unless the wound in the world can be healed before\nthen.",
      "There was nothing Harry could do. Madam Pomfrey was already\ndoing for Professor Quirrell what magic could do, and magic seemed\nstrictly superior to Muggle techniques when it came to healing.",
      "There was nothing Harry could do.",
      "Nothing he could do.",
      "Nothing.",
      "Nothing at all.",
      "Harry raised his hand, and knocked upon the door, in case the\nperson there could no longer detect him.",
      "\"What is it?\" came a strained voice from the infirmary room.",
      "\"It's me.\"",
      "There was a long pause. \"Come in,\" said that voice.",
      "Harry slipped inside and closed the door behind him, and cast\nthe Quieting Charm. He stood as far away from Professor Quirrell as\nhe could, just in case his own magic was making the Professor feel\nuncomfortable.",
      "Though the sense of doom was fading, fading with each passing\nday.",
      "Professor Quirrell was lying back in his infirmary bed, only his\nhead propped up by a pillow. A coverlet of cottony material, red\nwith black stitching, covered him to his chest. A book hovered\nbefore his eyes, outlined in a pale glow which also surrounded a\nblack cube lying by the bed. Not the Defense Professor's own magic,\nthen, but a device of some kind.",
      "The book was Thinking Physics by Epstein, the same book\nHarry had lent to Draco a few months back. Harry had stopped\nfretting about its possible misuse several weeks earlier.",
      "\"This -\" Professor Quirrell said, and coughed, it didn't sound\nquite right. \"This is a fascinating book... if I'd ever\nrealized...\" A laugh, mixed with another cough. \"Why did I assume\nthe Muggle arts... must not be mine? That they would be... of no\nuse to me? Why did I never bother trying... to test it\nexperimentally... as you would say? In case... my assumption... was\nwrong? It seems sheerly foolish of me... in retrospect...\"",
      "Harry was having more trouble speaking than Professor Quirrell\nwas. Wordlessly, Harry reached into his pocket, and laid a kerchief\non the floor; which he unfolded to reveal a small white pebble,\nsmooth and round.",
      "\"What's that?\" said the Defense Professor.",
      "\"It's a, it's a, Transfigured, unicorn.\"",
      "Harry had checked the books, had learned that since he was too\nyoung to have sexual thoughts he would be able to approach a\nunicorn without fear. The same books had said nothing about\nunicorns being smart. Harry had already noticed that every\nintelligent magical species was at least partially humanoid, from\nmerfolk to centaurs to giants, from elves to goblins to veela. All\nhad essentially humanlike emotions, many were known to interbreed\nwith humans. Harry had already reasoned out that magic didn't\ncreate new intelligence but just changed the shape of genetically\nhuman beings. Unicorns were equinoid, were not even partially\nhumanoid, didn't talk, used no tools, they were almost certainly\njust magical horses. If it was right to eat a cow to feed yourself\nfor a day, then it had to be right to drink a unicorn's\nblood in order to stave off death for weeks. You couldn't have it\nboth ways.",
      "So Harry had gone into the Forbidden Forest wearing his Cloak.\nHe had searched the Grove of Unicorns until he saw her, a proud\ncreature with a pure white coat and violet hair, with three blue\nblotches on her flank. Harry had gone over, and the sapphire eyes\nhad stared at him inquisitively. Harry had tapped out the sequence\n1-2-3 on the ground several times with his shoes. The unicorn had\nshown no sign of responding in kind. Harry had reached over, taken\nher hoof in his hand, and tapped the same sequence with the\nunicorn's hoof. The unicorn had only looked at him curiously.",
      "And something about feeding the unicorn the\nsleeping-potion-laced sugar cubes had still felt like murder.",
      "That magic gives their existence a weight of meaning which\nno mere animal could possess... to slay something innocent to save\noneself, that is a very grave sin. Those two phrases, from\nProfessor McGonagall, from the centaur, had both run through\nHarry's mind, over and over as the white unicorn had yawned, laid\ndown on the ground, and closed its eyes for what would be the last\ntime. The Transfiguration had lasted an hour, and Harry's eyes had\nwatered repeatedly as he worked. The unicorn's death might not have\ncome then, but it would come soon enough, and it was foreign to\nHarry's nature to try to refuse responsibility of any kind. Harry\nwould just have to hope that, if you didn't kill the unicorn to\nsave yourself, if you did it to help a friend, it would be\nacceptable in the end.",
      "Professor Quirrell's eyebrows had climbed toward his hairline.\nHis voice was less soft, had something of his normal sharpness, as\nhe said, \"I forbid you from doing that again.\"",
      "\"I wondered if you'd say that,\" Harry said. He swallowed again.\n\"But this unicorn is already, already doomed, so you might as well\ntake it, Professor...\"",
      "\"Why have you done this?\"",
      "If the Defense Professor really didn't understand that, he was\nslower on the uptake than anyone Harry had ever met. \"I kept\nthinking there was nothing I could do,\" Harry said. \"I got tired of\nthinking it.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell closed his eyes. His head leaned back into\nthe pillow. \"You were lucky,\" the Defense Professor said in a soft\nvoice, \"that a unicorn in Transfigured form... did not set off the\nHogwarts wards, as a strange creature... I shall have to... take\nthis outside the grounds, to make use of it... but that can be\nmanaged. I shall tell them that I wish to look upon the lake... I\nwill ask you to sustain the Transfiguration before you go, and it\nshould last long enough, after that... and with my last strength,\ndispel whatever death-alarms were placed to watch over the herd...\nwhich, the unicorn being not yet dead, but only Transfigured, will\nnot yet have triggered... you were very lucky, Mr. Potter.\"",
      "Harry nodded. He started to speak, then stopped again. Words\nseemed to stick in his throat once more.",
      "You already calculated the expected utilities, if it works,\nif it goes wrong. You assigned probabilities, you multiplied, and\nthen you threw out the answer and went with your new gut feeling,\nwhich was the same. So say it.",
      "\"Do you know,\" Harry said unsteadily, \"of any way at all, by\nwhich your life might be saved?\"",
      "The Defense Professor's eyes opened. \"Why... do you ask me that,\nboy?\"",
      "\"There's... a spell I heard of, a ritual -\"",
      "\"Be silent,\" said the Defense Professor.",
      "An instant later a snake lay in the bed.",
      "Even the snake's eyes were dull.",
      "It did not rise.",
      "\"Sspeak on,\" hissed that snake, its flickering tongue\nits only motion.",
      "\"There is... there iss a ritual, I heard of from the\nsschoolmasster, by which he thinkss the Dark Lord might have lived\non. It iss called -\" and Harry stopped, as he realized that he\ndid know how to say the word in Parseltongue. \"Horcrux. It\nrequiress a death, I have heard. But if you are dying in any casse,\nyou might try to adapt the ritual, even at great rissk for the new\nsspell, sso that it can be done with a different ssacrifice. It\nwould change the whole world, if you ssucceed - though I don't know\nanything about the sspell - the sschoolmasster thought it tore off\na piece of ssoul, though I don't ssee how that could be true\n-\"",
      "The snake was hissing laughter, strange sharp laughter, almost\nhysterical. \"You tell me of that sspell? Me? You musst learn\nmore caution in the future, boy. But it matterss not. I learned of\nthe horcrux sspell ssince long ago. It iss meaninglesss.\"",
      "\"Meaningless?\" Harry said aloud in surprise.",
      "\"Would be pointlesss sspell from beginning, if ssoulss\nexissted. Tear piece of ssoul? That iss lie. Missdirection\nto hide true ssecret. Only one who doess not believe in common\nliess will reasson further, ssee beneath obsscuration, realisse how\nto casst sspell. Required murder iss not ssacrificial ritual at\nall. Ssudden death ssometimes makess ghosst, if magic burssts and\nimprintss on nearby thing. Horcrux sspell channelss death-bursst\nthrough casster, createss your own ghosst insstead of victim'ss,\nimprintss ghosst in sspecial device. Ssecond victim pickss up\nhorcrux device, device imprintss your memoriess into them. But only\nmemoriess from time horcrux device wass made. You ssee\nflaw?\"",
      "The burning sensation was back in Harry's throat. \"No\ncontinuity of -\" there wasn't a snake word for consciousness\n\"- sself, you would go on thinking after making the horcrux,\nthen sself with new memoriess diess and iss not resstored\n-\"",
      "\"Yess, you do ssee. Alsso Merlin'ss Interdict preventss\npowerful sspells from passing through ssuch a device, ssince it iss\nnot truly alive. Dark Wizardss who think to return thuss are\nweaker, eassily disspatched. None have perssissted long by ssuch\nmeanss. Perssonalitiess change, mix with victim'ss. Death iss not\ntruly gainssaid. Real sself is losst, as you ssay. Not to my\npressent tasste. Admit I conssidered it, long ago.\"",
      "A man was lying in the infirmary bed once more. The Defense\nProfessor breathed, then made a wretched coughing sound.",
      "\"Can you give me a full recipe for the spell?\" Harry said, after\na moment's deliberation. \"There might be some way to improve on the\nflaws, with enough research. Some way to do it ethically and have\nit work.\" Like doing the transfer into a clone body with a blank\nbrain, instead of an innocent victim, which might also improve the\nfidelity of the personality transfer... though that still left the\nother problems.",
      "Professor Quirrell made a short sound, under his breath, that\nmight have been laughter. \"You know, boy,\" Professor Quirrell\nwhispered, \"I had thought... to teach you everything... the seeds\nof all the secrets I knew... from one living mind to another... so\nthat later, when you found the right books, you would be able to\nunderstand... I would have passed on my knowledge to you, my\nheir... we would have begun as soon as you asked me... but you\nnever asked.\"",
      "Even the grief surrounding by Harry like thick water gave way to\nthat, to the sheer magnitude of the missed opportunity. \"I was\nsupposed to - ? I didn't know I was supposed to - !\"",
      "Another coughing chuckle. \"Ah yes... the unknowing Muggleborn...\nin heritage if not in blood... that is you. But I thought... better\nof it... that you should not walk my path... it was not a good\npath, in the end.\"",
      "\"It's not too late, Professor!\" Harry said. A part of Harry\nyelled that he was being selfish, and then another part shouted\nthat down; there would be other people to help.",
      "\"Yes, it is too late... and you shall not... persuade me\notherwise... I have... thought better of it... as I said... I am\ntoo full... of secrets better left unknown... look at\nme.\"",
      "Harry looked, almost despite himself.",
      "He saw a still-unwrinkled face, looking old and pained, beneath\na head rapidly losing its hair, even the sides looking wispy now;\nHarry saw a face he'd always thought was sharp, now revealed as\nthin, muscle and fat fading away from the face, as from\nthe arms beneath it, like the skeletal form of Bellatrix Black he'd\nseen in Azkaban -",
      "Harry's head wrenched aside, unthinkingly.",
      "\"You see,\" whispered the Professor. \"I dislike to sound\ncliched... Mr. Potter... but the truth is... the Arts called\nDark... really are not good for a person... in the end.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell breathed in, breathed out. There was quiet\nfor a time in the infirmary, the two of them watched only by the\nelaborately ornamented stone of the walls.",
      "\"Is there anything left... unsaid between us?\" said Professor\nQuirrell. \"I am not dying today... mind you... not right now... but\nI do not know how long... I shall be able to converse.\"",
      "\"There's,\" Harry said, swallowed again. \"There's a lot of\nthings, way too many things, but... it might be the wrong thing to\nask, but I don't want - this one question unanswered - snake?\"",
      "A snake lay on the bed.",
      "\"I learned how the Killing Cursse workss. Requiress true\nhate to casst, not much hate, but musst want target dead, they\nssay. In prisson with life-eaterss, you casst Killing Cursse at\nguard - ssaid you did not want him dead - wass that lie? Here, now,\nat thiss disstance - you may sspeak truth - even if you fear it\nreflectss poorly on you - it sshould not matter now, teacher. I\nwissh to know. Musst know. Will not abandon you, either\nway.\"",
      "A man lay on the bed.",
      "\"Listen carefully,\" Professor Quirrell whispered. \"I will tell\nyou a conundrum... a riddle of a dangerous spell... when you know\nthe answer to that puzzle... you will also know... the answer to\nyour question... are you listening?\"",
      "Harry nodded.",
      "\"There is a limitation... to the Killing Curse. To cast it\nonce... in a fight... you must hate enough... to want the other\ndead. To cast Avada... Kedavra twice... you must hate enough... to\nkill twice... to cut their throat with your own hands... to watch\nthem die... then do it again. Very few... can hate enough... to\nkill someone... five times... they would... get bored.\" The Defense\nProfessor breathed several times, before continuing. \"But if you\nlook at history... you will find some Dark Wizards... who could\ncast the Killing Curse... over and over. A nineteenth-century\nwitch... who called herself Dark Evangel... the Aurors called her\nA. K. McDowell. She could cast the Killing Curse... a dozen\ntimes... in one fight. Ask yourself... as I asked myself... what is\nthe secret... that she knew? What is deadlier than hate... and\nflows without limit?\"",
      "A second level to the Avada Kedavra spell, just like with\nthe Patronus Charm...",
      "\"I don't really care,\" Harry answered.",
      "The Defense Professor chuckled wetly. \"Good. You are...\nlearning. So you see...\" A pause of transformation. \"I did not\nwissh guard dead, after all. Casst Killing Cursse, but not with\nhate.\" And then a man.",
      "Harry swallowed hard. It was both better, and worse, than what\nHarry had suspected; and characteristic enough of Professor\nQuirrell. A cracked soul, for certain; but Professor Quirrell had\nnever claimed to be whole.",
      "\"Any else... to say?\" said the man in the bed.",
      "\"Are you absolutely sure,\" Harry said, \"that there is nothing\nyou've ever heard of that might save you, Professor? In all your\nlore? Finding and uniting all three Deathly Hallows, an ancient\nartifact that Merlin sealed behind a riddle nobody's ever figured\nout? You've seen some of what I can do. That I'm good at solving\nriddles. You know I can figure things out, sometimes, that other\nwizards can't. I -\" Harry's voice broke. \"I have a strong\npreference for your life, over your death, Professor Quirrell.\"",
      "There was a long pause.",
      "\"One thing,\" whispered Professor Quirrell. \"One thing... that\nmight do it... or it might not... but to obtain it... is beyond\nyour power, or mine...\"",
      "Oh, it was just the setup for a subquest, said Harry's\nInner Critic.",
      "All the other parts screamed for that part to shut up. Life\ndidn't work like that. Ancient artifacts could be found, but not in\na month, not when you couldn't leave Hogwarts and were still in\nyour first year.",
      "Professor Quirrell took in a deep breath. Exhaled. \"I'm sorry...\nthat came out... too dramatic. Do not... get your hopes up... Mr.\nPotter. You asked... for anything... no matter how unlikely. There\nis... a certain object... called...\"",
      "A snake lay on the bed.",
      "\"The Philossopher'ss Sstone,\" hissed the snake.",
      "If there'd been a mass-manufacturable means of safe immortality\nthis entire time and nobody had bothered, Harry was going to snap\nand kill everyone.",
      "\"I read of it in a book,\" Harry hissed. \"Concluded\nit wass obviouss myth. No reason why ssame device would provide\nimmortality and endlesss gold. Not unlesss ssomeone wass jusst\ninventing happy sstoriess. Not to mention, every ssane persson\nsshould have been ressearching wayss to make more Sstoness, or\nkidnapping maker to produce. Thought of you sspecifically,\nteacher.\"",
      "A hissing of cold laughter. \"Reassoning iss wisse, but not\nwisse enough. Like with horcrux sspell, abssurdity hidess true\nssecret. True Sstone iss not what that legend ssayss. True power\niss not what sstoriess claim. Sstone's ssuppossed maker wass not\none who made it. One who holdss it now, wass not born to name now\nussed. Yet Sstone iss powerful healing device in truth. Have you\nheard it sspoken of?\"",
      "\"Jusst in the book.\"",
      "\"One who holdss Sstone iss repossitory of much lore. Taught\nsschoolmasster many ssecretss. Sschoolmasster hass ssaid nothing of\nSstone'ss holder, nothing of Sstone? No hintss?\"",
      "\"Not that I can eassily recall,\" Harry replied\nhonestly.",
      "\"Ah,\" hissed the snake. \"Ah, well.\"",
      "\"Could assk sschoolmasster -\"",
      "\"No! Do not assk him, boy. He would not take quesstion\nwell.\"",
      "\"But if the Sstone only healss -\"",
      "\"Sschoolmasster doess not believe that, would not believe\nthat. Too many have ssought Sstone, or ssought holder's lore. Do\nnot assk. Musst not assk. Do not try to obtain Sstone yoursself. I\nforbid.\"",
      "A man lay on the bed once more. \"I am at... my limit...\" said\nProfessor Quirrell. \"I must regain... my strength... before I go...\nto the forest... with your gift. Leave now... but sustain the\nTransfiguration... before you go.\"",
      "Harry reached out, touched the white pebble lying within the\nkerchief, renewing the Transfiguration on it. \"It should last for\none hour and fifty-three minutes after this,\" Harry said.",
      "\"Your studies... do well.\"",
      "It was far longer than Harry's Transfigurations had lasted at\nthe start of the school year. Second-year spells came to him easily\nnow, without strain; which wasn't surprising, since he would be\ntwelve in less than two months. Harry could even have cast a Memory\nCharm, if it had been good for someone to forget every memory\ninvolving their left arm. He was climbing the power ladder, slowly,\nfrom very far down.",
      "The thought came with a potential for sadness, a thought of one\ndoor opening as another closed; which Harry also rejected.",
      "The door to the infirmary closed behind Harry, as the\nBoy-Who-Lived walked swiftly and with purpose, shrugging on his\nInvisibility Cloak as he moved. Soon, presumably, Professor\nQuirrell would call for assistance; and an older student trio would\nguide the Defense Professor into some quiet place, maybe the\nforest, with an excuse of viewing the lake or some such. Someplace\nthe Defense Professor could eat a unicorn undetected, after Harry's\nTransfiguration wore off.",
      "And then Professor Quirrell would be healthier, for a time. His\npower would return to him as strong as he'd ever been, for a much\nshorter time.",
      "It wouldn't last.",
      "Harry's fists clenched as he strode, the tension radiating up\nhis arm muscles. If the Defense Professor's treatment regimen\nhadn't been interrupted, by Harry and the Aurors that he\nhad brought to Hogwarts...",
      "It was stupid to blame himself, Harry knew it was stupid and\nsomehow his brain was doing it anyway. Like his brain was\nsearching, carefully finding and selecting some way for this to be\nhis fault, no matter how far it had to stretch.",
      "As if having things be his fault were the only way that his\nbrain knew how to grieve.",
      "A trio of seventh-year Slytherins passed Harry's invisible form\nin the hallway, heading for the healer's offices where the\nProfessor waited, looking deeply serious and concerned. Was that\nhow other people grieved?",
      "Or did they, on some level, not really care, as\nProfessor Quirrell thought?",
      "There is a second level to the Killing Curse.",
      "Harry's brain had solved the riddle instantly, in the moment of\nfirst hearing it; as though the knowledge had always been inside\nhim, waiting to make itself known.",
      "Harry had read once, somewhere, that the opposite of happiness\nwasn't sadness, but boredom; and the author had gone on to say that\nto find happiness in life you asked yourself not what would make\nyou happy, but what would excite you. And by the same reasoning,\nhatred wasn't the true opposite of love. Even hatred was a kind of\nrespect that you could give to someone's existence. If you cared\nabout someone enough to prefer their dying to their living, it\nmeant you were thinking about them.",
      "It had come up much earlier, before the Trial, in conversation\nwith Hermione; when she'd said something about magical Britain\nbeing Prejudiced, with considerable and recent justification. And\nHarry had thought - but not said - that at least she'd been let\ninto Hogwarts to be spat upon.",
      "Not like certain people living in certain countries, who were,\nit was said, as human as anyone else; who were\nsaid to be sapient beings, worth more than any mere\nunicorn. But who nonetheless wouldn't be allowed to live in Muggle\nBritain. On that score, at least, no Muggle had the right to look a\nwizard in the eye. Magical Britain might discriminate against\nMuggleborns, but at least it allowed them inside so they could be\nspat upon in person.",
      "What is deadlier than hate, and flows without\nlimit?",
      "\"Indifference,\" Harry whispered aloud, the secret of a spell he\nwould never be able to cast; and kept striding toward the library\nto read anything he could find, anything at all, about the\nPhilosopher's Stone."

      "June 4th, 1992.",
      "Daphne Greengrass was in the Slytherin common room, writing a\nletter to her Lady Mother (who was surprisingly intransigent about\npower-sharing, despite not even being in Hogwarts to\nexercise control) when she saw Draco Malfoy stagger in through the\nportrait door carrying what must have been a dozen books, Vincent\nand Gregory behind him each carrying a dozen more. The Auror who'd\naccompanied Malfoy stuck his head in briefly, then withdrew to\nwho-knew-where.",
      "Draco looked around, then seemed to be struck by a bright idea\nas he staggered toward her, Vincent and Gregory following\nafter.",
      "\"Can you help me read these?\" said Draco, sounding slightly out\nof breath as he approached.",
      "\"What.\" Lessons were over, only the exams were left\nnow, and since when did Malfoys ask Greengrasses\nfor help with their homework?",
      "\"These,\" Draco Malfoy said importantly, \"are all the library\nbooks Miss Granger borrowed between April 1st and April 16th. I\nthought I'd go through them in case there are any Clues there, only\nthen I thought, maybe you should help because you knew\nMiss Granger better.\"",
      "Daphne stared at the books. \"The General read all that in\ntwo weeks?\u202f\" A twinge of pain went through her heart, but\nshe suppressed it.",
      "\"Well, I don't know if Miss Granger finished them all,\" Draco\nsaid. He held up a cautioning finger. \"In fact, we don't know if\nshe read any of them, or if she really borrowed them, I mean, all\nwe've observed is that the library ledger says she checked\nthem out -\"",
      "Daphne suppressed a groan. Malfoy had been talking like this for\nweeks. There were some people who clearly were not meant to be\ninvolved with mysterious murders because it did strange things\nto their minds. \"Mr. Malfoy, I couldn't read all these if I\nspent my whole summer doing nothing else.\"",
      "\"Then just skim through them, please?\" Draco said. \"Especially\nif there's, you know, mysterious words scribbled in her\nhandwriting, or a bookmark left inside, or -\"",
      "\"I've seen those plays too, Mr. Malfoy.\" Daphne rolled her eyes.\n\"Don't we have Aurors now for -\"",
      "\"We're doomed!\u202f\" shrieked Millicent Bulstrode, as she\nburst up from the lower chambers into the Slytherin common\nroom.",
      "People paused to look at her.",
      "\"It's Professor Quirrell!\u202f\"",
      "A sudden air of attentiveness, as of long-standing disputes\nabout to be settled. \"Well, finally,\" someone said, as Millicent\ntried to catch her breath. \"He's only got, what, ten days left to\ngo bad?\"",
      "\"Eleven days,\" said the seventh-year who was running the betting\npool.",
      "\"He's gotten a little better suddenly and he's going to\nsummon the first-years for our Defense final! By surprise! In fifty\nminutes!\u202f\"",
      "\"A Defense final?\" Pansy said blankly. \"But Professor Quirrell\ndoesn't give exams.\"",
      "\"The Ministry Defense final!\" shrieked Millicent.",
      "\"But Professor Quirrell doesn't teach anything from the Ministry\ncurriculum,\" objected Pansy.",
      "Daphne was already fleeing to her room, racing for the\nfirst-year Defense textbook that she hadn't touched since September\nand screaming curses inside her mind.",
      "One desk back of her, someone was crying, their soft sobs\nproviding a background chant of despair for the classroom. Daphne\nlooked back, expecting to see a Hufflepuff and hoping it wasn't\nHannah, and was surprised at first (though not on further\nreflection) to see it was a Ravenclaw.",
      "Before them were set the exam parchments, turned over, waiting\nfor the bell.",
      "Fifty minutes hadn't been nearly enough preparation time, but it\nwas something, and Daphne was now feeling ashamed that she hadn't\nthought to send messengers to warn the Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and\nGryffindor Houses. They'd started giving House Points again just\nthree days ago, at the beginning of June, but the Auxiliary\nProtective Special Committee still ought to promote House\nunity.",
      "Another Ravenclaw, sitting four desks to her left, also started\nto cry. That was Katherine Tung of Dragon Army, if she recalled\ncorrectly, whom she'd once seen take on three Sunshine Soldiers\nsimultaneously without a flinch.",
      "Daphne had calmed down after the first couple of minutes of\nfrantic reading. It was just a test, not a murder or\nanything; and if almost all the first-year students turned in\nmostly blank parchments then it stood to reason that nobody would\nbe shamed. But Daphne could understand, if not exactly sympathize,\nthat Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs might not see it that way.",
      "\"He's evil,\" another Ravenclaw witch said in a shaking voice.\n\"One hundred percent pure Dark Wizard to the bone. The Dark Lord\nGrindelwald wouldn't do this, not to children, he's worse than\nYou-Know-Who.\"",
      "Daphne looked reflexively at where Professor Quirrell was\nsitting, slumped to one side but his eyes alert; and she thought\nshe saw the Defense Professor smile for one tiny instant. No, that\nhad to be her imagination, there was no way the Defense Professor\ncould have heard that.",
      "The bell rang.",
      "Daphne flipped the parchment over.",
      "The top was stamped with the seals for the Ministry, the\nHogwarts Board of Governors, and the Department of Magical\nEducation, and runes to detect cheating. Below that was a line for\nher to write her name, and a list of exam rules with a picture of\nLindsay Gagnon, the Director of the Department of Magical\nEducation, shaking an admonishing finger at everyone.",
      "Halfway down the page was the first exam question.",
      "It was, Why is it important for children to stay away from\nstrange creatures?",
      "There was a stunned pause.",
      "One student began laughing, she thought it was from the\nGryffindor section of the class. Professor Quirrell made no motion\nto censor it, and the laughter spread.",
      "Nobody spoke aloud, but the students looked around at each\nother, exchanging glances as the laughter died down, and then as if\nby some unspoken agreement they all looked at Professor Quirrell,\nwho was smiling down at them benevolently.",
      "Daphne bent over her exam, wearing a defiant evil smile that\nwould have done proud to either Godric Gryffindor or Grindelwald;\nand she wrote down, Because my Stunning Hex, my Most Ancient\nBlade, and my Patronus Charm won't work against\neverything.",
      "Harry Potter turned over the last page of his Defense exam.",
      "Even Harry had needed to quash a small bit of nervousness, some\ntiny remnant of his childhood, upon reading the first real question\n('How can you make a Shrieking Eel be silent?'). Professor\nQuirrell's lessons had spent roughly zero time on the surprising\nyet useless trivia that some idiot had imagined a 'Defense class'\nshould look like. In principle, Harry could have used his\nTime-Turner to read through the first-year Defense book after being\nnotified of the surprise exam; but that might have unfairly skewed\nthe grading curve for others. After staring at the question for a\ncouple of seconds, Harry had written down 'Quieting Charm', and\nincluded the casting directions in case the Ministry grader didn't\nbelieve that Harry knew it.",
      "Once Harry had decided to just answer all the questions\ncorrectly, the exam had gone by very quickly. The most\nrealistic answer to more than half the questions was 'Stunning\nHex', and many of the other questions had optimal solutions along\nthe lines of 'Turn around and walk in the opposite direction' or\n'Throw away the cheese and buy a new pair of shoes.'",
      "The last question on the test was \"What would you do if you\nsuspected there might be a Bogeysnake underneath your bed?\" The\nMinistry-approved answer, Harry could in fact recall from his\nread-through of the textbook at the start of the year, was Tell\nyour parents. The problem with this had occurred to Harry\nright away, which was why Harry had remembered it.",
      "After some pondering, Harry wrote down:",
      "Dear Ministry grader: I'm afraid the real answer to that is\na secret, but rest assured that a Bogeysnake would present no more\ntrouble to me than a mountain troll, a Dementor, or You-Know-Who.\nPlease inform your superiors that I find your standard answer\nprejudicial to Muggleborns, and that I expect this failing will be\ncorrected at once without any need for my direct\nintervention.",
      "Sincerely, the Boy-Who-Lived.",
      "Harry signed the last parchment with a broad flourish, turned it\nover into his stack, put down his quill, and sat up.",
      "Looking around, Harry saw that Professor Quirrell seemed to be\nlooking in his rough direction, though the Defense Professor's head\nhad nodded to one side. The other students were still writing. Some\nof them were silently crying, but they were still writing.\nContinuing to fight was also a lesson Professor Quirrell\nhad taught.",
      "Interminably later, the official exam time was up. A\nseventh-year student went from desk to desk, collecting the exams\nin Professor Quirrell's place.",
      "The last exam parchment was collected, and Professor Quirrell\nsat up straight.",
      "\"My young students,\" he said softly. The seventh-year student\nhad her wand trained on the Defense Professor's mouth, so that they\nall heard his voice seeming to come from right beside them. \"I\nknow... that probably seemed very fearsome to some of you... it is\na different kind of fear from facing the enemy's wand... you must\nconquer it separately. So I... shall tell you this now. It is the\ncustom of Hogwarts... that grades are given in the second week of\nJune. But for my case... they can make an exception, I think.\" The\nDefense Professor smiled his familiar dry smile, tinged now as\nthough by a suppressed grimace. \"I know you are worried... that you\nwere not prepared for this exam... that my lessons have not covered\nthis material... and I quite forgot to mention... that it was\napproaching... though you should have known... it would come in\ntime. But I have just now magically checked... the answers you have\ngiven on that... terribly, terribly important final exam... though\nof course only the Ministry grade is official... and assigned your\nfull-year grades taking the results into account... and magically\nwritten your full grades down on these parchments,\" Professor\nQuirrell tapped a stack of parchments on the side of his desk,\n\"which will now be handed out... an incredible spell... is it\nnot?\"",
      "A few students on the Ravenclaw side were looking indignant, but\nfor the most part the students just looked relieved, and some\nSlytherins were chuckling. Harry would have laughed too, if not for\nthe pain of watching Professor Quirrell gasp out the words.",
      "The seventh-year student standing beside Professor Quirrell\npointed her wand and spoke an incantation in magical pseudo-Latin.\nThe parchments rose up and started to drift through the air,\nseparating in mid-flow to drift toward each student.",
      "Harry waited until his parchment had arrived on his desk, and\nthen unfolded it.",
      "The parchment said EE+, which stood for Exceeds Expectations. It\nwas the second-highest grade letter, the highest being\nOutstanding.",
      "In another world, a distant vanished world, a little boy named\nHarry would have shouted with indignation about receiving only the\nsecond-highest grade. This Harry sat quietly and thought. Professor\nQuirrell was making some point, and it wasn't as though the exact\ngrade letter mattered in any other way. Was Professor Quirrell\nsaying that Harry had done relatively well, but not lived up to his\nfull potential? Or was the grade meant to be read literally, that\nHarry had in fact exceeded the Defense Professor's\nexpectations?",
      "\"All of you... pass,\" Professor Quirrell said, as the students\nall looked at their final grades, as sighs of relief rose from\ndesks and Lavender Brown raised her parchment in a clenched fist\nheld high with triumph. \"Every student in first-year Battle Magic\nhas passed... except for one.\"",
      "A number of students looked up in sudden terror.",
      "Harry sat there silently. He had seen the point immediately, and\neven if it was a wrong point, he knew Professor Quirrell would\nnever, ever be talked out of making it.",
      "\"All of you in this room... have received grades of at least\nAcceptable. Neville Longbottom... who took this test in the\nLongbottom home... received a grade of Outstanding. But the other\nstudent who is not here... has had a Dreadful grade entered on her\nrecord... for failing the only important test... that was given her\nthis year. I would have marked her even lower... but that would\nhave been in poor taste.\"",
      "The room was very quiet, though a number of students were\nstaring angrily at the Professor.",
      "\"You may think that a grade of Dreadful... is not fair. That\nMiss Granger was faced with a test... for which her lessons... had\nnot prepared her. That she was not told... that the exam was coming\non that day.\"",
      "The Defense Professor drew in a shaking breath.",
      "\"Such is realism,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"The only important\ntest... may come at any time... be better prepared for it... than\nshe was. As for the rest of you... those who have received Exceeds\nExpectations or above... have received my letters of\nrecommendation... to certain organizations beyond Britain's\nshores... where your training might be completed. They will contact\nyou... when you are old enough... if you still appear worthy... and\nif you have not failed an important test. And remember... from this\nday... you must train yourselves... you cannot rely... on future\nDefense professors. Your first year of Battle Magic is over... you\nare dismissed.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell sat back with his eyes closed, seeming to\nignore the excited babble that broke out around him.",
      "In time most of the students had departed, and one remained,\nstaying a prescribed distance from the Defense Professor.",
      "The Defense Professor opened his eyes.",
      "Harry raised the parchment with its EE+, still\nsilent.",
      "The Defense Professor smiled, and it went all the way to those\ntired eyes.",
      "\"It is the same grade... that I received in my own first\nyear.\"",
      "\"Th, th, th,\" Harry couldn't make the words thank you\ncome out, they were stuck in his suddenly closed throat, the\nDefense Professor tilting his head and giving him an inquiring\nstare, so Harry just bowed jerkily and then left the room."

      "June 13th, 1992.",
      "It was the last week of school in Hogwarts, and Professor\nQuirrell was still alive, barely. The Defense Professor himself\nwould be in a healer's bed, this day, as he'd been for almost the\nlast week.",
      "Hogwarts tradition said that exams were given in the first week\nof June, that exam results were released the second week, and that\nin the third week, there would be the Leave-Taking Feast on Sunday\nand the Hogwarts Express transporting you to London on Monday.",
      "Harry had wondered, a long time ago when he'd first read about\nthat schedule, just what exactly the students did during the\nrest of the second week of June, since 'waiting for exam\nresults' didn't sound like much; and the answer had surprised him\nwhen he'd found out.",
      "But now the second week of June was done as well, and it was\nSaturday; there was nothing left of the year but the Leave-Taking\nFeast on the 14th and the Hogwarts Express ride on the 15th.",
      "And nothing had been answered.",
      "Nothing had been resolved.",
      "Hermione's killer hadn't been found.",
      "Somehow Harry had been thinking that, surely, all the truth\nwould come out by the end of the school year; like that was the end\nof a mystery novel and the mystery's answer had been promised him.\nCertainly it had to be known by the time the Defense Professor...\ndied, it couldn't be allowed for Professor Quirrell to die\nwithout knowing the answer, without everything being neatly\nresolved. Not exam grades, certainly not death, it was only truth\nthat finished a story...",
      "But unless you bought Draco Malfoy's latest theory that\nProfessor Sprout had been assigning and grading less homework\naround the time of Hermione being framed for attempted murder,\nthereby proving that Professor Sprout had been spending her time\nsetting it up, the truth remained unfound.",
      "And instead, like the world had priorities that were more like\nother people's way of thinking, the year was going to end with a\nclimactic Quidditch match.",
      "In the air above the stadium, distant figures on broomsticks\nswooped and pirouetted and spun around each other. The red-purplish\ntruncated tetrahedron that was the Quaffle was caught, tossed,\nblocked, and occasionally thrown through floating hoops,\naccompanied by stadium-rocking cries of triumph or dismay. Blue and\ngreen and yellow and red-trimmed robes shouted with the enthusiasm\nthat people felt so easily when no action would be required from\nthem personally.",
      "It was the first Quidditch match Harry had attended at Hogwarts,\nand he'd already decided that it would be the last.",
      "\"Davies has the Quaffle!\" shouted the amplified voice of Lee\nJordan. \"That's another ten points for Ravenclaw in seven... six...\nfive... holy smokes, he's done it already! Smack through the center\nof the central hoop! I've never seen such a winning streak - I'm\ncalling it right now for Davies becoming Captain next year after\nBortan steps down -\"",
      "Lee's voice cut out abruptly and Professor McGonagall's own\namplified voice said, \"That's the Ravenclaw team's own business,\nMr. Jordan. Confine yourself to the match, please.\"",
      "\"And the Slytherins take possession - Flint hands off the\nQuaffle to the lovely -\"",
      "\"Mr. Jordan!\"",
      "\"To the merely acceptable Sharon Vizcaino, whose hair trails\nbehind her like a comet as she blazes toward the Ravenclaw defense\n- now with two Bludgers in close pursuit! Pucey's on Sharon's tail\n- what are you doing, Inglebee? - and she swerves in midair to\navoid - IS THAT THE SNITCH? GO, CHO CHANG, GO, HIGGS IS ALREADY -\nWHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING?\"",
      "\"Calm down, Mr. Jordan!\"",
      "\"HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO CALM DOWN? THAT WAS THE WORST MISSED PLAY\nI'VE EVER SEEN! And the Snitch is gone - maybe gone for good, after\nbeing missed that badly - Pucey's heading off towards the goal\nposts, Inglebee's nowhere near him -\"",
      "In a distant era of history, maybe in another world entirely,\nProfessor Quirrell had undertaken that the House Cup would be\nawarded to either Slytherin or Ravenclaw. Or possibly, somehow,\nboth; for he had promised that three wishes would be granted. So\nfar it was looking good on two out of three.",
      "If you just went by the current score, Hufflepuff was leading\nthe race for the House Cup by something like five hundred points,\nthanks to Hufflepuff's students doing their homework and\nstaying out of trouble. It appeared that Professor Snape\nhad been strategically taking quite a lot of points from\nHufflepuffs for, er, the last seven years or so. Slytherin House,\nreigning champion for the last seven years, still had to its\nadvantage a certain generosity of its Head of House in\nhanding out points; and this was sufficient to put it neck-and-neck\nwith Ravenclaw House, home of the academic achievers. Gryffindor\nwas far behind in the last place, as befit the House of\nnonconformists; Gryffindor had Slytherin's profile when it came to\nacademics and mischief, only without the advantage of Professor\nSnape. Even Fred and George had barely broken even on the year.",
      "Ravenclaw House and Slytherin House both needed a lot of points\nfrom somewhere if either wanted to catch up with\nHufflepuff in the next two days.",
      "And so far as anyone knew, Professor Quirrell hadn't done a\nsingle thing leading to the obvious result. It was happening all by\nitself, now that one lone Professor in Hogwarts had taught a class\nwith creative problem-solving.",
      "The final Quidditch match of the year was between Ravenclaw and\nSlytherin. Earlier in the year, Gryffindor's initial Quidditch lead\nhad vanished after their new Seeker, Emmett Shear, fell off a\npossibly malfunctioning broomstick during his second game. This had\nalso required some hasty rescheduling of the remaining games.",
      "This, the final game of the year, wouldn't end until the Snitch\nwas caught.",
      "Quidditch scores added directly onto the House points total.",
      "And what did you know, today it seemed that both the Slytherin\nand Ravenclaw Seekers just could... not... catch... the...\nSnitch.",
      "\"THE SNITCH WAS PRACTICALLY ON TOP OF YOU, YOU DIM-EYED\nDIMWIT!\"",
      "\"Language, Mr. Jordan, or I'll remove you from this game! Though\nit was a terrible play, I admit.\"",
      "Harry had to admit that Lee Jordan and Professor McGonagall had\na wonderful comedic routine, with Jordan as the banana-man and\nProfessor McGonagall as the straight-woman; Harry now felt a little\nsorry to have missed it at the earlier Quidditch matches. It was a\nside of Professor McGonagall he hadn't seen before.",
      "A few seats down from where Harry sat in the Hufflepuff section\nof the Quidditch bleachers, there lurked the hulking form of Cedric\nDiggory. The Super Hufflepuff had observed the most recent\nnear-air-collision between Cho Chang and Terence Higgs with the\nkeen eye of a wizard who was a Seeker and a Quidditch Captain in\nhis own right.",
      "\"The Ravenclaw Seeker is new,\" Cedric said. \"But Higgs is in his\nseventh year. I've played against him. He's better than that.\"",
      "\"You think it's a strategy?\" asked one of the Hufflepuffs\nsitting next to Cedric.",
      "\"It would make sense if Slytherin needed some extra points to\nlead for the Quidditch Cup,\" Cedric said. \"But Slytherin already\nhas us beat for the title. What are they thinking? They could've\nwon right there!\"",
      "The game had started at six o' clock in the afternoon. A typical\ngame would have gone until seven or so, at which point it would\nhave been time for dinner. June in Scotland meant plenty of\ndaylight; sunset wasn't until ten.",
      "It was at eight pm and six minutes, according to Harry's watch,\nwhen Slytherin had just scored another 10 points bringing the score\nto 170-140, when Cedric Diggory leapt out of his seat and shouted\n\"Those bastards!\"",
      "\"Yeah!\" cried a young boy beside him, leaping to his own feet.\n\"Who do they think they are, scoring points?\"",
      "\"Not that!\" cried Cedric Diggory. \"They're - they're trying to\nsteal the Cup from us!\u202f\"",
      "\"But we're not in the running any more for -\"",
      "\"Not the Quidditch Cup! The House Cup!\"",
      "The word spread, with cries of outrage.",
      "That was Harry's cue.",
      "Harry politely asked a Hufflepuff witch sitting next to him, and\nanother Hufflepuff sitting one row above him, if they could move\naside. Then Harry drew forth from his pouch a huge scroll, and\nunfurled it into a 2-meter-tall banner which stuck in place in\nmidair. The enchantment had been done courtesy of a sixth-year\nRavenclaw who had a reputation for knowing less about Quidditch\nthan Harry did.",
      "In huge, glowing purple letters, the sign read:",
      "JUST BUY A CLOCK",
      "2 : 06 : 47",
      "Beneath it was a Snitch, with a blinking red X over it.",
      "Second, after second, after second, the time counter\nincremented.",
      "As that counter rose higher, there seemed to be an awful lot of\nHufflepuffs who'd decided that they wanted to sit next to Harry's\nbanner.",
      "As the game dragged on past nine, there also seemed to be a lot\nof Gryffindors.",
      "As the sun set and Harry started using Lumos to read his books -\nhe'd given up on the actual game a long time ago - there were a\nnoticeable number of Ravenclaws who'd betrayed patriotism for\nsanity.",
      "And Professor Sinistra.",
      "And Professor Vector.",
      "And as the stars began to come out, Professor Flitwick.",
      "The climactic final Quidditch game of the year... dragged\non.",
      "One of the things Harry hadn't planned on, when he'd decided to\ndo this, was that he would still be out here at - Harry glanced at\nhis watch - eleven-oh-four at night. Harry was now reading a\nsixth-year Transfiguration textbook; or rather he'd weighted the\nbook open, illuminated by a Muggle glowstick, while he did one of\nthe exercises. Last week, when the graduating Ravenclaws were\ndiscussing their N.E.W.T. scores, Harry had overheard that\nupper-year Transfiguration practice involved several 'shaping\nexercises' that relied more on control and precise thinking than\nraw power; and Harry had promptly set out to learn those, whacking\nhimself hard on the forehead for not trying to read all\nthe later-year textbooks earlier. Professor McGonagall had approved\nHarry doing a shaping exercise that involved controlling the way in\nwhich a Transfiguring object approached its final form - for\nexample, Transfiguring a quill so that the shaft grew out first,\nthen the barbs. Harry was doing an analogous exercise with pencils,\ngrowing out the lead first, then surrounding it with wood and\nfinally having the eraser form on top. As Harry had suspected,\nfocusing his attention and magic into a particular part of the\npencil's ongoing transformation had proven similar to the mental\ndiscipline used in partial Transfiguration - which could indeed\nhave been used to fake the same effect, by partially Transfiguring\nonly the outer layers of the object. This way was proving\nrelatively easier, though.",
      "Harry finished his current pencil and looked up at the Quidditch\ngame, which was, check, still fantastically boring. Lee Jordan was\ncommentating in a tone of dull disgust, \"Another ten points - yay -\nwhoopee - and now someone takes possession of the Quaffle again -\nask if I care who.\"",
      "Almost nobody remaining in the stands was paying attention\neither, since everyone who'd remained in the stadium seemed to have\ndiscovered a new and more interesting sport, the debate about how\nto amend the House Cup rules and/or Quidditch. The argument had\nbecome heated to the point where all of the nearby Professors were\nbarely keeping order at a level short of open combat. This\nargument, unfortunately, had considerably more than two factions.\nSome darned busybodies were proposing sensible-sounding\nalternatives to eliminating the Snitch entirely, and this was\nthreatening to split the vote and sap the momentum for reform.",
      "In retrospect, Harry thought, it would have been nice to have\nDraco unfurl his own banner from the Slytherin side saying\n'SNITCHES ARE AWESOME', to set the polarity of the debate. Harry\nhad squinted over at the Slytherin section earlier, but he hadn't\nbeen able to spot Draco anywhere in the stands. Severus Snape, who\ncould also have been sympathetic enough to play the villainous\nopposition, was likewise nowhere to be seen.",
      "\"Mr. Potter?\" said a voice next to him.",
      "Beside Harry's seat was standing a short but older Hufflepuff\nboy, someone who'd never before come to Harry's attention, holding\nout a blank parchment envelope with wax dripped on the front. The\nwax was also blank, without impression.",
      "\"What is it?\" said Harry.",
      "\"It's me,\" said the boy. \"With the envelope you gave\nme. I know you said not to talk to you, but -\"",
      "\"Then don't talk to me,\" Harry said.",
      "The boy tossed the envelope at Harry and walked away, looking\noffended. It made Harry wince a little, but it probably hadn't been\nthe wrong decision considering the temporal issues...",
      "Then Harry broke the unsigned wax seal and drew out the\nenvelope's contents. It was parchment instead of the Muggle paper\nthat Harry would have expected, but the writing on it was his own\nhandwriting, if done with a quill instead of a pen. The parchment\nsaid:",
      "Beware the constellation,\nand help the watcher of stars.",
      "Pass unseen by the life-eaters'\nconfederates,\nand by the wise and the well-meaning.",
      "Six, and seven in a square,\nin the place that is prohibited and bloody stupid.",
      "Harry took it in at a glance, then folded the paper again and\nput it back into his cloak with another exhaled sigh. 'Beware the\nconstellation', really? Harry would have expected a riddle left by\nhimself, to himself, to have been easier to interpret... though\nsome parts were obvious enough. Clearly future-Harry had been\nworried about this paper being intercepted, and while present-Harry\nwouldn't ordinarily have thought of the local Aurors as 'the ones\nin league with the Dementors of Azkaban', maybe that had been the\nbest way to say 'Auror' without potentially tipping off anyone else\nwho read the parchment and did their own best to decrypt it.\nTranslating the idiom back out of the Parseltongue he'd used during\nthe Incident with Azkaban... that worked, Harry supposed.",
      "The note had said that Professor Quirrell needed help, and that\nwhatever was going on needed to pass unnoticed from the Aurors, and\nfrom Dumbledore and McGonagall and Flitwick. Since Time-Turning was\ninvolved already, the obvious solution was to leave for the loo,\ntravel back in time, and return to the game right after he'd\nleft.",
      "Harry started to rise from his seat, then hesitated. His\nHufflepuff side was remarking something about leaving the Auror\nescorts behind and not telling Professor McGonagall anything, and\nwondering if his future self was being stupid.",
      "Harry unfolded the parchment again, and took another glance at\nthe contents.",
      "On closer examination, the riddle-verse didn't say that Harry\ncouldn't bring anyone along. Draco Malfoy... was he\nmissing from the Quidditch game because future-Harry, hours in the\npast, had brought Draco with him as backup? But that didn't make\nsense, there wasn't much marginal improvement in safety from\nbringing along another first-year...",
      "...Draco Malfoy would certainly have been present, regardless of\nhis personal feelings about Quidditch, to watch Slytherin clinch\nthe House Cup. Had something happened to him?",
      "Suddenly Harry didn't feel as tired anymore.",
      "A trickle of adrenaline was starting to rise in Harry, but no,\nthis wouldn't be like the troll. The message had told\nHarry when to arrive. Harry wouldn't be too late, not this\ntime.",
      "Harry glanced over at where Cedric Diggory was looking back and\nforth, visibly torn between a clutch of Ravenclaws arguing that the\nSnitch had to be kept because it was traditional and rules were\nrules, and a pack of Hufflepuffs saying that it wasn't fair for the\nSeeker to be more important than the other players.",
      "Cedric Diggory had been an excellent dueling tutor to Harry and\nNeville, and Harry had thought they'd established a good\nrelationship. More importantly, a student taking literally all of\nthe electives would have his own Time-Turner. Maybe Harry could try\nto get Cedric to go back in time with him? The Super Hufflepuff\nseemed like a good spare wand to have by your side in any sort of\nsticky situation...",
      "Later, and earlier:",
      "Harry's watch now said 11:45, which translated into 6:45pm after\nlooping back five hours.",
      "\"It's time,\" Harry murmured to the empty air, and began walking\ndown the third-floor corridor above the grand staircase, on the\nright-hand side.",
      "'The place that is prohibited' would ordinarily mean the\nForbidden Forest; that was probably what someone intercepting the\nmessage was meant to think. But the Forbidden Forest was huge, and\nthere was more than one distinguished location inside it. No\nobvious Schelling Point at which to rendezvous, or find some event\nthat needed intervention.",
      "But when you added the 'bloody stupid' modifier, there was only\none prohibited place in Hogwarts that fit.",
      "And so Harry set forth on that outlawed path where, if rumor\nspoke true, all the first-year Gryffindors had gone before. The\nthird-floor corridor, on the right-hand side. A mysterious door\nleading to a series of rooms filled with dangerous and potentially\nlethal traps that nobody could possibly get through, especially if\nthey were only in their first year.",
      "Harry didn't know himself what sort of traps awaited. Which, on\nreflection, meant that the students who'd gone through had been\nsurprisingly scrupulous about not ruining the puzzle for others.\nMaybe there was a sign down there saying Don't give it away,\njust as a favor to me, sincerely Headmaster Dumbledore. All\nHarry knew so far was that the outer door would open to\nAlohomora, and that the final room contained a magic\nmirror that would show your reflection in some situation you found\nhighly appealing, which was apparently the big payoff.",
      "The third-floor corridor was illuminated by dim blue light that\nseemed to come from nowhere, and the arches were covered with\ncobwebs, as though the corridor hadn't been used in centuries\nrather than just the last year.",
      "Harry's pouch was loaded with useful Muggle things, and useful\nwizarding things, and everything he'd found that could possibly be\na quest item. (Harry had asked Professor McGonagall to recommend\nsomeone who could expand the pouch's capacity, and she'd just done\nit herself.) Harry had applied the Charm he'd learned for battles\nthat made his eyeglasses stick to his face, regardless of how his\nhead moved. Harry had refreshed the Transfigurations he was\nmaintaining, both the tiny jewel in the ring on his hand and the\nother one, in case he was knocked unconscious. He wasn't literally\nready for anything, but Harry was as ready as he thought he could\nbe.",
      "The five-sided floor tiles creaked beneath Harry's shoes and\nvanished behind him like the future becoming the past. It was\nalmost 6:49-six, and seven in a square. Obvious if you\nthought in Muggle math, otherwise not so much.",
      "Just as Harry was about to round another corner, something\ntickled at the back of his mind, and he heard a soft voice\ntalking.",
      "\"...sensible person... wait until later... after certain faculty\nhad departed...\"",
      "Harry stopped, then crept forward as lightly as he could, not\ngoing around the corner, trying to hear Professor Quirrell's voice\nbetter.",
      "There came a louder cough, and then the soft voice spoke again\nfrom around the corner. \"But if they were also... to depart\nthemselves... at that time...\" murmured the voice, \"they might\nthink... this final game... makes for the best distraction... left\nin this year... a predictable distraction. So I looked... to see\nwhat people of significance... were not at the game... and I saw\nthe Headmaster missing... but for all my magic can tell me... he\ncould be in another... realm of existence... I also saw your own\nabsence... so I decided to go... where you were. That is what I am\ndoing here... now... what are you doing here?\"",
      "Harry breathed shallowly, and listened.",
      "\"And just how did you know where I was?\" drawled the voice of\nSeverus Snape, so much louder that Harry nearly jumped.",
      "A small, coughing laugh. \"Check your wand... for Trace.\"",
      "Severus said something in magical pseudo-Latin, and then, \"You\ndared tamper with my wand? You dared?\u202f\"",
      "\"You are a suspect... just like myself... so your false\nindignation is wasted... however finely crafted it may be... now\ntell me... what are you doing?\"",
      "\"I am watching this door,\" said the voice of Professor Snape.\n\"And I will ask you to be off from it!\"",
      "\"On whose authority... are you ordering me... my fellow\nProfessor?\"",
      "There was a pause, then, \"Why, the Headmaster's,\" came the\nsmooth voice of Severus Snape. \"I was ordered by him to watch this\ndoor during the Quidditch match, and as a Professor I must obey his\nwhims. I shall have words about it with the Board of Governors\nlater, but for now I am doing as I must. Now be off with you, as\nthe Headmaster desires.\"",
      "\"What? You mean I am to believe... that you abandoned your\nSlytherins... during their most important... game of the year...\nand leapt up like a dog... at Dumbledore's word? Well that... I\nmust say... is entirely plausible. Even so... I think it would be\nwise... if I kept my own watch over you.. while you watch this fine\ndoor.\" There was a sound of rustling cloth and a soft thud, as if\nsomeone had sat down hard upon the ground, or maybe just\nfallen.",
      "\"Oh, for the love of Merlin -\" Severus Snape's voice now sounded\nangry. \"Get up, you!\"",
      "\"Ba-blu-a-bu-bluh -\" said the Defense Professor's\nzombie-mode.",
      "\"Get up!\" said Severus Snape, and there was a soft thud.",
      "Help the watcher of stars -",
      "Harry stepped around the corner, though it was possible that\nhe'd have done so even without an intertemporal message. Had\nProfessor Snape just kicked Professor Quirrell? That would\nhave been foolhardy if Professor Quirrell had been dead and\nburied.",
      "A round-topped door of dark wood was framed within a stone arch,\nset within the dusty marble bricks of Hogwarts. Where a Muggle\nwould have set a doorknob there was only a handle of polished\nmetal; there were no visible locks, or visible keyholes. Set upon\nthe wall to either side, a pair of torches burned, sending forth an\nominous orange glow. Before the door stood the Potions Master in\nhis customary stained robes. Beside the door, to the left side\nbeneath the orange torch, slumped the form of the Defense\nProfessor, back against the wall, head staring out at the\nsurroundings. The eyes seemed to flicker, as if halfway between\nawareness, and emptiness.",
      "\"What,\" said the towering form of the Potions Master,\n\"are you doing here, Potter?\u202f\"",
      "Going by facial expressions and tone of voice, the Potions\nMaster was quite angry with Harry; and certainly was not Harry's\nco-conspirator in councils to which the Defense Professor had never\nbeen invited.",
      "\"I'm not sure,\" Harry said. He wasn't sure what role he should\nbe playing, and was, in desperation, falling back on simple\nhonesty. \"I think perhaps I'm supposed to be keeping an eye on the\nDefense Professor.\"",
      "The Potions Master stared at him coldly. \"Where's your\nescort, Potter? Students are not to wander these halls\nalone!\"",
      "Harry's mind was genuinely blank. The game was afoot, and nobody\nhad told him the rules. \"I'm not sure how to answer that...\"",
      "The cold expression on Professor Snape's face flickered.\n\"Perhaps I should call the Aurors,\" he said.",
      "\"Wait!\" Harry blurted.",
      "The Potions Master's hand hovered about his robes. \"Why?\" said\nthe Potions Master.",
      "\"I... I just think you probably shouldn't call them...\"",
      "In a blur, the Potions Master's wand was in his hand.\n\"Nullus confundio!\" A black jet darted out and hit Harry,\nstriking in the direction Harry had already started to evade. There\nfollowed four other spells, containing words like\nPolyfluis and Metamorphus; and for those Harry\npolitely stood still.",
      "After all of those spells had failed to produce any effect,\nSeverus Snape was staring at Harry with a dark glitter that now\nseemed genuine. \"I suggest,\" the Potions Master said softly, \"that\nyou explain yourself, Potter.\"",
      "\"I can't explain myself,\" Harry said. \"I don't have the Time,\nnot yet.\"",
      "Harry looked directly into the Potions Master's gaze as he said\nthe words myself and time, widening his own eyes\nto try to convey the key information, and the Potions Master\nhesitated.",
      "Harry was frantically trying to work out who was pretending to\nbe what. Since Professor Quirrell wasn't in on Dumbledore's\nconspiracy, Severus was pretending to be the evil Potions Master of\nHogwarts, who'd been sent here by the Headmaster... and might or\nmight not have actually been sent here by Dumbledore... but\nProfessor Quirrell either thought, or was pretending to think, that\nsomeone needed to keep an eye on Professor Snape... and Harry\nhimself had been sent here by future-Harry and had no idea why...\nand why were they all standing outside the Headmaster's forbidden\ndoor in the first place?",
      "And then...",
      "From behind where Harry stood...",
      "Came the growing sound of another set of footsteps, rapid and\nmanyfold.",
      "Professor Snape stabbed his wand once, creating a burst of\ndarkness that shrouded where the Defense Professor was lying.\n\"Muffliato,\" the Potions Master hissed. \"Mr. Potter, if\nyou must be here, then hide! Put on your invisibility cloak! My\nduty is to guard this door in case he comes here. And\nthere has been - a disturbance, meant to draw the\nHeadmaster, he thinks -\"",
      "\"Who -\"",
      "Severus took a long stride forward and snapped his wand against\nthe side of Harry's head. There was a trickling sensation like an\negg had been cracked over him, the feeling of a Disillusionment\nCharm; and Harry's hands faded out, followed by the rest of\nhim.",
      "The darkness shrouding one side of the wall dissipated like slow\nmist, and there was again visible the huddled form of the Defense\nProfessor, who said nothing.",
      "Harry tiptoed away quietly as he could, then turned to\nwatch.",
      "The approaching footsteps rounded the corner -",
      "\"What are you doing here?\" came many simultaneous cries.",
      "Trimmed in three sets of Slytherin green and one Hufflepuff\nyellow stood Theodore Nott, Daphne Greengrass, Susan Bones, and\nTracey Davis.",
      "\"Where,\" said Professor Snape with mounting wrath, \"are\nyour escorts, children? First-years must be accompanied by\na sixth or seventh-year student at all times! Especially you!\"",
      "Theodore Nott raised his hand. \"We're, um,\" said Theodore Nott.\n\"We're doing what the Chaos Legion calls a team-building\nexercise... see, we realized just now that none of us had tried the\nHeadmaster's forbidden chamber yet, and there wasn't much time\nleft... and Harry Potter has authorized it, Professor, he said\nspecifically that you mustn't interfere.\"",
      "Severus Snape turned to glance over at where Harry Potter had\ntiptoed; a storm seemed to be gathering on his brow, and a dark\nfury in his eyes.",
      "I... maybe? There was still one hour left on Harry's\nTime-Turner, so it was possible.",
      "\"Harry Potter does not have that authority,\" the Potions Master\nsaid in a deceptively mild tone. \"Explain yourselves, now.\"",
      "\"Really?\" said the form of Susan Bones. \"Really? You're telling\nProfessor Snape that Harry Potter authorized the mission, that's\nyour idea of a bluff?\" The young Hufflepuff turned to Professor\nSnape and spoke, her voice strangely firm. \"Professor, this is the\ntruth and it's urgent. Draco Malfoy is missing and we think he went\ndown there -\"",
      "\"If Mr. Malfoy is missing,\" said Professor Snape, \"why have\nthe Aurors not been notified?\u202f\"",
      "\"Because of, because of reasons!\u202f\" cried Daphne\nGreengrass. \"There's no time, you've got to let us through!\"",
      "Professor Snape's voice was now as sardonic as Harry had ever\nheard it. \"Are you four morons under the impression that you are on\nsome sort of adventure? Well, you are mistaken. I assure you that\nMr. Malfoy has not passed through this door.\"",
      "\"We think Mr. Malfoy has an invisibility cloak,\" Susan Bones\nsaid rapidly. \"Do you remember the door seeming to open for no\nreason?\"",
      "\"No,\" the Potions Master said. \"Now be gone from here. This\nplace is off-limits for today.\"",
      "\"This is Dumbledore's forbidden corridor,\" Tracey said.\n\"The Headmaster himself said nobody was to come here. Who do you\nthink you are, forbidding it too?\"",
      "\"Miss Davis,\" said the Potions Master, \"you need to stop\nassociating with Gryffindors, especially those named Lavender\nBrown. And if you are still here in one minute, I will file papers\nrequesting your transfer into that House.\"",
      "\"You wouldn't dare!\u202f\" shrieked Tracey.",
      "\"Hm,\" Susan Bones said, her face screwed up in concentration.\n\"Professor Snape, do you occasionally open the door yourself, to\ncheck on whatever's inside?\"",
      "Professor Snape froze in place. Then he spun and put his right\nhand on the metal knocker -",
      "Harry was watching the hand on the knocker, so he didn't notice\nwhat Professor Snape was doing with his left hand until he heard\nthe sudden outcry.",
      "\"No, in fact,\" said Professor Snape, now holding the choking\nhead of Draco Malfoy by his collar, though the rest of Draco was\nstill underneath his invisibility cloak. \"A fine try, though.\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" cried Tracey and Daphne.",
      "Susan Bones hit herself in the forehead. \"I can't\nbelieve I fell for that.\"",
      "\"So, Mr. Malfoy,\" Professor Snape said. His voice had lowered.\n\"You sent your friends here on a ruse... just in the hopes that you\ncould pass through this door? Now why would you do that?\"",
      "\"I think we should trust him -\" said Theodore Nott. \"Mr. Malfoy,\nwe've got to trust him, he's the one Professor who would\ntake our side!\"",
      "\"No!\" cried Draco's floating head, from where Professor Snape\nwas still grasping his collar. \"You mustn't say anything!\nStop!\"",
      "\"We've got to take the chance!\" yelled Theodore. \"Professor\nSnape, Mr. Malfoy finally worked out what's been going on this\nwhole year, and why - Dumbledore is trying to get the Philosopher's\nStone away from Nicholas Flamel! Because Dumbledore doesn't think\nanyone ought to have immortality! So Dumbledore tried to convince\nFlamel that the Dark Lord was coming back and needed the Stone to\nrevive, and asked Flamel to give it to him, but Flamel wouldn't,\nand instead Flamel put the Stone in the magic mirror that's down\nthere, and Dumbledore is finding out right now how to get it, and\nthen he'll come for it and we've got to get to it first! Dumbledore\nreally will be all-powerful if he gets the Philosopher's\nStone!\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" said Tracey. \"That's not what you said\nbefore!\"",
      "\"It -\" Daphne said. She looked frightened, but determined. \"It\ndoesn't matter - Professor Snape, please, you have to\nbelieve me. I looked at the books Hermione checked out of the\nlibrary, and she was researching the Philosopher's Stone just\nbefore someone killed her. Her notes said that something dangerous\nmight happen if the Stone stays inside the mirror too long. We have\nto get it out of the castle right away.\"",
      "Susan Bones now had both hands over her face. \"I'm not with\nthem, I just came along to prevent anything even stupider from\nhappening.\"",
      "Severus Snape was staring at Theodore Nott and the others. Then\nhe turned his head to look at Draco Malfoy. \"Mr. Malfoy,\" the\nPotions Master drawled. \"How did you come to discover Dumbledore's\nplot?\"",
      "\"I deduced it from evidence!\" said Draco Malfoy's floating\nhead.",
      "Professor Snape's head swiveled back to Theodore Nott. \"How did\nyou intend to obtain this Stone from inside a magic mirror that\ncould supposedly baffle Dumbledore himself? Answer me at once!\"",
      "\"We're going to take the whole mirror and send it back to\nFlamel,\" said Theodore Nott. \"It's not like we want the Stone for\nourselves, we just need to stop Dumbledore from stealing it.\"",
      "Professor Snape nodded, as though confirming something, and\nturned his head to look at the other students. \"Tell me, have any\nof you noticed one of the others behaving in an unusual fashion?\nEspecially if there is a peculiar object that they have in their\npossession, or they can use spells a first-year should not know?\"\nProfessor Snape's right hand now pointed his wand at Susan Bones.\n\"I see that Miss Greengrass and Miss Davis are trying not to look\nat you, Miss Bones. If there is a mundane explanation, you would be\nwise to offer it immediately.\"",
      "Susan Bones's hair turned bright red, though her face didn't\nchange. \"I suppose there's not much point keeping it mum any\nlonger,\" she said, \"since I'm graduating in two days anyway.\"",
      "\"Double witches get to graduate six years early?\" said\nTracey Davis. \"That's not fair!\"",
      "\"Bones is a double witch?\" cried Theodore.",
      "\"No, she is Nymphadora Tonks, a Metamorphmagus,\" Professor Snape\nsaid. \"Masquerading as another student is extremely against\nregulation, as you are well aware, Miss Tonks. It is not too late\nto expel you from Hogwarts two days before your graduation, which\nwould be a dreadful tragedy - from your perspective, that is. From\nmy perspective it would be hilarious. Now tell me what exactly you\nare doing here.\"",
      "\"That explains it,\" said Daphne Greengrass. \"Um, is there\nactually a Susan Bones, or is the House dying out so they\nhad you secretly -\"",
      "The red-haired form of Susan Bones had a palm to her face. \"Yes,\nMiss Greengrass, there's a real Susan Bones. She only sends me in\nwhen you lot are about to get into ridiculous amounts of\ntrouble. Professor Snape, the reason I'm here is because Draco\nMalfoy was missing, and this lot insisted on trying to\nfind him instead of calling the Aurors. For reasons the real Miss\nBones said there was no time to explain to me, which I now realize\nwere stupid. But young students must never go alone, and must be\naccompanied by a sixth or seventh year at all times. And now we\nfound Draco Malfoy and we can all go back. Please? Before this gets\nany more ridiculous?\"",
      "\"What in Merlin's name is going on here?\"",
      "\"Ah,\" said Professor Snape, who was still pointing the wand at\nthe red-haired form of Susan Bones, his other hand still grasping\nthe collar below the disembodied head of Draco Malfoy, standing\nnext to the crumpled form of the Defense Professor. \"Professor\nSprout, I perceive.\"",
      "\"It's not what it looks like,\" volunteered Tracey Davis.",
      "The short, dumpy form of the Herbology Professor stormed\nforwards. She had, by this point, drawn her wand, though she wasn't\npointing it at anyone. \"I don't even know what this looks\nlike! Down wands, all of you, right now! Including\nyou, Professor!\"",
      "Distraction. The thought came to Harry with sudden\nclarity. Whatever he was watching now, from where he stood\ninvisibly and well back of the action, it wasn't what was\nreally going on, it wasn't the true thread of the story, it\nhad been arranged. Professor Sprout's arrival had broken\nHarry's suspension of disbelief; things like that didn't happen\njust for the sake of comedic coincidence. Someone was deliberately\ncausing all this chaos, but what was the point?",
      "Harry really hoped he hadn't gone back in time and done this,\nbecause it did seem like the sort of thing he would do.",
      "Severus Snape lowered his wand. His other hand unfisted Draco\nMalfoy. \"Professor Sprout,\" the Potions Master said, \"I am here on\nthe Headmaster's orders to watch this door. Everyone else present\nis not supposed to be here, and I ask you to see them\ncleared away.\"",
      "\"A likely story,\" snapped Professor Sprout. \"Why would\nDumbledore set you of all people to guard the door to his\nplayground? It's not as if he wants to keep the students out, oh\nno, they need to go in and get stuck in my Devil's Snare!\nSusan, dear, you've got a communications mirror, don't you? Use it\nto call the Aurors.\"",
      "The watching Harry nodded to himself. That was the\npoint. The Aurors would take away everyone present at this terribly\nconfusing situation, no excuses accepted, and then the door would\nbe unguarded.",
      "But was Harry meant to go into the forbidden corridor himself?\nOr watch, to see who finally came once all the others were\ngone?",
      "A loud fit of hacking and coughing caused everyone to look at\nwhere the Defense Professor lay.",
      "\"Snape - listen -\" said the Defense Professor between coughs.\n\"Why - Sprout - here -\"",
      "The Potions Master looked down.",
      "\"Memory Charm - implies - Professor -\" The Defense Professor\nbegan coughing again.",
      "\"What?\u202f\"",
      "And the logic unfolded in Harry's mind in crystalline dismay,\nall the steps already suspected, the dreadful realization coming as\na repetition with greater confidence.",
      "Someone had Memory-Charmed Hermione to believe she'd tried to\nkill Draco.",
      "Only a Hogwarts Professor could have done it without alarm.",
      "So all the true mastermind needed to do was Legilimise or\nImperius a Hogwarts Professor.",
      "And the last person anyone would suspect would be the Head of\nHouse Hufflepuff.",
      "Snape's head snapped around, as Professor Sprout raised her\nwand, and the Potions Master managed to raise a wordless\ntranslucent ward between them. But the bolt that shot from\nProfessor Sprout's wand was a dark brown that produced a surge of\nawful apprehension in Harry's mind; and the brown bolt made\nSeverus's shield wink out before they touched, clipping the Potions\nMaster's right arm even as he dodged. Professor Snape gave a\nmuffled shriek and his hand spasmed, dropping his wand.",
      "The next bolt that came from Sprout's wand was a bright red the\ncolor of a Stunning Hex, seeming to grow brighter and move faster\neven as it left her wand, accompanied by another surge of anxiety;\nand that blew the Potions Master into the door, dropping him\nmotionless to the ground.",
      "By that time pink-haired-Susan-Bones was surrounded by a\nmultifaceted blue haze and she was firing hex after hex at\nProfessor Sprout. Professor Sprout was ignoring the hexes to summon\nplant tendrils that entangled the younger students as they tried to\nrun, except Draco Malfoy, who had again vanished beneath his\ninvisibility cloak.",
      "Not-Susan-Bones stopped casting hexes. She leveled her wand,\ntook a deep breath, and cried aloud an incantation that sent golden\nworms of light chewing into the shield around Professor Sprout. At\nthat the Herbology Professor turned to face not-Susan, her\nexpression vacant, a new set of plant tentacles rising in the air\nbehind her. Those stalks were a darker green, and seemed to have\nshields of their own.",
      "Harry Potter murmured to the seemingly empty air, \"Attack\nSprout. Help Bones. Nonlethal only.\"",
      "\"Yes, my lord,\" whispered Lesath Lestrange beneath Harry's Cloak\nof Invisibility, and the fifth-year Slytherin's presence moved off\ntoward the fight.",
      "Harry looked down at at his own hands, and saw with a jolt of\nunpleasant shock that his Disillusionment Charm wasn't as complete\nas it had been before. There were hints of distortion in the air,\neach time Harry moved...",
      "Slowly, Harry stepped backward, until he came to a corner, and\nducked behind a wall. Then he took out his communications mirror...\nwhich was blank and jammed. Of course. Harry levitated the mirror\nto where he could use it to see around the corner, and watch the\nend of the... distraction? What was happening, why?",
      "Professor Sprout and the form of Susan Bones were dueling in\nflashes of light and leaves; and the blazing green of a Greater\nDrill Hex erupted from midair and chewed halfway through the outer\nlayer of Professor Sprout's shields. The Herbology Professor turned\nand fired a broad wash of yellow at where the Drill Hex had come\nfrom, but the spell didn't seem to hit anything.",
      "Yellow blazes, blue facets, dark green plant-tendrils and\nswirling purple flower petals...",
      "It was when Professor Sprout started firing arcs of crimson in\nall directions that one of the crimson blades caught something in\nmidair, the Invisibility Cloak not concealing how the crimson arc\nwas absorbed and winked out; and Lesath's presence beneath the\nInvisibility Cloak fell to the ground.",
      "And that gave not-Susan-Bones time enough to stand still, catch\nher breath, and scream something that inspired in Harry another\nsurge of dread; and the white spark that blazed out went through\nProfessor Sprout's chewed shields and her plant-armor and dropped\nher.",
      "Not-Susan-Bones went to her knees, panting, her robes soaked in\nsweat.",
      "Her head turned to look around her, at the bodies lying stunned\non the floor or wrapped in vines.",
      "\"What,\" said not-Susan. \"What. What. What.\"",
      "There was no reply. The victims entangled in Professor Sprout's\nvines weren't moving, though they did seem to be breathing.",
      "\"Malfoy...\" said the pink-haired form of Susan, still gasping\nfor breath. \"Draco Malfoy, where are you? Are you there? Call the\nAurors already! Merlin damn it - Homenum Revelio!\u202f\"",
      "And Harry found himself visible again, staring in his mirror at\nthe form of Draco Malfoy half-visible beneath a shimmering cloak,\nstanding behind not-Susan, pointing his wand at a gap in\nnot-Susan's blue haze.",
      "Harry's mind moved in flashes of insight, too slow and yet too\nfast; even as Harry's mouth opened and he inhaled in preparation to\nshout.",
      "beware the constellationthere was a constellation\nnamed Draco\nif you could control a Professor you could control a student",
      "\"Duck!\" Harry shouted, but it was too late, a bolt of\nred light caught the back of not-Susan's head at point-blank,\nsmashing her to the floor.",
      "Harry stepped around the corner and said, \"Somnium Somnium\nSomnium Somnium Somnium Somnium.\"",
      "Draco Malfoy's shimmering form collapsed in a heap.",
      "Harry took a moment to catch his breath. Then Harry said\n\"Stupefy!\u202f\" and verified that, yes, the Stunning Hex did\nhit Draco Malfoy's form.",
      "(You could be mistaken about whether a Somnium had really hit.\nHarry had seen enough horror movies, not to mention the business\nwith the Sunshine Regiment, that he wasn't about to make\nthat error again.)",
      "After a further reflection on this, Harry cast another Stunning\nHex into the prostrate form of Professor Sprout.",
      "Harry gripped his wand, staring at the scene, breathing heavily\nfrom the exhaustion. He didn't have enough magic left to cast a\nmessenger Patronus to Dumbledore and he really really\nshould have thought of that possibility immediately this time\naround. Harry started to reach back to where his mirror had fallen,\nto see if it was now unjammed.",
      "And then Harry hesitated.",
      "His note to himself had said to avoid notice from Aurors, and\nHarry still did not know what was going on.",
      "The crumpled form of Professor Quirrell gave another series of\nracking coughs, reached out a hand to the wall beside him, and\nslowly pulled himself to his feet.",
      "\"Harry,\" croaked Professor Quirrell. \"Harry. Are you there?\"",
      "It was the first time Professor Quirrell had ever called him by\nhis first name.",
      "\"I'm here,\" Harry said. Without any conscious thought, his feet\nwere moving forward.",
      "\"Please,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"Please, I haven't... much\ntime. Please take me... to the mirror... help me... get the\nStone.\"",
      "\"The Philosopher's Stone?\" Harry said. He glanced\naround at the scattered bodies, but he couldn't see Draco anymore,\nthe revealment had worn off. \"You think Mr. Nott was\nright? I don't think Dumbledore would -\"",
      "\"Not - Dumbledore,\" gasped Professor Quirrell. \"Because - Sprout\n-\"",
      "\"I understand,\" Harry said. If Dumbledore had been the one\nbehind it all, he wouldn't have needed to mind-control a Professor\nin order to use Memory Charms.",
      "\"Mirror... ancient relic... could hide anything... Stone could\nbe there... many others want Stone... one sent Sprout...\"",
      "Harry repeated rapidly, \"The mirror down there is an ancient\nrelic that can be used to hide things, and it would be one possible\nplace to hide the Philosopher's Stone. If the Philosopher's Stone\nis inside the mirror then any number of people might want to get\nit. One of them is controlling Sprout and that would explain what\ntheir goal really is... only... that doesn't explain why Sprout's\ncontroller would go after Hermione?\"",
      "\"Harry, please,\" Professor Quirrell said. His breathing was yet\nmore labored now, his voice came with excruciating slowness. \"It's\nthe one thing... that can save my life... and I find, now... I\ndon't want to die... please, help me...\"",
      "And somehow that tore it.",
      "Somehow that was a little too much.",
      "The sense of detachment that had come over Harry when Professor\nSprout had arrived, the broken suspension of disbelief, was\nreturning; his Inner Critic weighing up everything as though it\nwere a set-piece. Timing, probability, so many people showing up at\nthe same door, the Defense Professor's desperation... this whole\nsituation didn't feel real. But he might be able to solve\nit if he just took time to think things through in advance,\ninstead of running off at adventure's first call. All the\naccumulated experience from the last year had finally crystallized\ninto something like a touch of battle hardening. An instinct born\nof past disaster was telling Harry that if he just rushed on ahead,\nhe would end up afterward in a sad conversation, realizing that\nhe'd been stupid. Again.",
      "\"Let me think,\" Harry said. \"Let me think for a minute before we\ngo.\" He turned away from the Defense Professor, looking at the\nunconscious bodies draped in various shapes over the floor. There'd\nbeen so many puzzle pieces already, this last year, maybe\neverything would just fall into place with one more piece...",
      "\"Harry...\" the Defense Professor said in a faltering voice.\n\"Harry, I'm dying...\"",
      "One more minute can't make the difference he's had the WHOLE\nYEAR to be sick it's IMPROBABLE that his life versus death would be\nprecisely timed to rest on this last minute no matter what happened\nto Hermione -",
      "\"I know!\u202f\" Harry said. \"I'll think\nquickly!\u202f\"",
      "Harry stared at the bodies and tried to think. There was no time\nfor doubts, for caveats, no brakes or second-guessing just take the\nfirst thoughts and run with them -",
      "In the back of Harry's mind, fragments of abstract thought\nflitted past, heuristics of problem-solving that there was no time\nto rehearse in words. In wordless flashes they shot past, to set up\nthe object-level problem.",
      "- what do I notice I am confused by -",
      "- the first place to look for a problem is whatever aspect\nof the situation seems most improbable -",
      "- simple explanations are more probable, eliminate separate\nimprobabilities that must be postulated -",
      "Professor Snape had already been here then Professor Quirrell\nhad arrived then Harry had arrived (via Time-Turner) then the\nadventuring party had arrived and Draco had been revealed (part of\nthe party) then Professor Sprout had shown up.",
      "Too many people had shown up synchronously and that was\ntoo much coincidence, it was improbable that so many\ndifferent parties would show up at the same location within a\nfive-minute window, there had to be hidden\nentanglements.",
      "Label Sprout's controller as the mastermind who had ordered\nHermione Memory-Charmed. The mastermind had sent Sprout.",
      "Professor Snape had said that the Headmaster had sent him to\nguard the door after there'd been some sort of\ndisturbance, if the mastermind had caused that as a\ndistraction then that explained Severus's presence as well.",
      "Harry wasn't sure any more that Draco had been controlled by the\nmastermind, that hypothesis had come to him in the spur of the\nmoment, Draco might have just been trying to drop not-Susan so he\ncould get into the corridor unhindered-",
      "No that was the wrong way to think, turn it around, try to\nexplain the timed presence of Draco and his adventuring\nparty, no time for self-questioning, run with the\nhypothesis, therefore suppose Sprout's mastermind had sent\nDraco or triggered his coming.",
      "That was three arrivals explained.",
      "Harry had shown up because his note to himself had told him to\ndo so. That could be attributed to time travel.",
      "That left the Defense Professor who'd said he was following\nSnape, only that didn't really seem like an adequate\nreason for Professor Quirrell to show up it didn't really make\nHarry feel less confused and so maybe the mastermind had also\ncontrolled the timing of Professor Quirrell's presence somehow and\neven arranged for Harry himself to enter the time loop.",
      "Harry's mind hit a stumbling-block, he couldn't see how to\nextend that reasoning further.",
      "There was no time to stare blankly at stumbling-blocks.",
      "Without any pause or braking Harry's mind attacked the problem\nfrom a new angle.",
      "Professor Quirrell had deduced a controlled Hogwarts Professor\nfrom the need for some Professor to Memory-Charm Hermione which\nmeant that Professor Sprout's controller had framed and then\nmurdered Hermione which meant Professor Sprout's controller had\ndetailed information about Hogwarts life and maybe a personal\ninterest in the Boy-Who-Lived and his friends.",
      "Harry's mind finally threw up the relevant memory, Dumbledore\nsaying that Lord Voldemort's strongest road to life was hidden here\ninside Hogwarts run with the hypothesis so that\nresurrection tool was the Philosopher's Stone hidden inside the\nmirror why had Dumbledore put the mirror into a corridor\nfirst-years could get through no ignore this question it's not\nimportant right now and Professor Quirrell had said the\nPhilosopher's Stone possessed great healing power so that part also\nfit.",
      "But if it was the Philosopher's Stone that was hidden in the\nmirror to keep it away from the Dark Lord, that meant the mirror\nalso contained the one thing in the world that could save the\nDefense Professor's life -",
      "Harry's mind tried to hesitate, to flinch away, feeling a sudden\napprehension as to where this was going.",
      "But there was no time allowed for hesitation.",
      "-and that was also far too much coincidence just too much\nimprobability if your mind didn't write it off as an amazing plot\ntwist like you were inside a story.",
      "Could the putative Dark Lord also be manipulating Professor\nQuirrell so that Professor Quirrell would discover his supposed\nsalvation at the right time so that Harry and Professor Quirrell\nwould go get the resurrection tool from the mirror that might not\neven actually be the Philosopher's Stone and then the Dark Lord's\navatar or some other servant would show up and seize it from them\nthat would explain all the synchronies and negate every\ncoincidence.",
      "Or Professor Quirrell had known from the beginning that the one\nthing that could save his life was hidden inside this mirror and\nthat was why he had agreed to teach Defense at Hogwarts and now he\nwas finally trying to get it but then why wait until he was this\nsick to even try and why had Sprout shown up at the same time as\nProfessor Quirrell -",
      "Harry's mind faltered harder.",
      "His inner eye was looking in a direction it was afraid to\nlook.",
      "The note I sent myself said to help the watcher of stars. I\nwouldn't send myself a note saying that, if I hadn't already worked\nout in the future that it was the right thing to do - maybe the\nnote is just telling me to get on with it -",
      "A small note of confusion was promoted to conscious\nattention.",
      "The coded message on the parchment... one or two lines hadn't\nquite sounded right, hadn't sounded like the code Harry would\nexpect himself to use...",
      "\"Harry,\" whispered the dying voice of Professor Quirrell from\nbehind him. \"Harry, please.\"",
      "\"I'm almost done thinking,\" Harry's voice said aloud, and Harry\nrealized as he spoke the words that they were true.",
      "Turn it around.",
      "Look at it from the Enemy's perspective, from where the Enemy\ndoes their own intelligent planning, somewhere out of your\nsight.",
      "There are Aurors in Hogwarts, and your target Harry Potter is\nnow fully on guard. Harry Potter will call in Aurors at the first\nsign of trouble, or send a Patronus to Albus Dumbledore.\nConsidering that as a puzzle, one creative solution is to -",
      "- forge a supposedly Time-Turned message to Harry Potter from\nhimself, telling Harry Potter not to call for help,\ntelling him to be at the place and time you want him to be. You get\nthe target himself to bypass all the protections he set up. You\neven bypass his protection of skepticism with the overriding\nauthority of his own future self's judgment.",
      "It isn't even difficult. You can Memory-Charm some random\nstudent into remembering Harry Potter handing over an envelope to\nbe given back to himself later.",
      "You can Memory-Charm that student because you are a Hogwarts\nProfessor.",
      "You don't go to the extra effort to steal a pencil and Muggle\npaper from Harry Potter's pouch. Instead you forge Harry Potter's\nhandwriting on wizard parchment. You can forge Harry Potter's\nhandwriting because you have seen it on Ministry-mandated exams you\nhave graded.",
      "You call Draco Malfoy 'the constellation' because you know Harry\nPotter is interested in astronomy and you are a wizard and you have\ntaken Astronomy and memorised the names of all the constellations.\nBut it's not the natural code that Harry Potter would use to\ndescribe Draco Malfoy to himself, that would have been 'the\napprentice'.",
      "You call Professor Quirrell 'the watcher of stars', and tell\nHarry Potter to help him.",
      "You know that life-eater is how you say 'Dementor' in\nParseltongue and you expect Harry Potter to think of the Aurors as\nbeing in league with them.",
      "You encode 6:49 as 'six, and seven in a square' because you have\nbeen reading a Muggle physics book that Harry Potter gave you.",
      "Who are you, then?",
      "Harry noticed his breathing had sped up, and with a burst of\nheartrate, Harry slowed his breath down again, Professor Quirrell\nwas watching him.",
      "What if hypothetically speaking Professor Quirrell was the\nmastermind and had faked Harry's message then that explained all\nfive parties showing up the whole synchronous coordination of the\ncomedy and then Professor Sprout was just controlled to give\nProfessor Quirrell deniability let him blame someone else for the\nFalse Memory Charm after the dust settled but",
      "But why would Professor Quirrell risk the fragile alliance Harry\nhad with Draco via the attempted murder-frame",
      "(that Professor Quirrell had 'detected' and 'stopped' allegedly\nvia a tracer put on Draco)",
      "Why would Professor Quirrell kill Hermione",
      "(if his first attempt to remove her hadn't worked)",
      "If Professor Quirrell was the bad guy then he might have lied\nabout everything to do with horcruxes and maybe it wasn't\ncoincidence at all that the only thing that could save his life was\nthe avenue that could resurrect the Dark Lord what if the Dark Lord\nhad arranged that too somehow",
      "(one day David Monroe had mysteriously disappeared, presumed\ndead at the Dark Lord's hands)",
      "An awful intuition had come over Harry, something separate from\nall the reasoning he'd done so far, an intuition that Harry\ncouldn't put into words; except that he and the Defense Professor\nwere very much alike in certain ways, and faking a Time-Turned\nmessage was just the sort of creative method that Harry himself\nmight have tried to bypass all of a target's protections -",
      "And that was when Harry finally realized what should have been\nobvious from the very, very beginning.",
      "Professor Quirrell was smart.",
      "Professor Quirrell was smart in the same way as Harry.",
      "Professor Quirrell was smart in exactly the same way as Harry's\nmysterious dark side.",
      "If you had to guess when the Boy-Who-Lived had acquired his\nmysterious dark side, the obvious guess was the night of October\n31st, 1981.",
      "And\nAnd\nAnd Professor Quirrell had known a password that Bellatrix Black\nhad thought identified the Dark Lord and his presence gave the\nBoy-Who-Lived a sense of doom and his magic interacted\ndestructively with Harry's and his favorite spell was Avada Kedavra\nand and and -",
      "The realization blasted through Harry like a vast dam breaking,\nreleasing out all its water, bursting through his mind in an\nirresistible flood that swept everything away.",
      "There is only one reality that generates all of the\nobservations.",
      "If different observations seem to point in incompatible\ndirections, it means the true hypothesis is one you haven't thought\nof yet.",
      "And in those cases, when you finally think of the correct\nhypothesis, everything aligns behind it, beyond denial or horror,\ntearing away every doubt and every emotion that might stand in its\npath.",
      "- and then 'David Monroe' and 'Lord Voldemort' had just been one\nperson playing both sides of the Wizarding War and that was why the\nMonroe family had been killed before they could meet 'David Monroe'\njust like Moody had suspected -",
      "Reality settled down into a single known state, one coherent\nstate-of-affairs that compactly generated the observation set.",
      "Harry didn't jump, didn't change his breathing, tried not to\nshow a single sign of the horror and agony flooding his mind.",
      "The Enemy was behind him, watching him.",
      "\"All right,\" Harry said out loud, as soon as he dared trust his\nvoice to sound normal. He kept on staring at the bodies, looking\naway from Professor Quirrell, because Harry didn't trust his own\nface. Harry lifted a sleeve to wipe away the sweat on his forehead,\ntrying to make the gesture look casual; Harry couldn't control the\nsweat, or the rapid hammering in his chest. \"Let's go get the\nPhilosopher's Stone.\"",
      "All Harry needed was a single moment of distraction anywhere\nalong the way to use his Time-Turner.",
      "There was no reply from behind him.",
      "The silence stretched.",
      "Slowly, Harry turned around.",
      "Professor Quirrell was standing upright and smiling.",
      "In the Defense Professor's hand was a shape of black metal\npointed at Harry's wand arm, held with the sure grip of someone who\nknew exactly how to use a semiautomatic handgun.",
      "Harry's mouth was dry, even his lips were trembling with\nadrenaline, but he managed to speak. \"Hello, Lord Voldemort.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell inclined his head in acknowledgement, and\nsaid, \"Hello, Tom Riddle.\"",

      "Tom Riddle.",
      "The words seemed to echo inside Harry's head, sparking\nresonances that as quickly died away, broken patterns trying to\ncomplete themselves and failing.",
      "Tom Riddle is a",
      "Tom Riddle was the",
      "Riddle",
      "There were other priorities occupying Harry's attention.",
      "Professor Quirrell was pointing a gun at him.",
      "And for some reason Lord Voldemort hadn't fired it yet.",
      "Harry's voice came out in more of a croak. \"What is it that you\nwant from me?\"",
      "\"Your death,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"is clearly not what I am\nabout to say, since I have had plenty of time to kill you if I\nwished. The fateful battle between Lord Voldemort and the\nBoy-Who-Lived is a figment of Dumbledore's imagination. I know\nwhere to find your family's house in Oxford, and I am familiar with\nthe concept of sniper rifles. You would have died before you ever\ntouched a wand. I hope this is clear to you, Tom?\"",
      "\"Crystal,\" Harry whispered. His body was still shaking, running\nprograms more suited to fleeing a tiger than casting delicate\nspells or thinking. But Harry could think of one thing the\nperson pointing a gun at him obviously wanted him to do, a question\nthat person was waiting for him to ask, and Harry did so. \"Why are\nyou calling me Tom?\"",
      "Professor Quirrell regarded him steadily. \"Why am I\ncalling you Tom? Answer. Your intellect is not everything I hoped\nfor, but it should suffice for this.\"",
      "Harry's mouth seemed to know the answer before his brain could\nmanage to focus on the question. \"Tom Riddle is your name. Our\nname. That's who Lord Voldemort is, or was, or - something.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell nodded. \"Better. You have already vanquished\nthe Dark Lord, the one and only time that you will ever do so. I\nhave already destroyed all but a remnant of Harry Potter,\neliminating the difference between our spirits and enabling us to\nreside in the same world. Now that it is clear to you that the\nbattle between us is a lie, you might act sensibly to advance your\nown interests. Or you might not.\" The gun jabbed slightly forward,\ncausing prickles of sweat to appear on Harry's forehead. \"Drop your\nwand. Now.\"",
      "Harry dropped it.",
      "\"Step away from the wand,\" said Professor Quirrell.",
      "Harry obeyed.",
      "\"Reach toward your neck,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"and remove\nyour Time-Turner, touching it by the chain only. Place the\nTime-Turner on the ground, then step away from it as well.\"",
      "This also Harry did. Even in his state of shock, his mind still\nlooked for a way to spin the Time-Turner in the process, a sudden\nmove that would win; but Harry knew that Professor Quirrell would\nalready be imagining himself in Harry's position, looking for the\nsame possible opportunities.",
      "\"Remove your pouch and place it also on the ground, then step\naway.\"",
      "Harry did this.",
      "\"Very good,\" said the Defense Professor. \"Now. It is time for me\nto obtain the Philosopher's Stone. I mean to bring along these four\nfirst-years here, suitably Obliviated of their most recent memories\nso that they still recall their original purpose. Snape I shall\ncontrol and set to guard this door. After this day's work is done,\nI intend to kill Snape for the betrayals he has offered my other\nidentity. The three heir-children I shall take with me afterwards,\nto shape their future loyalties. And know this, I have taken\nhostages. I have already set in motion a spell that will kill\nhundreds of Hogwarts students, including many you called friends. I\ncan stop that spell using the Stone, if I obtain it successfully.\nIf I am interrupted before then, or if I choose not to stop the\nspell, hundreds of students will die.\" Professor Quirrell's voice\nwas still mild. \"Do you yet perceive any interests you have at\nstake, boy? I would smile to hear you say 'no', but that is too\nmuch to hope.\"",
      "\"I'd like,\" Harry managed to say, through the horror, and the\nheartbreak, and the knives slicing away at an emotional connection\nthat hurt like living flesh as it was cut, \"for you not to do those\nthings, Professor.\" Why, Professor Quirrell, why, why did it\nhave to turn out like this, I don't, I don't, I don't want this to\nbe happening...",
      "\"Very well,\" Professor Quirrell said. \"I grant you permission to\noffer me something I want.\" The gun gestured invitingly. \"That is a\nrare privilege, child. Lord Voldemort does not usually negotiate\nfor what he wants.\"",
      "Some part of Harry's mind scrabbled frantically, looking for\nsomething, anything that might be of more value to Lord Voldemort\nor Professor Quirrell than child hostages or Severus's death.",
      "Another part of him, the part that had never stopped thinking,\nalready knew his answer.",
      "\"You already have an idea for what you want from me,\" Harry\nsaid, through the sickness and the bleeding wounds in his soul.\n\"What is it?\"",
      "\"Your help in obtaining the Philosopher's Stone.\"",
      "Harry swallowed. He couldn't stop his eyes from going to the\ngun, then back up at Professor Quirrell's face.",
      "He was aware that the hero in a storybook was supposed to say\n'No', but now that he was actually in a situation like this, saying\n'No' didn't seem to make sense.",
      "\"I am disappointed that you need to think about this,\" said\nProfessor Quirrell. \"It is straightforward that you should obey me\nfor now, since I hold every advantage over you. I have taught you\nbetter than this; in this situation you should certainly pretend to\nlose. You can expect to gain nothing by resisting, except pain. You\nshould have calculated that it was better to answer sooner, and not\nearn my distrust.\" Professor Quirrell's eyes studied him curiously.\n\"Perhaps Dumbledore has filled your ears with nonsense about noble\ndefiance? I find such morals amusing, since they are so easy to\nmanipulate. I assure you that I can make defiance seem morally\nworse, and you would be well advised to submit before I demonstrate\nhow.\" The gun stayed pointed at Harry; but with a wave of Professor\nQuirrell's other hand, Tracey Davis rose up into the air, spun\nlazily, her limbs stretched out spreadeagle -",
      "- then, even as new adrenaline hammered at Harry's heart, Tracey\nfloated back down again.",
      "\"Choose,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"This begins to try my\npatience.\"",
      "I should have spoken just then, before he might've ripped\noff Tracey's legs, no, I shouldn't have, the Headmaster said I\nmustn't show Lord Voldemort that I'll do things if he threatens my\nfriends because that will just make him threaten more of them -\nonly what he said before isn't a threat it's just the sort\nof thing Lord Voldemort does -",
      "Harry took a deep breath, several of them. Whatever part of him\nkept on running on full automatic was screaming at the remainder of\nhis mind that it could not afford to stay in shock. Shocks\nwere of finite duration, neurons kept firing regardless, the only\nreason Harry's mind would shut down while his brain kept running\nwas if Harry's self-model believed his mind would shut\ndown -",
      "\"I don't mean to try your patience,\" Harry said. His voice was\ncracking. That was good. Sounding like he was still in shock meant\nthat Lord Voldemort might give him more time. \"But if Lord\nVoldemort had a reputation for keeping his bargains, I don't know\nabout it.\"",
      "\"An obvious concern,\" Professor Quirrell said. \"There is a\nsimple answer, and I would have enforced it upon you in any case.\nSsnakes can't lie. And since I have a tremendous distaste\nfor stupidity, I suggest you do not say anything like 'What do you\nmean?' You are smarter than that, and I do not have time for such\nconversations as ordinary people inflict on one another.\"",
      "Harry swallowed. Snakes can't lie. \"Two pluss two equalss\nfour.\" Harry had tried to say that two plus two equalled\nthree, and the word four had slipped out instead.",
      "\"Good. When Salazar Slytherin invoked the Parselmouth curse upon\nhimself and all his children, his true plan was to ensure his\ndescendants could trust one another's words, whatever plots they\nwove against outsiders.\" Professor Quirrell had adopted his\nlecturing pose from Battle Magic, like someone putting on a\nwell-worn mask, but the gun remained pointed in his hand.\n\"Occlumency cannot fool the Parselmouth curse as it can fool\nVeritaserum, and you may put that to the trial also. Now listen\nwell. Come with me, promisse your besst aid in getting Sstone,\nand I sshall leave thesse children behind unharmed. Hosstagess are\nreal, hundredss of sstudentss die tonight unlesss I sstop eventss\nalready sset in motion. Will sspare hosstagess if I obtain Sstone\nssuccessfully. And mark also this, mark it well: I cannot\nbe truly sslain by any means known to me, and lossing Sstone will\nnot sstop me from returning, nor sspare you or yourss my\nwrath. Any impetuous act you are contemplating cannot win the\ngame for you, boy. I do credit your ability to annoy me, and\nsuggest you avoid doing so.\"",
      "\"You said,\" Harry's voice was strange in his own ears, \"that the\nPhilosopher's Stone had different powers from what legend said. You\nsaid that to me in Parseltongue. Tell me what the Stone really\ndoes, before I agree to help you get it.\" If it was something along\nthe lines of gaining total power over the universe, then\nnothing was worth an incrementally greater chance of Lord\nVoldemort getting the Stone.",
      "\"Ah,\" said Professor Quirrell, and smiled. \"You are thinking.\nThat is better, and as a reward I shall offer you a further\nincentive for cooperation. Eternal life and youth, the creation of\ngold and silver. Suppose these are true benefits of holding the\nStone. Tell me, boy. What is the Stone's power?\"",
      "It might have been the adrenaline still in him, being actually\nuseful for his brain for once. It might have been the power of\nbeing told that an answer existed, and that the evidence wasn't a\nlie. \"It can make Transfigurations permanent.\"",
      "Then Harry stopped, as he heard what his own mouth had just\nsaid.",
      "\"Correct,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"Thus, whoever holds the\nPhilosopher's Stone is able to perform human Transfiguration.\"",
      "Harry's torn mind was knocked about yet again, as he realized\nwhat further incentive would be offered him.",
      "\"You stole Miss Granger's remains and Transfigured them into\nsome innocuous-appearing target,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"A\nTransfigured target that you must keep somewhere about your own\nperson, in order to sustain the Transfiguration. Ah, I see your\neyes going to that ring upon your hand, but of course Miss Granger\nwould not be the little jewel set into the ring, would it? That\nwould be too obvious. No, I expect you Transfigured Granger's\nremains into the ring itself, letting the aura of the Transfigured\njewel mask the magic in the Transfigured ring.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry said, forcing out the word. It was a lie, for once,\nand Harry's glance had been deliberate. Harry had expected someone\nto challenge him on the steel ring, he'd tried to provoke that\nchallenge so he could prove to be innocent yet again, though nobody\nhad taken him up on it - maybe Dumbledore had just sensed that the\nsteel by itself wasn't magical.",
      "\"Fine and good,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"Now come with me,\nhelp me to obtain the Stone, and I will resurrect Hermione Granger\non your behalf. Her death has had unfortunate effects on you, and I\nwould not mind undoing them. That, as I understand you, is your\ngreatest desire. I have done you many kindnesses, and I would not\nmind doing you this one more.\" A blank-eyed Professor Sprout had\nnow risen from the ground and was pointing her own wand at Harry.\n\"Help me obtain Sstone of Transsfiguration, and I sshall try my\nhardesst to ressurrect your girl-child friend to true and lassting\nlife. That ssaid, boy, I am sswiftly running out of patience with\nyou, and you sshall not like what comess next.\" This last line\nwas hissed out in a voice that conveyed the impression of a snake\nrearing its head to strike.",
      "Even then.",
      "Even then, with all the world upturned, with shock after shock,\neven then Harry's brain did not stop being a brain, or completing\nthe patterns its circuits had been wired to complete.",
      "Harry knew that this was too good an offer to make to someone at\nwhom you were pointing a gun.",
      "Unless you desperately needed their help to get the\nPhilosopher's Stone out of the magic mirror.",
      "And there wasn't any time left to plan, only the thought that,\nif Professor Quirrell really was going this far to get his help -\nwhat Harry wanted was to demand Professor Quirrell promise\nnot to kill anyone in the future in exchange for his help now, but\nHarry had a strong sense that Professor Quirrell would reply 'Don't\nbe ridiculous' and there wasn't time for ordinary conversation\nHarry had to guess the highest safe request in advance -",
      "Professor Quirrell's eyes narrowed, his lips parted -",
      "\"If I help you,\" Harry's mouth said, \"I want your promise that\nyou aren't planning to turn on me when this is over. I want you to\nnot kill Professor Snape or anyone else in Hogwarts for at least a\nweek. And I want answers, the truth about everything that's been\ngoing on this whole time, everything you know about my nature.\"",
      "The pale blue eyes regarded him dispassionately.",
      "I really think we could have thought of something better to\nask for than that, said Harry's Slytherin side. But I\nsuppose we were legitimately out of time, and whatever we need to\ndo next, answers will help.",
      "Harry wasn't listening to that voice right now. Cold chills were\nstill going down his spine from hearing the words that had just\ncome out of his lips, addressed to the man with the gun.",
      "\"That is your condition for helping me to obtain the Stone?\"\nsaid Professor Quirrell.",
      "Harry nodded, unable to form words.",
      "\"Agreed,\" hissed Professor Quirrell. \"Help me, and\nyou sshall have ansswerss to your quesstions, sso long ass they are\nabout passt eventss, and not my planss for the future. I do not\nintend to raisse my hand or magic againsst you in future, sso long\nass you do not raisse your hand or magic againsst me. Sshall kill\nnone within sschool groundss for a week, unlesss I musst. Now\npromisse that you will not attempt to warn againsst me or esscape.\nPromisse to put forth your own besst efforts toward helping me to\nobtain the Sstone. And your girl-child friend sshall be revived by\nme, to true life and health; nor sshall me or mine ever sseek to\nharm her.\" A twisted smile. \"Promisse, boy, and the\nbargain will be sstruck.\"",
      "\"I promise,\" whispered Harry.",
      "WHAT? screamed other parts of his mind.",
      "Um, he's still pointing a gun at us, pointed out\nSlytherin. We don't actually have a choice, we're just getting\nas much mileage out of this as possible.",
      "You bastard, said Hufflepuff. Do you think this is\nwhat Hermione would have wanted? This is Lord Voldemort we're\ntalking about, do we even know how many people he's killed, and\nwill kill?",
      "I deny that we are compromising with Lord Voldemort for\nHermione's sake, said Slytherin. Since there is, in fact,\na gun and we can't otherwise stop him. Also, Mum and Dad would want\nus to just go along and stay safe.",
      "Professor Quirrell regarded him steadily. \"Repeat the full\npromise in Parseltongue, boy.\"",
      "\"I sshall help you obtain the Sstone... I cannot promisse I\nwill usse my besst efforts, my heart will not be in it, I fear. I\nintend to try. Sshall not do anything I think will annoy you to no\ngood end. Sshall call no help if I expect them to be killed by you\nor for hosstagess to die. I'm ssorry, teacher, but it iss besst I\ncan do.\" Harry's mind was settling, composing itself, as the\ndecision was made. He would stay with Professor Quirrell, go with\nhim to get the Stone, save the student hostages, and... and... and\nHarry didn't know, except that he'd go on thinking.",
      "\"You actually are sorry about that?\" Professor Quirrell looked\namused. \"I suppose it shall have to do. Then keep two other things\nin mind: I have plan to sstop even sschoolmasster, if he\nappearss before uss. And also this: I will occasionally ask\nyou to say in Parseltongue whether you have betrayed me. The\nbargain is sstruck.\"",
      "After that, Professor Sprout picked up Harry's wand, and wrapped\nit in shimmering cloth; then she placed it on the floor, and again\npointed her wand at Harry. Only then did Professor Quirrell lower\nhis gun, which seemed to disappear into his hand, and pick up\nHarry's wrapped wand, tucking it into his robes.",
      "The True Cloak of Invisibility was removed from the sleeping\nform of Lesath Lestrange, and Professor Quirrell took the Cloak, as\nwell as Harry's pouch and Time-Turner.",
      "Then Professor Quirrell cast a mass Obliviation followed by the\nmass version of the False Memory Charm, the one that just had the\nsubject fill in the blanks using their own suggestibility, on all\nthe students present. Afterwards Professor Sprout floated away the\nsleeping children, now wearing an expression that seemed annoyed\nand preoccupied, as if they'd been in some Herbology accident.",
      "Professor Quirrell then turned back to where the Potions Master\nlay sprawled, bent over and placed his wand on Professor Snape's\nforehead. \"Alienis nervus mobile lignum.\"",
      "The Defense Professor stepped back, and began to move his left\nfingers in the air as though manipulating a puppet on strings.",
      "Professor Snape pushed himself up from the ground by smooth\nmotions, and stood once more before the corridor door.",
      "\"Alohomora,\" Professor Quirrell said, pointing his wand\nat the forbidden door. The Defense Professor looked rather amused.\n\"Would you do the honors, boy?\"",
      "Harry swallowed. He was once again having second thoughts, and\nthird thoughts.",
      "It was strange how you could do something even while knowing it\nwas the wrong thing, not the selfish thing but the wrong thing\nto do on some deeper level.",
      "But the man behind him was holding the gun; it had once more\nappeared in his hand at Harry's hesitation.",
      "Harry laid his hand on the door-knocker, and took several deep\nbreaths, again composing his mind as best he could. Go through with\nit, don't get shot, don't let the hostages die, be there to\noptimize events, be there to watch for opportunities and stay\ncapable of taking them. It wasn't a good choice, but all the other\nones seemed worse.",
      "Harry pushed open the forbidden door, and stepped through.",

      "After a single step into Dumbledore's forbidden chamber, Harry\nshrieked and jumped back and collided with Professor Snape, sending\nthe two of them down in a heap.",
      "Professor Snape picked himself up and resumed standing in front\nof the door. His head tracked to look at Harry. \"I am guarding this\ndoor at the Headmaster's orders,\" said Professor Snape in his usual\nsardonic tones. \"Be off with you at once, or I shall deduct House\nPoints.\"",
      "This was bone-chillingly creepy, but Harry's attention was\noccupied by the gigantic three-headed dog which had lunged forward,\nonly to be stopped meters from Harry by the chains upon its three\ncollars.",
      "\"That - that - that - \" Harry said.",
      "\"Yes,\" Professor Quirrell said from a ways behind him, \"that is\nindeed the usual occupant of that chamber, which is off-limits to\nall students, especially first-years.\"",
      "\"That's not safe even by wizard standards!\" Within the\nchamber, the enormous black beast gave a multi-voiced bellow,\nflecks of white saliva flying from three fanged mouths.",
      "Professor Quirrell sighed. \"It is enchanted not to eat students,\njust spit them back out through the door. Now, boy, how would you\nrecommend that we deal with this dangerous creature?\"",
      "\"Uh,\" Harry stuttered, trying to think over the continued\nroaring of the chamber's guardian. \"Uh. If it's like the Cerberus\nfrom the Muggle legend of Orpheus and Eurydice, then we have to\nsing it to sleep so we can pass -\"",
      "\"Avada Kedavra.\"",
      "The three-headed beast fell over.",
      "Harry looked back at Professor Quirrell, who was giving him a\nlook of extreme disappointment, as if to ask whether Harry had\nattended any of his classes, ever.",
      "\"I sort of assumed,\" Harry said, still trying to catch\nhis breath, \"that going through this challenge in any way except\nthe one used by first-years, might perhaps trigger an\nalarm.\"",
      "\"That is a lie, boy, you simply did not remember your lessons\nwhen you faced the occasion in true life. As for alarms, I have\nspent months befuddling all the wards and tripsigns upon these\nchambers.\"",
      "\"Then why did you send me in first, exactly?\"",
      "Professor Quirrell just smiled. It looked significantly more\nevil than usual.",
      "\"Never mind,\" Harry said, and walked slowly into the chamber,\nhis limbs still shaking.",
      "The chamber was all of stone, illuminated by a pale blue light\nthat shone from arched nooks carved into the wall; as if the light\nof a grey sky were passing through windows, though there were no\nwindows. At the far end of the chamber was a wooden trapdoor upon\nthe floor, with a single ring attached. In the middle of the\nchamber lay a gigantic dead dog with three lifeless heads.",
      "Harry turned toward one of the arched nooks and looked inside\nit. There was nothing there but the sourceless blue glow, so he\nwalked over and looked in the next one, also scrutinizing the wall\nas he passed.",
      "\"What,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"are you doing?\"",
      "\"Searching the room,\" Harry said. \"There could be a clue, or an\ninscription, or a key we'll need later, or something -\"",
      "\"Are you serious, or are you deliberately trying to slow us\ndown? Answer in Parseltongue.\"",
      "Harry looked back. \"Wass sseriouss,\" hissed Harry.\n\"Would have done ssame if came by mysself.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell briefly massaged his forehead. \"I confess,\"\nhe said, \"that your approach would serve you well in, say,\nexploring the tomb of Amon-Set, so I will not quite call you an\nidiot, but still. The false puzzle, the outer form of the\nchallenge, is a game meant for first-years. We simply go down\nthrough the trapdoor.\"",
      "Beneath the trapdoor was a gigantic plant, something like an\nenormous dieffenbachia with wide leaves emerging from the central\nstem like a spiral staircase, but darker-colored than a normal\ndieffenbachia, with tendril-like vines emerging from the central\nstem and hanging down. The base spread out wide with bigger leaves\nand tendrils, as though promising to cushion anyone's fall. Beneath\nwas another stone chamber like the first, with the same nooks like\nfalse arched windows, emitting the same grey-blue light.",
      "\"The obvious thought is to fly down on the broomstick in my\npouch, or toss something heavy to see if those tendrils are traps,\"\nHarry said, peering down. \"But I'm guessing you'll say that we just\nwalk down the leaves.\" They certainly looked like they were meant\nto be a spiral staircase.",
      "\"After you,\" said Professor Quirrell.",
      "Harry carefully put a foot down on a leaf and found that it\nindeed supported his weight. Then Harry took a last look around the\nroom before departing, to see if there was anything worth\nnoticing.",
      "The enormous dead dog called enough attention to itself that it\nwas hard to focus on anything else.",
      "\"Professor Quirrell,\" Harry said, omitting the phrase your\napproach to dealing with obstacles has certain drawbacks,\n\"what if somebody looks in the door and sees that the Cerberus is\ndead?\"",
      "\"Then they have probably already noticed something wrong with\nSnape,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"But since you insist...\" The\nDefense Professor walked over to the three-headed corpse and placed\nhis wand against it. He began a Latin-sounding incantation that was\naccompanied by a sense of rising apprehension, the Boy-Who-Lived\nfeeling the Dark Lord's power as he always had.",
      "The last word spoken was \"Inferius\" and it was\naccompanied by a final surge of STOP, DON'T.",
      "And the three-headed dog rose to a stand, its six eyes dull and\nblank, turning to watch the door once more.",
      "Harry stared at the huge Inferius with a horrible sinking\nsensation in his stomach, the third-worst feeling he'd ever felt in\nhis life.",
      "He knew then that he'd seen and sensed this procedure before,\nonly without the spoken Latin.",
      "The centaur who'd confronted him in the Forbidden Forest was\ndead. The Defense Professor had hit it with a real Avada Kedavra,\nnot a fake one.",
      "Somewhere in the back of his mind, Harry had thought that if he\ncould just get Hermione back then he could return to the\ncode of nobody dying, the ethic of Batman. Most people went through\ntheir whole lives without anyone getting killed on whatever\nadventures they had.",
      "And that was not to be.",
      "He hadn't even noticed, the day he lost his last chance to win.\nEven if Hermione was resurrected, now, Harry wouldn't have come\nthrough the whole mess without anyone getting killed.",
      "He hadn't even learned the centaur's name.",
      "Harry said nothing aloud. The Defense Professor would either\nconfirm the accusation in Parseltongue or lie in plain speech, and\neither way the Defense Professor would have more reason to suspect\nHarry's next actions. But Harry knew that - although he didn't know\nhow he would stop Professor Quirrell, although he didn't\ndare any positive act of betrayal, maybe not even making the\ndecision, until it was almost time to win - there would\nnever be an amicable settlement between him and Lord Voldemort, for\nthose two different spirits could not exist in the same world.",
      "And it was like that resolution, that knowledge of opposition,\ninvoked a strength from what Harry had thought of as his dark side.\nHarry had stopped trying to call deliberately on his dark side\nafter the day he'd killed the troll. But his dark side had never\nbeen something separate from him. It had been something remembered\nfrom Tom Riddle. Harry didn't know how that had happened, but\ntaking the assumption and running with it, whatever echoes of\ncognitive skill were in his dark side should be there for him to\nuse. Not as a separate mode, as Harry had conceptualized at first,\nbut just as neural patterns with a strong tendency to chain into\none another since they had once formed part of a connected\nwhole.",
      "This unfortunately did not change that Professor Quirrell had\nthe same skills with far more life experience backing them up, and\nalso had the gun.",
      "Harry turned, and set foot on the giant plant, and began to walk\ndown the spiral staircase provided by the leaves. It had taken\nHarry too long this time, but he'd recovered himself to some\ndegree, despite the grief still weighing him down like thick water.\nIt wasn't a cold steel rod in his spine, but it was something\nstraight and solid nonetheless. He was going to play this through,\nsee Hermione returned to life first, and then, somehow, stop\nProfessor Quirrell. Or stop Professor Quirrell first and then get\nthe Stone himself. There had to be something, some possibility,\nsome opportunity that would present itself, some way to stop\nVoldemort and return Hermione to life...",

      "The spiraling leaves of the gigantic dieffenbachia felt like\nforest loam beneath Harry's shoes, not as unyielding as concrete,\nbut supporting his weight. Harry kept a wary eye on the tendrils,\nbut they remained passive.",
      "When Harry reached the bottom of the leafy spiral staircase, the\ntendrils suddenly whipped out and grasped Harry's arms and\nlegs.",
      "After a brief struggle, Harry allowed himself to go limp.",
      "\"Interesting,\" said Professor Quirrell, as he floated down from\nabove, not touching any of the plant's leaves or tendrils. \"I\nnotice that you seem to have no trouble losing to a plant.\"",
      "Harry looked more closely at the Defense Professor, seeing him\nnow without the lens of panic. Professor Quirrell was upright and\nmoving, flying without apparent difficulty; the sense of doom about\nhim was strong. But his eyes were still sunken in the skull, his\narms thin and wasted. The sickness had not been bluff, and\nthe obvious hypothesis was that the Defense Professor had recently\neaten another unicorn to temporarily regain some strength.",
      "And the Defense Professor was also speaking like the mask of\nProfessor Quirrell, not like Lord Voldemort, which might not be a\nbad thing from Harry's perspective. Harry didn't know why - unless\nit was that the Defense Professor still needed him for something -\nbut it certainly seemed to be in Harry's own interests to play\nalong.",
      "\"You specifically let me walk into this trap, Professor,\" Harry\nanswered, just the way he'd have spoken to Professor Quirrell.\nRoles, masks, remind him of how it was between us... \"On\nmy own, I'd have used my broomstick.\"",
      "\"Perhaps. How would an ordinary first-year solve this challenge?\nIf they had their wand, that is.\" The plant was now reaching\ntendrils out toward Professor Quirrell, but Professor Quirrell was\nhovering just out of their reach.",
      "Harry had now remembered Professor Sprout talking about a\nDevil's Snare plant, which the Herbology textbook had said liked\ncool, dark places like caves - though how that could be true of a\nleafy plant was anyone's guess. \"At a guess, I'd say this is a\nDevil's Snare plant and it might retreat from light or heat. So\nmaybe a first-year could use Lumos? Today I'd use\nInflammare, but I didn't learn that spell until May.\"",
      "A twirl of the Defense Professor's wand, and a pattern of sprays\nof liquid shot out from it, striking the plant near the bases of\nits tendrils, hitting with a quiet splat and then a quiet hissing.\nAll the tendrils touching Harry frantically shot back and began to\nbeat at the growing wounds appearing on the plant's skin, as if\ntrying to remove the pain-stimulus; something about the plant gave\nthe impression that it was screaming soundlessly.",
      "Professor Quirrell finished drifting downward. \"Now it is afraid\nof light, heat, acid, and me.\"",
      "Harry stepped off the final leaves onto the floor, after a\ncareful glance at his robes and then the floor to make sure that\nnone of the acid had splashed anywhere. Harry had begun to suspect\nthat Professor Quirrell was trying to make some sort of point, but\nHarry did not know what that point might be. \"I thought we were on\na mission, Professor. I can't stop you, but is it smart to\nspend this much time on messing with me?\"",
      "\"Oh, we have time,\" said Professor Quirrell, sounding amused.\n\"There would be a great uproar if we were discovered here, guarded\nby an Inferius. You did not act like you had heard of such an\nuproar at your Quidditch match, before you arrived in this time and\nspoke to Snape as you did.\"",
      "A slight chill came over Harry, as he comprehended this.\nAnything he did to beat Professor Quirrell would have to\nnot disrupt the school, or at least the Quidditch game,\nbecause it hadn't disrupted the Quidditch game. Even if\nenough forces could be called in to subdue Lord Voldemort, it might\nnot be easy to do it without Professor McGonagall or Professor\nFlitwick or anyone else at the Quidditch game noticing...",
      "Fighting a smart enemy was hard.",
      "And even so... even so it seemed to Harry that if he stood in\nProfessor Quirrell's shoes, he would not be having leisurely\nconversations and playing mind games. Professor Quirrell was\ngaining something by taking his time here. But what? Was\nthere some other process that had to run to completion?",
      "\"By the by, have you betrayed me yet?\" said Professor\nQuirrell.",
      "\"Have not betrayed you yet,\" Harry hissed.",
      "The Defense Professor gestured pointedly with the gun he was now\nholding in his left hand, and Harry walked ahead to the great\nwooden door at the end of the room, and opened it.",
      "The next chamber was smaller in diameter, with a higher ceiling.\nThe light shining out of the arched alcoves was white, instead of\nblue.",
      "Around them whizzed hundreds of winged keys, beating frantically\nthrough the air. After watching for a few seconds, it became clear\nthat only a single key was the golden color of a Snitch - though it\nwas moving slower than a Snitch in a real Quidditch game.",
      "On the other end of the room was a door containing a large,\nprominent keyhole.",
      "Against the left wall leaned a broomstick, the school's\nworkhorse Cleansweep Seven.",
      "\"Professor,\" Harry said, staring up at the clouds and flocks of\nwhizzing keys, \"you said you would answer my questions. What\nexactly is all this about? If you think you've secured a door so\nthat it won't open without a key, you keep the key in a safe place\nand only give a copy to authorized entrants. You don't give the\nkey wings and then leave a broomstick propped against the\nwall. So what the heck are we doing in here and what is going\non? It's an obvious guess that the magic mirror is the only real\nfactor guarding the Stone, but why the rest of this - and why\nencourage first-years to come here?\"",
      "\"I am truly not sure,\" said the Defense Professor. He had\nentered the room and taken up station well to Harry's right,\nmaintaining the distance between them. \"But I shall answer, as I\nsaid I would. Dumbledore's way is to do a dozen things which seem\nmad, and then only eight of them, or perhaps nine, conceal an inner\nmeaning. My guess is that Dumbledore intends to make it seem like I\nam invited to send a student as my proxy. Precisely so that Lord\nVoldemort, as Dumbledore conceives of him, is less tempted to think\nhimself clever by doing so. Imagine Dumbledore first considering\nthe issue of how to ward the Stone. Imagine Dumbledore considering\nwhether to set true dangers to guard the Mirror. Imagine him\nimagining some young student blundering through those dangers at my\nbehest. I think that is what Dumbledore is trying to avoid, by\nmaking it seem as though that strategy is invited, and so not\ncunning. Unless, of course, I have misunderstood what Dumbledore\nthinks Lord Voldemort will think.\" Professor Quirrell grinned, and\nit looked just as natural, on him, as any grin he'd shown Harry\nbefore. \"Plotting does not come naturally to Dumbledore, but he\ntries because he must. To that task Dumbledore brings intelligence,\ndedication, the ability to learn from his mistakes, and an utter\nlack of native talent. He is marvelously hard to predict for that\nreason alone.\"",
      "Harry turned away, looking at the door on the opposite side of\nthe room. It wasn't a game to him, Professor. \"My guess is\nthat the intended solution for first-years is to ignore the\nbroomstick and use Wingardium Leviosa to grab the key,\nsince this isn't a Quidditch game and there are no rules forbidding\nthat. So what absurdly overpowered spell are you going to unleash\non this one, then?\"",
      "There was a brief silence but for the whizzing of keys.",
      "Harry took several steps away from Professor Quirrell. \"I\nprobably shouldn't have said that, should I.\"",
      "\"Oh, no,\" Professor Quirrell said. \"I think that is a quite\nreasonable thing to say to the most powerful Dark Wizard in the\nworld when he is standing not a dozen paces from you.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell put his wand back into the sleeve of his\nother hand, the hand that sometimes held the gun.",
      "Then the Defense Professor reached into his mouth and took out\nwhat appeared to be a tooth. He tossed the false tooth high in the\nair, and when it came down, it had transformed into a wand that\nsparked a strange sense of recognition in Harry's mind, as though\nsome part of him recognized that wand as being... part of\nhim...",
      "Thirteen and a half inches, yew, with a core of phoenix\nfeather. Harry had memorized the information when the\nwandmaker Olli-something had given it, because it had seemed like\nit might be Plot-Relevant. The event, and the thinking that had\nunderlain it, both felt a lifetime distant.",
      "The Defense Professor raised that wand, and traced in the air a\nflaming rune that was all jagged edges and malevolence; Harry took\nanother instinctive step back. Then Professor Quirrell spoke.\n\"Az-reth. Az-reth. Az-reth.\"",
      "The flaming rune began pouring out fire that was...\ntwisted, as though the jagged edges of the rune had become\nthe nature of the fire itself. The fire was blazing crimson, shaded\nfurther red than blood, glowing as searingly intense as an\narc-welder. That brilliance in that shade seemed wrong in\nits own right, like nothing shaded so far red should give off that\nmuch light; and the searing crimson was shot through with veins of\nblack that seemed to suck the light from the fire. Within the\nblackened fire, outlined in the interplay of crimson and darkness,\nanimal shapes twisted wildly from one predator to another, cobra to\nhyena to scorpion.",
      "\"Az-reth. Az-reth. Az-reth.\" When Professor Quirrell had\nrepeated the word six times, as much black-crimson fire had poured\nout as the volume of a small bush.",
      "The cursed fire slowed in its changes as Professor Quirrell\nlocked eyes upon it, taking on a single form, the form of a\nblackened blood-burning phoenix.",
      "And something told Harry with a terrible certainty that if that\nblack burning phoenix met Fawkes, the true phoenix would die and\nnever be reborn.",
      "Professor Quirrell made a single gesture with his wand, and the\nblackened fire went soaring across the room. It met the door and\nits keyhole, and with a single sweep of crimson-burning wings, most\nof the door and part of the archway was consumed. Then the tainted\ncrimson blaze swept on.",
      "Harry had only a glance through the hole to see huge statues\njust beginning to raise swords and clubs, when the blackened fire\ncame among them, and they cracked and burned.",
      "When it ended, the blackened-fire phoenix swept back in through\nthe hole, and hovered above Professor Quirrell's left shoulder, the\nsun-intense crimson claws staying an inch from his robes.",
      "\"Go on ahead,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"It's safe now.\"",
      "Harry walked forward, needing to invoke his dark side's\ncognitive patterns in order to maintain calm enough to do it. Harry\nstepped over the glowing edges of the remaining part of the door,\nand gazed at a chessboard of ruined huge chess-pieces. The\nalternating tiles of black and white marble on the floor started\nfive meters after the ruined doorway, and extended from wall to\nwall, but stopped five meters short of the next door on the\nopposite side of the room. The ceiling was significantly higher\nthan any of the statues should have been able to reach.",
      "\"I would guess,\" Harry said, and his dark side's cognitive\npatterns kept his voice calm, \"that the intended solution is to fly\nover the statues using the broomstick from the previous room, since\nit wasn't actually needed to get the key?\"",
      "From behind, Professor Quirrell laughed, and it was Lord\nVoldemort's laugh. \"Proceed,\" said a voice grown colder and higher.\n\"Go to the next room. I wish to see what you will make of what is\nthere.\"",
      "Arranged by Dumbledore for first-years, Harry reminded\nhimself, it WILL be safe, and he walked across the ruined\nchessboard, laid his hand upon that door's handle, and pushed it\ninward.",
      "Half a second later, Harry slammed the door and leapt back.",
      "It took Harry several seconds to master his breathing, and\nmaster himself. From behind the door came continued loud bellows,\nand great slams as of a rock club pounding the floor.",
      "\"I suppose,\" Harry said in a voice grown cold as well, \"that\nsince Dumbledore would hardly put a real mountain troll in there,\nthe next challenge is an illusion of my worst memories. Like a\nDementor, with the memory projected into the outside world. Very\namusing, Professor.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell advanced himself toward the door, and Harry\nstepped well aside. Besides the sense of doom that was now strong\nabout the Professor, Harry's dark side or just plain instinct was\nadvising him not to get anywhere near that black-crimson fire\nhovering above Professor Quirrell's shoulder.",
      "Professor Quirrell swung open the door, and looked in. \"Hm,\"\nProfessor Quirrell said. \"Just the troll, as you say. Ah, well. I\nhad hoped to learn something about you more interesting than that.\nWhat lies within is a Kokorhekkus, also known as the\ncommon boggart.\"",
      "\"A boggart? What does that - no, I suppose I know what it\ndoes.\"",
      "\"A boggart,\" Professor Quirrell said, and now his voice was\nagain that of a Hogwarts Professor lecturing, \"gravitates to dark\nenclosures that are rarely opened, such as a neglected cupboard in\nthe attic. It seeks to be left alone, and it will manifest in\nwhatever form it thinks will scare you away.\"",
      "\"Scare me away?\" Harry said. \"I killed the troll.\"",
      "\"You leapt backward out of the room without thinking. A boggart\nseeks out the instinctive flinch, not the reasoned threat. Else it\nwould have selected something more believable. In any case, the\nstandard counter-Charm for a boggart is, of course, Fiendfyre.\"\nProfessor Quirrell gestured, and the blackened fire leapt off his\nshoulder and poured through the doorway.",
      "From within the room there was a single squeak, and then\nnothing.",
      "They advanced into the boggart's former room, Professor Quirrell\ngoing first this time. With the seeming mountain troll gone, the\nroom was just another huge chamber lit by sconces of cold blue\nlight.",
      "Professor Quirrell's gaze seemed distant, thoughtful. He crossed\nthe room without waiting for Harry, and swung open the door on the\nopposite wall of his own accord.",
      "Harry followed after, and not closely.",
      "The next chamber contained a cauldron, a rack of bottled\ningredients, chopping boards, stirring sticks, and the other\napparatus of Potions. The light coming from the arched alcoves was\nwhite instead of blue, presumably because color vision was\nimportant to Potions-brewing. Professor Quirrell was already\nstanding next to the brewing apparatus, scrutinizing a long\nparchment he had picked up. The door to the next chamber was\nguarded by a curtain of purple fire that would have looked a lot\nmore threatening, if it hadn't seemed pale and weak by comparison\nto the blackened flame hovering over Professor Quirrell's\nshoulder.",
      "Harry's suspension of disbelief had already checked out on\nvacation at this point, so he didn't say anything about how\nreal-world security systems had the goal of distinguishing\nauthorized from unauthorized personnel, which meant issuing\nchallenges that behaved differently around people who were\nor weren't supposed to be there. For example, a good\nsecurity challenge would be testing whether the entrant knew a lock\ncombination that only authorized people had been told, and a\nbad security challenge would be testing whether the\nentrant could brew a potion according to written instructions that\nhad been helpfully included.",
      "Professor Quirrell tossed the parchment toward Harry, and it\nfluttured to the ground between them. \"What do you make of this?\"\nsaid Professor Quirrell, who then stepped back so that Harry could\ncome forward and pick up the parchment.",
      "\"Nope,\" Harry said after skimming the parchment. \"Testing\nwhether the entrant can solve a ridiculously straightforward logic\npuzzle about the order of the ingredients is still not a challenge\nthat behaves differently for authorized and unauthorized personnel.\nIt doesn't matter if you use a more interesting logic puzzle about\nthree idols or a line of people wearing colored hats, you're still\ncompletely missing the point.\"",
      "\"Look at the other side,\" said Professor Quirrell.",
      "Harry turned over the two-foot parchment.",
      "On the other side, written in tiny letters, was the\nlongest list of brewing instructions Harry had ever seen.\n\"What on Earth-\"",
      "\"A potion of effulgence, to quench the purple fire,\"\nProfessor Quirrell said. \"It is made by adding the same\ningredients, over and over again, in slightly different ways.\nImagine some eager young group of first-years, passing all the\nother chambers, thinking they are just about to reach the magic\nmirror, and then encountering this task. This room is the handiwork\nof the Potions Master indeed.\"",
      "Harry glanced pointedly at the blackfire shape on Professor\nQuirrell's shoulder. \"Fire can't beat fire?\"",
      "\"It can,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"I am not sure it should.\nSuppose this room is trapped?\"",
      "Harry did not want to be stuck brewing this potion for\nlaughs, or for whatever other reason Professor Quirrell was taking\nthem through these chambers so slowly. The potions recipe had\nthirty-five separate occasions for adding bellflowers,\nfourteen times to add 'a lock of bright hair'... \"Maybe the potion\ngives off a lethal gas that is fatal to adult wizards but not\nchildren. Or any of a hundred other deadly tricks, if we're\nsuddenly being serious. Are we being serious?\"",
      "\"This room is the handiwork of Severus Snape,\" Professor\nQuirrell said, once more looking thoughtful. \"Snape is not a\nbystander in this game, not quite. He lacks Dumbledore's\nintelligence, but possesses the killing intent that Dumbledore\nnever had.\"",
      "\"Well, whatever's going on here, it doesn't actually keep out\nchildren,\" Harry observed. \"Lots of first-years made it through.\nAnd if you can somehow keep out everyone except children,\nthen that, from Dumbledore's perspective, forces Lord Voldemort to\npossess a child to enter. I don't see the point, given their\ngoals.\"",
      "\"Indeed,\" Professor Quirrell said, rubbing the bridge of his\nnose. \"But see, boy, this room lacks the triggers and tripsigns\nthat are upon the others. There are no subtle wards to be defeated.\nIt is as if I am invited to bypass the Potion and simply\nenter - but Snape knows that Lord Voldemort will perceive this. If\nin fact there was a trap laid for anyone who did not brew the\npotion, then it would be wiser to lay wards, and give no sign that\nthis room was different from the others.\"",
      "Harry listened, frowning in concentration. \"So... the only point\nof leaving off the detection webs is to make you not\nbulldoze this room.\"",
      "\"I expect Snape expects me to deduce that as well,\" the Defense\nProfessor said. \"And past that point I cannot predict at what level\nhe thinks I will play. I am patient, and I have given myself plenty\nof time for this endeavor. But Snape does not know me, he only\nknows Lord Voldemort. He has sometimes seen Lord Voldemort shriek\nin frustration, and act on impulses that appear counterproductive.\nConsider this matter from Snape's perspective: it is the Potions\nMaster of Hogwarts telling Lord Voldemort to be patient and follow\ninstructions if he wants to enter, as though Lord Voldemort were a\nmere schoolboy. I would find it easy to comply, smiling the while,\nand take my vengeance later. But Snape does not know that Lord\nVoldemort finds it easy to think this way.\" Professor Quirrell\nlooked at Harry. \"Boy, you saw me floating in the air by the\nDevil's Snare, did you not?\"",
      "Harry nodded. Then he noticed his confusion. \"My Charms textbook\nsays that it's impossible for wizards to levitate themselves.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"that is what it says in your\nCharms textbook. No wizard may levitate themselves, or any object\nsupporting their own weight; it is like trying to lift yourself up\nby your own bootstraps. Yet Lord Voldemort alone can fly - how?\nAnswer as quickly as you can.\"",
      "If the question was answerable by a first-year student - \"You\nhad someone else cast broomstick enchantments on your underwear,\nthen you Obliviated them.\"",
      "\"Not quite,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"The broomstick\nenchantments require a long narrow shape, which must be solid.\nCloth will not do.\"",
      "Harry's eyebrows furrowed. \"How long does the shape have to be?\nCan you attach some short broomstick rods to a fabric harness, and\nfly using those?\"",
      "\"Indeed, at first I strapped enchanted rods to my arms and legs,\nbut that was only to teach myself a new mode of flight.\" Professor\nQuirrell drew back the sleeve of his robes, revealing the bare arm.\n\"As you can see, I have nothing up my sleeve right now.\"",
      "Harry absorbed this further constraint. \"You had someone cast\nbroomstick enchantments on your bones?\u202f\"",
      "Professor Quirrell sighed. \"And that was one of Voldemort's most\nfeared feats, or so I am told. After all these years, and some\namount of reluctant Legilimency, I still do not truly comprehend\nwhat is wrong with ordinary people... But you are not one\nof them. It is time for you to begin contributing to this\nexpedition. You have known Severus Snape more recently than I. Tell\nme your own analysis of this room.\"",
      "Harry hesitated, trying to look thoughtful.",
      "\"I will mention,\" said Professor Quirrell, as the\nblackened-fire-phoenix on his shoulder seemed to extend its head\nand glare at Harry, \"that if you knowingly allow me to fail, I will\ncall it betrayal. I remind you that the Stone is key to Miss\nGranger's resurrection, and that I hold hostage the lives of\nhundreds of students.\"",
      "\"I remember,\" Harry said, and on the heels of this Harry's\nwonderful inventive brain came up with a thought.",
      "Harry wasn't sure if he should say it.",
      "The silence stretched.",
      "\"Have you thought of anything yet?\" said Professor Quirrell.\n\"Answer in Parseltongue.\"",
      "No, this was not going to be easy, not against a smart\nopponent who could force you to tell the literal truth at any time.\n\"Severus, at least the modern-day Severus, respects your\nintelligence a great deal,\" Harry said instead. \"I think... I think\nhe might expect Voldemort to believe that Severus wouldn't\nbelieve that Voldemort could pass his test of patience, but Severus\nwould expect Voldemort to pass it.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell nodded. \"That is a plausible theory. Do you\nbelieve it yourself? Answer in Parseltongue.\"",
      "\"Yess,\" Harry hissed. It might not be safe to withhold\ninformation, not even thoughts and ideas... \"Therefore, the point\nof this room is to delay Lord Voldemort for an hour. And if I\nwanted to kill you, believing what Dumbledore believes, the obvious\nthing to try would be a Dementor's Kiss. I mean, they think you're\na disembodied soul - are you, by the way?\"",
      "Professor Quirrell was still. \"Dumbledore would not think of\nthat method,\" the Defense Professor said after a time. \"But Severus\nmight.\" Professor Quirrell began to tap a finger against his cheek,\nhis gaze distant. \"You have power over Dementors, boy, can you tell\nme if there are any nearby?\"",
      "Harry closed his eyes. If there were voids in the world, he\ncould not feel them. \"None that I can sense.\"",
      "\"Answer in Parseltongue.\"",
      "\"Do not ssensse life-eaterss.\"",
      "\"But you were being honest with me when you suggested the\npossibility? You intended no clever trickery?\"",
      "\"Wass honesst. Not trick.\"",
      "\"Perhaps there is some means by which Dementors might be\nconcealed, being told to leap out and eat a possessing soul if they\nsee one...\" Professor Quirrell was still tapping his cheek. \"It is\nnot impossible that I would qualify. Or it can be told to eat\nanyone who passes through this room too quickly, or anyone who is\nnot a child. Bearing in mind that I hold Hermione and hundreds of\nother students hostage over you, would you use your power over\nDementors to defend me, if a Dementor unmasked itself? Answer in\nParseltongue.\"",
      "\"Don't know,\" Harry hissed.",
      "\"Life-eaterss cannot desstroy me, I think,\" hissed\nProfessor Quirrell. \"And I will ssimply abandon thiss body if\nthey approach too closse. Sshall return sswiftly thiss time, and\nthen there will be no sstopping me. Will torture your parentss for\nyearss, to punissh you for balking me. Hundredss of hosstage\nsstudentss die, including thosse you call friendss. Now I assk\nagain. Will you usse power over life-eaterss to protect me, if\nlife-eaterss come?\u202f\"",
      "\"Yess,\" Harry whispered. The sadness and horror that\nHarry had pushed down flared up again, and his dark side had no\nstored patterns for handling the emotions. Why, Professor\nQuirrell, why are you like this...",
      "Professor Quirrell smiled. \"That reminds me. Have you betrayed\nme yet?\"",
      "\"Have not betrayed you yet.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell went over to the Potions equipment, and began\nchopping a root one-handed, the knife moving almost invisibly fast\nand with no apparent effort. The Fiendfyre phoenix drifted over to\nthe opposite corner of the room and waited there. \"All matters\nconsidered in their uncertainty, it seems wiser to expend the time\nto pass this room as a first-year would,\" said the Defense\nProfessor. \"We may as well talk while we are waiting. You had\nquestions, boy? I said that I would answer them, so ask.\"",

      "The Defense Professor had set up a cauldron, floating it into\nplace with a wave of his wand, another wave starting a fire beneath\nit. A brief circling of the Defense Professor's finger had set in\nmotion a long-handled spoon, and it had continued stirring the\ncauldron without being held. Now the Defense Professor was\nmeasuring out a heap of flowers from a large jar, what Harry\nsupposed to be bellflowers; the indigo petals seemed luminous in\nthe white light of the walls, and curved inward in a way that gave\nthe impression of a desire for privacy. The first of these flowers\nhad been added to the potion at once, but then the cauldron had\njust gone on stirring itself for a while.",
      "The Defense Professor had assumed a position from which he could\nsee Harry just by turning his head slightly, and Harry knew that he\nwas within the Defense Professor's peripheral vision.",
      "In the corner a Fiendfyre phoenix waited, some of the nearby\nstone beginning to gloss over as it melted to greater smoothness.\nThe burning wings shed crimson light that gave everything in the\nroom a tint of blood, and reflected in scarlet sparks from the\nglassware.",
      "\"Time is wasting,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"Ask your questions,\nif you have them.\"",
      "Why, Professor Quirrell, why, why must you be this way, why\nmake yourself the monster, why Lord Voldemort, I know you might not\nwant the same things I do, but I can't imagine what you want that\nmakes this the best way to get it...",
      "That was what Harry's brain wanted to know.",
      "What Harry needed to know was... some way out of what\nwas going to happen next. But the Defense Professor had said that\nhe wouldn't talk about his future plans. It was strange enough that\nthe Defense Professor was willing to talk about anything,\nthat had to contradict one of his Rules...",
      "\"I'm thinking,\" Harry said aloud.",
      "Professor Quirrell smiled slightly. He was using a pestle to\ngrind the potion's first magical ingredient, a glowing red hexagon.\n\"I quite understand,\" said the Defense Professor. \"But do\nnot think over-long, child.\"",
      "Goals: Prevent Lord Voldemort from harming people, find a\nway to kill or neutralise him, but first get the Stone and\nresurrect Hermione...",
      "...convince Professor Quirrell to STOP THIS...",
      "Harry swallowed, pushing down the emotion, trying not to let the\nwater reach his eyes. Tears probably wouldn't make a good\nimpression on Lord Voldemort. Professor Quirrell was already\nfrowning, though from the direction of his gaze he was examining a\nleaf colored in vivid shades of white, green, and purple.",
      "There wasn't any obvious way to reach any of the goals, not yet.\nAll Harry could do was ask the questions that seemed most likely to\nprovide useful information, even if Harry didn't yet have a\nplan.",
      "So we just ask about whatever seems most interesting?\nsaid Harry's Ravenclaw side. I'm up for that.",
      "Shut up, Harry told the voice; and then, on further\nreflection, decided that he was no longer pretending it was\nthere.",
      "Four topics came to Harry's mind as being priorities from the\nstandpoint of curiosity about important things. Four questions,\nthen, four major subjects, to try to fit in while this potion was\nstill being brewed.",
      "Four questions...",
      "\"I ask my first question,\" Harry said. \"What really happened on\nthe night of October 31st, 1981?\" Why was that night different\nfrom all other nights... \"I would like the entire story,\nplease.\"",
      "The question of how and why Lord Voldemort had survived his\napparent death seemed likely to matter for future planning.",
      "\"I expected you would ask that,\" Professor Quirrell said,\ndropping a bellflower and a white glittering stone into the potion.\n\"To begin, everything I told you about the horcrux spell is true;\nas you should realise, since I spoke in Parseltongue.\"",
      "Harry nodded.",
      "\"Within seconds after you learned the details of the spell, you\nperceived the central flaw, and began pondering how the spell might\nbe improved. Do you think the young Tom Riddle was any\ndifferent?\"",
      "Harry shook his head.",
      "\"Well, he was,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"Whenever I was tempted\nto despair of you, I reminded myself how I was an idiot at twice\nyour age. When I was fifteen I made myself a horcrux as a certain\nbook had shown me, using the death of Abigail Myrtle beneath the\neyes of Slytherin's basilisk. I planned to make a new horcrux every\nyear after I left Hogwarts, and call that my fallback plan if my\nother hopes of immortality did not come to fruition. In retrospect,\nthe young Tom Riddle was grasping straws. The thought of making a\nbetter horcrux, of not being content with the spell I had\nalready learned... this thought did not come to me until I had\ngrasped the stupidity of ordinary people, and realised which\nfollies of theirs I had imitated. But in time I learned the habit\nthat you inherited from me, to ask in every instance how it might\nbe done better. To be content with the spell I had learned from a\nbook, when it bore only a faint resemblance to what I truly wanted?\nAbsurd! And so I set forth to create a better spell.\"",
      "\"You have true immortality, now?\" Harry was aware that, even\nwith everything else going on, this was a question more important\nthan war and strategy.",
      "\"Indeed,\" said Professor Quirrell. He paused in his Potions work\nand turned to face Harry fully; there was a look of exultation in\nthe man's eyes that Harry had never seen there before. \"In all the\nDarkest Arts I could find, in all the interdicted secrets to which\nSlytherin's Monster gave me keys, in all the lore remembered among\nwizardkind, I found only hints and smatterings of what I needed. So\nI rewove it and remade it, and devised a new ritual based on new\nprinciples. I kept that ritual burning in my mind for years,\nperfecting it in imagination, pondering its meaning and making fine\nadjustments, waiting for the intention to stabilise. At last I\ndared to invoke my ritual, an invented sacrificial ritual, based on\na principle untested by all known magic. And I lived, and yet\nlive.\" The Defense Professor spoke with quiet triumph, as though\nthe act itself was so great that no words could ever do it justice.\n\"I still use the word 'horcrux', but only from sentiment. It is a\nnew thing entirely, the greatest of all my creations.\"",
      "\"As one of my questions you said you'd answer, I ask how to cast\nthat spell,\" Harry said.",
      "\"Denied.\" The Defense Professor turned back to his potion,\ndropping in a gray-flecked white feather and a bellflower. \"I had\nthought perhaps to teach you when you were older, for no Tom Riddle\nwould be content otherwise; but I have changed my mind.\"",
      "Memory is a hard thing to recall, sometimes, and Harry had been\ntrying to remember if Professor Quirrell had dropped any hints\nabout this subject before. Something about Professor Quirrell's\nphrasing sparked a memory: Perhaps you will be told when you\nare older...",
      "\"There are still physical anchors for your immortality,\" Harry\nsaid aloud. \"It resembles the old horcrux spell by that much, which\nis another reason you still call them horcruxes.\" It was dangerous\nto say aloud, but Harry needed to know. \"If I'm wrong, you\ncan always deny it in Parseltongue.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell was smiling evilly. \"Your guesss iss\nright, boy, for all the good it doess you.\"",
      "Unfortunately, that wasn't a difficult vulnerability to cover if\nthe Enemy was smart. Harry wouldn't ordinarily have made the\nsuggestion, just in case the Enemy hadn't thought of it\nfor themselves, but in this case he'd already made it. \"One horcux\ndropped into an active volcano, weighted so it would sink into the\nEarth's mantle,\" Harry said heavily. \"The same place I thought of\ndropping the Dementor if I couldn't destroy it. And then you asked\nme where else I would hide something if I didn't want anyone to\nfind it ever again. One horcrux buried kilometers down, in an\nanonymous cubic meter of the Earth's crust. One horcrux you dropped\ninto the Mariana Trench. One horcrux floating high in the\nstratosphere, transparent. Even you don't know where they are,\nbecause you Obliviated the exact details from your memory. And the\nlast horcrux is the Pioneer 11 plaque that you snuck into NASA and\nmodified. It's where you get your image of the stars, when you cast\nthe spell of starlight. Fire, earth, water, air, void.\"\nSomething of a riddle, the Defense Professor had called\nit, and therefore Harry had remembered it. Something of a\nRiddle.",
      "\"Indeed,\" said the Defense Professor. \"It did give me something\nof a shock when you remembered it that quickly, but I suppose it\nmakes no difference; all five are beyond my reach, or yours.\"",
      "That might not be true, especially if there was some way to\ntrace the magical connection somehow and determine the location...\nthough presumably Voldemort would have done his best to obscure\nit... but what magic had done, magic might be able to defeat.\nPioneer 11 might be far away by wizard standards, but NASA knew\nexactly where it was, and it was probably a lot more reachable if\nyou could use magic to tell the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation to\nbugger off...",
      "A sudden note of worry plucked at Harry's mind. There was no\nrule saying the Defense Professor needed to have told the truth\nabout which interstellar probe he'd horcruxed, and if\nHarry recalled correctly, communication and tracking of the Pioneer\n10 probe had been lost shortly after the Jupiter fly-by.",
      "Why wouldn't Professor Quirrell have just horcruxed them\nboth?",
      "The obvious next thought came to Harry. It was something that\nought not to be suggested, if the Enemy had not thought of it. But\nit seemed extremely probable that the Enemy had thought of it.",
      "\"Tell me, teacher,\" Harry hissed, \"would\ndesstroying thosse five anchors sslay you?\u202f\"",
      "\"Why do you assk?\u202f\" hissed the Defense Professor, with\na lilt to the hiss that Parseltongue translated as snakish\namusement. \"Do you ssusspect that ansswer is no?\u202f\"",
      "Harry couldn't think of how to answer, though he strongly\nsuspected that it didn't matter in any case.",
      "\"Your ssusspicion iss right, boy. Desstroying thosse five\nwould not render me mortal.\"",
      "Harry's throat felt a bit dry again. If the spell had no\ndisastrous cost associated with it... \"How many anchorss did\nyou make?\u202f\"",
      "\"Would not ordinarily ssay, but iss clear you have already\nguesssed.\" The Defense Professor's smile widened. \"Ansswer\niss that I do not know. Sstopped counting ssomewhere around one\nhundred and sseven. Ssimply made a habit of it each time I murdered\nssomeone in private.\"",
      "Over one hundred murders, in private, before Lord\nVoldemort had stopped counting. And even worse news - \"Your\nimmortality spell still requires a human death? Why?\u202f\"",
      "\"Great creation maintainss life and magic within devicess\ncreated by ssacrificing life and magic of otherss.\" Again that\nhissing snake laughter. \"Liked falsse desscription of\npreviousss horcrux sspell sso much, sso dissappointed when\nrealissed truth of it, thoughtss of improved verssion came out in\nthat sshape.\"",
      "Harry wasn't sure why the Defense Professor was giving him all\nthis vital information, but there had to be a reason, and\nthat was making him nervous. \"So you really are a disembodied\nspirit possessing Quirinus Quirrell.\"",
      "\"Yess. I sshall return sswiftly, if thiss body iss killed.\nWill be greatly annoyed, and vengeful. I am telling you this,\nboy, so that you do not try anything stupid.\"",
      "\"I understand,\" Harry said. He did his best to organize his\nthoughts, remember what he'd meant to ask next, while the Defense\nProfessor turned his eyes back to the potion. The man's left hand\nwas dribbling crushed seashell into the cauldron, while his right\nhand dropped in another bellflower. \"So what did happen on October\n31st? You... tried to turn the baby Harry Potter into a horcrux,\neither the new kind or the old kind. You did it deliberately,\nbecause you told Lily Potter,\" Harry took a breath. Now that he\nknew why the chills were there, he could endure them.\n\"Very well, I accept the bargain. Yourself to die, and the child to\nlive. Now drop your wand so that I can murder you.\" In retrospect,\nit was clear that Harry had remembered that event mainly from Lord\nVoldemort's perspective, and only at the very end had he seen it\nthrough the baby Harry Potter's eyes. \"What did you do?\nWhy did you do it?\"",
      "\"Trelawney's prophecy,\" Professor Quirrell said. His hand tapped\na bellflower with a strip of copper before dropping it in. \"I spent\nlong days pondering it, after Snape brought the prophecy to me.\nProphecies are never trivial things. And how shall I put this in a\nway that does not make you think stupid things... well, I shall say\nit, and if you are stupid I shall be annoyed. I was fascinated by\nthe prophecy's assertion that someone would be my equal, because it\nmight mean that person could hold up the other end of an\nintelligent conversation. After fifty years of being surrounded by\ngibbering stupidity, I no longer cared whether my reaction might be\nconsidered a literary cliche. I was not about to pass up on that\nopportunity without thinking about it first. And then, you see, I\nhad a clever idea.\" Professor Quirrell sighed. \"It\noccurred to me how I might fulfill the Prophecy my own way, to my\nown benefit. I would mark the baby as my equal by casting the old\nhorcrux spell in such fashion as to imprint my own spirit onto the\nbaby's blank slate; it would be a purer copy of myself, since there\nwould be no old self to mix with the new. In some years, when I had\nbecome bored with ruling Britain and moved on to other things, I\nwould arrange with the other Tom Riddle that he should appear to\nvanquish me, and he would rule over the Britain he had saved. We\nwould play the game against each other forever, keeping our lives\ninteresting amid a world of fools. I knew a dramatist would predict\nthat the two of us would end by destroying each other; but I\npondered long upon it, and decided that both of us would simply\ndecline to play out the drama. That was my decision and I was\nconfident that it would remain so; both Tom Riddles, I thought,\nwould be too intelligent to truly go down that road. The prophecy\nseemed to hint that if I destroyed all but a remnant of Harry\nPotter, then our spirits would not be so different, and we could\nexist in the same world.\"",
      "\"Something went wrong,\" Harry said. \"Something that blew off the\ntop of the Potters' home in Godric's Hollow, gave me the scar on my\nforehead, and left your burnt body behind.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell nodded. His hands had slowed in their Potions\nwork. \"The resonance in our magic,\" Professor Quirrell said\nquietly. \"When I had shaped the baby's spirit to be like my\nown...\"",
      "Harry remembered the moment in Azkaban when Professor Quirrell's\nKilling Curse had collided with his Patronus. The burning, tearing\nagony in his forehead, like his head had been about to split in\nhalf.",
      "\"I cannot count how many times I have thought of that night,\nrehearsing my mistake, thinking of wiser things I should have\ndone,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"I later decided that I should have\nthrown my wand from my hand and changed into my Animagus form. But\nthat night... that night, I instinctively tried to control the\nchaotic fluctuations in my magic, even as I felt myself burning up\nfrom inside. That was the wrong decision, and I failed. So my body\nwas destroyed, even as I overwrote the infant Harry Potter's mind;\neither of us destroying all but a remnant of the other.\nAnd then...\" Professor Quirrell's expression was controlled. \"And\nthen, when I regained consciousness inside my horcruxes, it turned\nout that my great creation did not work as I had hoped. I should\nhave been able to float free of my horcruxes and possess any victim\nthat consented to me, or that was too weak to refuse me.\nThat was the part of my great creation that failed my\nintent. As with the original horcrux spell, I would only be able to\nenter a victim who contacted the physical horcrux... and I had\nhidden my unnumbered horcruxes in places where nobody would ever\nfind them. Your instinct is correct, boy, this would not be a\ngood time to laugh.\"",
      "Harry stayed very quiet.",
      "The Potions-making had come to a temporary pause, a space where\nno ingredients were added while the cauldron simmered for a time.\n\"I spent most of my time looking at the stars,\" Professor Quirrell\nsaid, his voice quieter now. The Defense Professor had turned from\nthe potion, staring at the white-illuminated walls of the room. \"My\nremaining hope was the horcruxes I had hidden in the hopeless\nidiocy of my youth. Imbuing them into ancient lockets, instead of\nanonymous pebbles; guarding them beneath wells of poison in the\ncenter of a lake of Inferi, instead of portkeying them into the\nsea. If someone found one of those, and penetrated their ridiculous\nprotections... but that seemed like a distant hope. I was not sure\nI would ever be embodied again. Yet at least I was immortal. The\nworst of all fates had been averted, my great creation had done\nthat much. I had little left to hope for, and little left to fear.\nI decided that I would not go insane, since there seemed to be no\nadvantage in it. Instead, I gazed out at the stars and thought, as\nthe Sun slowly diminished behind me. I reflected on the errors of\nmy past life; they were many, in that hindsight. In my imagination\nI constructed powerful new rituals I might attempt, if I was free\nto use my magic once more, and yet confident of my immortality. I\ncontemplated ancient riddles at greater length than before, for all\nthat I had once thought myself patient. I knew that if I won free,\nI would be more powerful by far than in my previous life; but I\nmostly did not expect that to happen.\" Professor Quirrell turned\nback to the potion. \"Nine years and four months after that night, a\nwandering adventurer named Quirinus Quirrell won past the\nprotections guarding one of my earliest horcruxes. The rest you\nknow. And now, boy, you may say what we both know you are\nthinking.\"",
      "\"Um,\" Harry said. \"It doesn't seem like a very smart thing to\nsay -\"",
      "\"Indeed, Mr. Potter. It is not a clever thing to say to me. Not\neven a little. Not in the slightest. But I know you're thinking\nit, and you will go on thinking it and I will go\non knowing that until you say it. So speak.\"",
      "\"So. Um. I realise that this is something that is more obvious\nin hindsight than in foresight, and I'm certainly not suggesting\nthat you try to correct the error now, but if you are a Dark Lord\nand you happen to hear about a child who has been prophesied to\ndefeat you, there is a certain spell which is unblockable,\nunstoppable, and works every single time on anything with a brain\n-\"",
      "\"Yes thank you Mr. Potter that thought occurred to me\nseveral times over the next nine years.\" Professor Quirrell\npicked up another bellflower and began crumbling it in his bare\nfist. \"I made that principle the centerpiece of my Battle Magic\ncurriculum after I learned its centrality the hard way. It was\nnot the first Rule on the younger Tom Riddle's list. It is\nonly by harsh experience that we learn which principles take\npriority over which other principles; as mere words they all sound\nequally persuasive. In retrospect it would have been better if I\nhad sent Bellatrix to the Potters' home in my place; but I had a\nRule telling me that for such matters I must go myself and not try\nsending a trusted lieutenant. Yes, I considered the\nKilling Curse; but I wondered if casting the Killing Curse at an\ninfant would somehow cause the curse to bounce off and hit me, thus\nfulfilling the prophecy. How was I to know?\"",
      "\"So use an axe, it's hard to get a prophecy-fulfilling spell\nbackfire out of an axe,\" Harry said and then shut up.",
      "\"I decided the safest path was to try to fulfill the prophecy on\nmy own terms,\" Professor Quirrell said. \"Needless to say, the next\ntime I hear a prophecy I do not like, I will tear it apart at\nevery possible point of intervention, rather than trying\nto play along.\" Professor Quirrell was crushing a rose as though to\nsqueeze the juice out of it, still using his bare fist. \"And now\neveryone thinks the Boy-Who-Lived is somehow immune to the Killing\nCurse, even though Killing Curses do not ruin houses or leave burnt\nbodies behind them, because it has not occurred to them that\nLord Voldemort would ever use any other spell.\"",
      "Harry again stayed quiet. It had occurred to Harry that there\nwas another obvious way that Lord Voldemort could have avoided his\nmistake. Something that might perhaps be easier to see given a\nMuggle upbringing, instead of the wizarding way of looking at\nthings.",
      "Harry had not yet decided whether to tell Professor Quirrell\nabout his thought; there were both pros and cons to pointing out\nthat particular error.",
      "After a time Professor Quirrell picked up the next Potions\ningredient, a strand of what looked like unicorn hair. \"I tell you\nthis as a caution,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"Do not expect me to\nbe delayed another nine years, if you somehow destroy this body of\nmine. I set horcruxes in better places at once, and now even that\nis unnecessary. Thanks to you, I learned where to find the\nResurrection Stone. The Resurrection Stone does not bring back the\ndead, of course; but it holds a more ancient magic than my own for\nprojecting the seeming of a spirit. And since I am one who has\ndefeated death, Cadmus's Hallow acknowledged me its master, and\nanswered all my will. I have now incorporated it into my great\ncreation.\" Professor Quirrell smiled slightly. \"I had many years\nearlier considered making that device a horcrux, but decided\nagainst it at the time, since I realized that the ring had magic of\nunknown nature... ah, such ironies does life play upon us. But I\ndigress. You, boy, you brought that about, you freed my\nspirit to fly where it pleases and seduce the most opportune\nvictim, by being too casual with your secrets. It is a catastrophe\nfor any who oppose me, and you wrought it with one finger drawing\nwetness on a tea-saucer. This world will be a safer place for all,\nif you learn the rectitude that wizardborns absorb in childhood.\nAnd all thiss that I have jusst said iss the truth.\"",
      "Harry closed his eyes, and his own hand massaged his forehead;\nif he had seen it from the outside, it would have looked the mirror\nof Professor Quirrell in deep thought.",
      "The problem of defeating Professor Quirrell was looking\nincreasingly difficult, even by the standards of the sort of\nimpossible problems that Harry had solved already. If communicating\nthat difficulty was what Professor Quirrell was trying to do, he\nwas succeeding. Harry was starting to seriously consider\nthe possibility that it might be better to offer to rule Britain as\nVoldemort's nonhomicidal delegate, if Professor Quirrell\nhimself would just agree to stop killing people all the\ntime. Even mostly.",
      "But that wasn't likely to happen.",
      "Harry stared at his hands, from where he had sat down upon the\nfloor, feeling sadness shading over into despair. The Lord\nVoldemort who'd given Harry his dark side had spent that\nlong thinking things over and reflecting on his own thought\nprocesses... and had emerged as the calm, clear-headed, and still\nhomicidal Professor Quirrell.",
      "Professor Quirrell added a pinch of golden hair to the\npotion of effulgence, and that reminded Harry that time\nwas continuing to move; the locks of bright hair were rarer than\nthe bellflowers.",
      "\"I ask my second question,\" Harry said. \"Tell me about the\nPhilosopher's Stone. Does it do anything besides making\nTransfigurations permanent? Is it possible to make more Stones, and\nwhy is that problem hard?\"",
      "Professor Quirrell was bent over the potion, and Harry could not\nsee his face. \"Very well, I shall tell you the Stone's story as I\nhave inferred it. The one and only power of the Stone is the\nimposition of permanency, to render a temporary form into a true\nand lasting substance - a power absolutely beyond ordinary spells.\nConjurations such as the castle Hogwarts are maintained by a\nconstant well of magic. Even Metamorphmagi cannot manifest golden\nfingernails and then trim them for sale. It is theorized that the\nMetamorphmagus curse merely rearranges the substance of their\nflesh, like a Muggle smith manipulates iron with hammer and tongs;\nand their body contains no gold. If Merlin himself could create\ngold from thin air, history does not record it. So the Stone, we\ncan guess even before research, must be a very old thing indeed. In\ncontrast, Nicholas Flamel has been known to the world for a mere\nsix centuries. Tell me the obvious next question to ask, boy, if\nyou wanted to trace the Stone's history.\"",
      "\"Um,\" Harry said. He rubbed his forehead, concentrating. If the\nStone was old, but the world had only known Nicholas Flamel for six\ncenturies... \"Was there some other very long-lived wizard who\ndisappeared at around the same time Nicholas Flamel showed up?\"",
      "\"Close,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"You recall that six centuries\nago there was a Dark Lady called undying, the sorceress Baba Yaga?\nShe was said to be able to heal any wound in herself, to change\nshape into any form she pleased... she held the Stone of\nPermanency, obviously. And then one year Baba Yaga agreed to teach\nBattle Magic at Hogwarts, under an old and respected truce.\"\nProfessor Quirrell looked... angry, a look such as Harry\nhad rarely seen on him. \"But she was not trusted, and so there was\ninvoked a curse. Some curses are easier to cast when they bind\nyourself and others alike; Slytherin's Parselmouth curse is an\nexample of such. In this case, Baba Yaga's signature, and\nsignatures from every student and teacher of Hogwarts, were placed\nwithin an ancient device known as the Goblet of Fire. Baba Yaga\nswore not to shed a drop of students' blood, nor take from the\nstudents anything that was theirs. In return, the students swore\nnot to shed a drop of Baba Yaga's blood, nor take from her anything\nthat was hers. So they all signed, with the Goblet of Fire to\nwitness it and punish the transgressor.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell picked up a new ingredient, a loose thread of\ngold wrapped around a pinch of foul-looking substance. \"Entering\nher sixth year at Hogwarts, then, was a witch named Perenelle. And\nalthough Perenelle was new-come into the beauty of her youth, her\nheart was already blacker than Baba Yaga's own -\"",
      "\"You're calling her evil?\" Harry said, then realized he\nhad just committed the fallacy of ad hominem tu\nquoque.",
      "\"Hush, boy, I am telling the story. Where was I? Ah, yes,\nPerenelle, the beautiful and covetous. Perenelle seduced the Dark\nLady over the months, with gentle touches and flirtations and the\nshy pretense of innocence. The Dark Lady's heart was captured, and\nthey became lovers. And then one night Perenelle whispered how she\nhad heard of Baba Yaga's shape-changing power and how this thought\nhad enflamed her desires; thus Perenelle swayed Baba Yaga to come\nto her with the Stone in hand, to assume many guises in a single\nnight, for their pleasures. Among other forms Perenelle bid Baba\nYaga take the form of a man; and they lay together in the fashion\nof a man and a woman. But Perenelle had been a virgin until that\nnight. And since they were all rather old-fashioned in those days,\nthe Goblet of Fire accounted that as the shedding of Perenelle's\nblood, and the taking of what was hers; thus Baba Yaga was tricked\ninto being forsworn, and the Goblet rendered her defenseless. Then\nPerenelle killed the unsuspecting Baba Yaga as she slept in\nPerenelle's bed, killed the Dark Lady who had loved her and come\npeacefully to Hogwarts under truce; and that was the end of the\npact by which Dark Wizards and Witches taught Battle Magic at\nHogwarts. For the next few centuries the Goblet of Fire was used to\noversee pointless inter-school tournaments, and then it resided in\na disused chamber at Beauxbatons, until I finally stole it.\"\nProfessor Quirrell dropped a pale beige-pink twig into the\ncauldron, and its color changed to white just as it touched the\nsurface. \"But I digress. Perenelle took the Stone from Baba Yaga,\nand assumed the guise and name of Nicholas Flamel. She also kept\nher identity as Perenelle, calling herself Flamel's wife. The two\nhave appeared together in public, but that might be done by any\nnumber of obvious methods.\"",
      "\"And the Stone's manufacture?\" said Harry, his brain working to\nprocess all this. \"I saw an alchemical recipe for it, in a book\n-\"",
      "\"Another lie. Perenelle was making it appear as though 'Nicholas\nFlamel' had earned the right to live forever by completing a great\nmagic that any could attempt. And she was giving others a false\npath to pursue, instead of seeking the one true Stone as Perenelle\nhad sought Baba Yaga's.\" Professor Quirrell looked rather sour. \"It\nshould come as no surprise that I spent years trying to master that\nfalse recipe. Next you will ask why I did not kidnap, torture, and\nkill Perenelle after I learned the truth.\"",
      "This had not in fact been a question that had come into Harry's\nmind.",
      "Professor Quirrell continued to speak. \"The answer is that\nPerenelle had foreseen and forestalled the ambitions of Dark\nWizards like myself. 'Nicholas Flamel' publicly took Unbreakable\nVows not to be coerced by any means into relinquishing his Stone -\nto guard immortality from the covetous, he claimed, as if that were\na public service. I was afraid the Stone would be lost forever, if\nPerenelle died without saying where it was hidden, and her Vow\nprevented attempts at torture. Further, I had hopes of gaining\nPerenelle's knowledge, if I could find the right strategy to\nextract it from her. Though Perenelle began with little lore of her\nown, she has held hostage the lives of wizards greater than\nherself, holding out dribs and drabs of healing in exchange for\nsecrets, and small reversals of age in exchange for power.\nPerenelle does not condescend to bestow any real youth upon others\n- but if you hear of a wizard who lived, greybearded, to the age of\ntwo hundred and fifty, you may be sure that her hand was in play.\nBy my own generation, the centuries had given Perenelle enough of\nan advantage that she could raise up Albus Dumbledore as a\ncounterweight to the Dark Lord Grindelwald. When I appeared as Lord\nVoldemort, Perenelle raised up Dumbledore yet further, parceling\nout another drop of her hoarded lore whenever Lord Voldemort seemed\nto gain an advantage. I felt like I ought to be able to figure out\nsomething clever to do with that situation, but I never did. I did\nnot attack her directly, for I was not sure of my great creation;\nit was not impossible that I would someday need to go begging to\nher for a dollop of reversed age.\" Professor Quirrell dropped two\nbellflowers at once into the potion, and they seemed to merge as\nthey touched the bubbling liquid. \"But now I am sure of my\ncreation, and so I have decided that the time has come to take the\nStone by force.\"",
      "Harry hesitated. \"I would like to hear you answer in\nParseltongue, was all of that true?\"",
      "\"None of it iss known to me to be falsse,\" said\nProfessor Quirrell. \"Telling a tale implies filling in certain\ngaps; I was not present to observe when Perenelle seduced Baba\nYaga. The bassicss sshould be mosstly correct, I\nthink.\"",
      "Harry had noticed a trace of confusion. \"Then I don't\nunderstand why the Stone is here in Hogwarts. Wouldn't the best\ndefense just be hiding it under an anonymous rock in\nGreenland?\"",
      "\"Perhaps she respected my abilities as a particularly good\nfinder,\" said the Defense Professor. He appeared focused on his\ncauldron as he dipped a bellflower into a jar of liquid labeled\nwith the Potions symbol for rainwater.",
      "We are very much alike, the Defense Professor and I, in some\nways if not others. If I imagine what I'd do, given his\nproblem...",
      "\"Did you bluff everyone into believing you had some way\nof finding the Stone?\" Harry said aloud. \"So that Perenelle would\nput it inside Hogwarts, where Dumbledore could guard it?\"",
      "The Defense Professor sighed, not looking up from the cauldron.\n\"I suppose that strategem would be futile to conceal from you. Yes,\nafter I possessed Quirrell and returned, I implemented a strategy I\nhad conceived while gazing at the stars. First I made sure to be\naccepted as Defense Professor at Hogwarts, for it would not do to\nhave suspicions raised while I was still seeking employment. When\nthat was done, I arranged for one of Perenelle's curse-breaking\nexpeditions to discover a falsified but credible inscription\ndescribing how the Crown of the Serpent could be used to seek out\nthe Stone wherever it was hidden. Immediately after, before\nPerenelle could buy up the Crown, it was stolen; furthermore I left\nclear indications that the thief had possessed the power to speak\nto snakes. So Perenelle thought that I could infallibly find the\nStone's location, and that it needed a guardian powerful enough to\ndefeat me. That is how the Stone came to be held in Hogwarts, in\nDumbledore's domain. Just as I intended, naturally, since I had\nalready gained access to Hogwarts for the year. I think that is all\nof this that concerns you, if I speak not of future plans.\"",
      "Harry frowned. Professor Quirrell should not have told him that.\nUnless the strategy had somehow become irrelevant to any future\ndeception of Perenelle...? Or unless, by answering so quickly, the\nDefense Professor had hoped to have people conclude that it was a\ndouble-bluff, and that the Crown of the Serpent really could find\nthe Stone...",
      "Harry decided not to question this answer in Parseltongue.",
      "Another lock of bright hair, seeming white but not with age, was\ngently dribbled into the cauldron, again reminding Harry that they\nwere on a time limit. Harry considered, but he couldn't see any\nfurther path to pursue this line of questioning; there was no known\nway to manufacture more Philosopher's Stones and no obvious way to\ninvent such, which was probably the objectively worst news\nHarry had heard all day.",
      "Harry took a deep breath. \"I ask my third question,\" Harry said.\n\"What's the truth behind this entire school year? All the plots you\nran, all the plots you know about.\"",
      "\"Hm,\" said Professor Quirrell, dropping another bellflower into\nthe potion, accompanied by a plant-shape like a tiny cross. \"Let me\nsee... the most shocking twist is that the Defense Professor turns\nout to be secretly Voldemort.\"",
      "\"Well, obviously,\" Harry said, with a good deal of self-directed\nbitterness.",
      "\"Then where do you wish me to start?\"",
      "\"Why did you kill Hermione?\" The question just slipped out.",
      "Professor Quirrell's pale eyes glanced up from the potion,\nwatched him intently. \"One would think that should be evident - but\nI suppose I cannot blame you for distrusting what seems evident. To\nunderstand the object of an obscure plot, observe its consequences\nand ask who might have intended them. I killed Miss Granger to\nimprove your position relative to that of Lucius Malfoy, since my\nplans did not call for him to have so much leverage over you. I\nadmit I am impressed by how far you managed to parlay that\nopening.\"",
      "Harry unclenched his teeth, which took an effort. \"That's after\nyour failed attempt to frame Hermione for the attempted\nmurder of Draco and send her to Azkaban because of\nwhy? Because you didn't like the influence she was having\non me?\"",
      "\"Don't be ridiculous,\" Professor Quirrell said. \"If I had only\nwished to remove Miss Granger, I would not have brought the Malfoys\ninto it. I observed your game with Draco Malfoy and found it\namusing, but I knew it could not continue for very long before\nLucius learned and intervened; and then your folly would have\nbrought you great trouble, for Lucius would not take it lightly.\nHad you just been able to lose during the Wizengamot\ntrial, lose as I had taught you, then in only two more\nweeks, ironclad evidence would have shown that Lucius Malfoy, after\ndiscovering his son's seeming perfidy, had Imperiused Professor\nSprout into using the Blood-Cooling Charm on Mr. Malfoy and casting\nthe False Memory Charm on Miss Granger. Lucius would have been\nswept off the political gameboard, sent to exile if not Azkaban;\nDraco Malfoy would have inherited the wealth of House Malfoy, and\nyour influence over him would have been unchallenged. Instead I had\nto abort that plot in mid-course. You managed to completely disrupt\nthe real plan in the course of sacrificing double your entire\nfortune, by giving Lucius Malfoy the perfect opportunity to prove\nhis true concern for his son. You have an incredible anti-talent\nfor meddling, I must say.\"",
      "\"And you also thought,\" Harry said, even with his dark side's\npatterns he had to work to keep his voice level and cool, \"that two\nweeks in Azkaban would improve Miss Granger's disposition, and get\nher to stop being a bad influence on me. So you somehow arranged\nfor there to be newspaper stories calling for her to be sent to\nAzkaban, rather than some other penalty.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell's lips drew up in a thin smile. \"Good catch,\nboy. Yes, I thought she might serve as your Bellatrix. That\nparticular outcome would also have provided you with a constant\nreminder of how much respect was due the law, and helped you\ndevelop appropriate attitudes toward the Ministry.\"",
      "\"Your plot was stupidly complicated and had no chance of\nworking.\" Harry knew he ought to be more tactful, that he was\nengaging in more of what Professor Quirrell called folly,\nbut in that instant he could not bring himself to care.",
      "\"It was less complicated than Dumbledore's plot to have the\nthree armies tie in the Christmas Battle, and not much more\ncomplicated than my own plot to make you think Dumbledore had\nblackmailed Mr. Zabini. The insight you are missing, Mr. Potter, is\nthat these were not plots that needed to succeed.\"\nProfessor Quirrell continued to casually stir the potion, smiling.\n\"There are plots that must succeed, where you keep the\ncore idea as simple as possible and take every precaution. There\nare also plots where it is acceptable to fail, and with those you\ncan indulge yourself, or test the limits of your ability to handle\ncomplications. It was not as if something going wrong with any of\nthose plots would have killed me.\" Professor Quirrell was no longer\nsmiling. \"Our journey into Azkaban was of the first type, and I was\nless amused by your antics there.\"",
      "\"What exactly did you do to Hermione?\" Some part of\nHarry wondered at the evenness of his voice.",
      "\"Obliviations and False Memory Charms. I could not trust\nanything else to go undetected by the Hogwarts wards and the\nscrutiny I knew her mind would undergo.\" A flicker of frustration\ncrossed Professor Quirrell's face. \"Part of what you rightly call\ncomplication is because the first version of my plot did not go as\nplanned, and I had to modify it. I came to Miss Granger in the\nhallways wearing the appearance of Professor Sprout, to offer her a\nconspiracy. My first attempt at suasion failed. I Obliviated her\nand tried again with a new presentation. The second bait failed.\nThe third bait failed. The tenth bait failed. I was so\nfrustrated that I began going through my entire library of guises,\nincluding those more appropriate to Mr. Zabini. Still\nnothing worked. The child would not violate her childish\ncode.\"",
      "\"You do not get to call her childish, Professor.\"\nHarry's voice sounded strange in his own ears. \"Her code\nworked. It prevented you from tricking her. The whole\npoint of having deontological ethical injunctions is that arguments\nfor violating them are often much less trustworthy than they look.\nYou don't get to criticize her rules when they worked exactly as\nintended.\" After they resurrected Hermione, Harry would tell her\nthat Lord Voldemort himself hadn't been able to tempt her into\ndoing wrong, and that was why he'd killed her.",
      "\"Fair enough, I suppose,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"There is a\nsaying that even a stopped clock is right twice a day, and I do not\nthink Miss Granger was actually being reasonable. Still, Rule Ten:\none must not rant about the opposition's unworthiness after they\nhave foiled you. Regardless. After two full hours of failed\nattempts, I realized that I was being over-stubborn, and that I did\nnot need Miss Granger to carry out the exact part I had planned for\nher. I gave up on my original intent, and instead imbued Miss\nGranger with False Memories of watching Mr. Malfoy plotting against\nher under circumstances that implied she should not tell you or the\nauthorities. In the end it was Mr. Malfoy who gave me the opening I\nneeded, entirely by luck.\" Professor Quirrell dropped a bellflower\nand a scrap of parchment into the cauldron.",
      "\"Why did the wards show the Defense Professor as having killed\nHermione?\"",
      "\"I wore the mountain troll as a false tooth while Dumbledore was\nidentifying me to the Hogwarts wards as the Defense Professor.\" A\nslight smile. \"Other living weapons cannot be Transfigured; they\nwill not survive the disenchantment for the requisite six hours to\navoid being traced by Time-Turner. The fact that a mountain troll\nwas used as a weapon of assassination was a clear sign that the\nassassin had needed a proxy weapon that could be Transfigured\nsafely. Combined with the evidence of the wards, and Dumbledore's\nown knowledge of how he had identified me to Hogwarts, you could\nhave deduced who was responsible - in theory. However, experience\nhas taught me that such puzzles are far harder to solve when you do\nnot already know the solution, and I considered it a small risk.\nAh, that reminds me, I have a question of my own.\" The Defense\nProfessor was now giving Harry an intent look. \"What gave me away\nat the last, in the corridor outside these chambers?\"",
      "Harry put aside other emotions to weigh up the cost and benefit\nof answering honestly, came to the conclusion that the Defense\nProfessor was giving away far more information than he was getting\n(why?) and that it was best not to give the appearance of\nreticence. \"The main thing,\" Harry said, \"was that it was too\nimprobable that everyone had arrived in Dumbledore's corridor at\nthe same time. I tried running with the hypothesis that everyone\nwho arrived had to be coordinated, including you.\"",
      "\"But I had said that I was following Snape,\" the Defense\nProfessor said. \"Was that not plausible?\"",
      "\"It was, but...\" Harry said. \"Um. The laws governing what\nconstitutes a good explanation don't talk about plausible excuses\nyou hear afterward. They talk about the probabilities we assign in\nadvance. That's why science makes people do advance predictions,\ninstead of trusting explanations people come up with afterward. And\nI wouldn't have predicted in advance for you to follow Snape and\nshow up like that. Even if I'd known in advance that you could put\na trace on Snape's wand, I wouldn't have expected you to\ndo it and follow him just then. Since your explanation didn't make\nme feel like I would have predicted the outcome in advance, it\nremained an improbability. I started to wonder if Sprout's\nmastermind might have arranged for you to show up, too. And then I\nrealised the note to myself hadn't really come from future-me, and\nthat gave it away completely.\"",
      "\"Ah,\" said the Defense Professor, and sighed. \"Well, I think it\nis all working out for the best. You did understand only too late;\nand there would have been inconveniences as well as benefits to you\nremaining unaware.\"",
      "\"What on Earth were you trying to do? The reason I was\ntrying so hard to figure it out was that the whole thing was just\nso weird.\"",
      "\"That should have pointed at Dumbledore, not myself,\" said\nProfessor Quirrell, and frowned. \"The fact is that Miss Greengrass\nwas not supposed to arrive in that corridor for several hours...\nthough I suppose, since I did have Mr. Malfoy give her the clue I\nassigned her, it is not too surprising they banded together. Had\nMr. Nott arrived seemingly alone, events would have played out less\nfarcically. But I consider myself a specialist in battlefield\ncontrol magics, and I was able to ensure that the fight went as I\nwished. I suppose it did end up looking a bit ridiculous.\" The\nDefense Professor dropped a peach slice and a bellflower into the\ncauldron. \"But let us defer our discussion of the Mirror until we\nreach it. Did you have any more questions concerning Miss Granger's\nregrettable and hopefully temporary demise?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry said in an even voice. \"What did you do to the\nWeasley twins? Dumbledore thought - I mean, the school saw the\nHeadmaster go to the Weasley twins after Hermione was arrested.\nDumbledore thought you, as Voldemort, had wondered why Dumbledore\nhad done so, and that you'd checked on the Weasley twins, found and\ntook their map, and Obliviated them afterward?\"",
      "\"Dumbledore was quite correct,\" Professor Quirrell said, shaking\nhis head as though in wonderment. \"He was also an utter fool to\nleave the Hogwarts Map in the possession of those two idiots. I had\nan unpleasant shock after I recovered the Map; it showed my name\nand yours correctly! The Weasley idiots had thought it a mere\nmalfunction, especially after you received your Cloak and your\nTime-Turner. If Dumbledore had kept the Map himself - if the\nWeasleys had ever spoken of it to Dumbledore - but they did not,\nthankfully.\"",
      "Showed my name and yours correctly -",
      "\"I would like to see that,\" Harry said.",
      "Without taking his eyes from the cauldron, Professor Quirrell\ndrew a folded parchment from within his robes, hissed at it\n\"Sshow our ssurroundingss\", and tossed the folded\nparchment toward Harry. It cut unerringly through the air, an\nincrease of doom breathing on Harry's senses as it moved toward\nhim, and then it fluttered gently to Harry's feet.",
      "Harry picked up the parchment and unfolded it.",
      "At first the parchment seemed blank. Then, as though an unseen\npen were moving across it, the outline of walls and doors appeared,\nall drawn in handwritten lines. The writing outlined a series of\nchambers, most of them shown as empty; the last chamber in the\nseries had a confused scribble in its center, as though the Map\nwere trying to indicate its own bewilderment; and the\nsecond-to-last chamber showed two names within, written in\npositions within the chamber corresponding to where Harry was\nsitting and Professor Quirrell was standing.",
      "Tom M. Riddle.",
      "Tom M. Riddle.",
      "Harry gazed at the parchment, an unpleasant chill coming over\nhim. It was one thing to hear Lord Voldemort claim that your name\nwas Tom Riddle; it was another thing to find that Hogwarts's magic\nagreed. \"Did you tamper with thiss map to achieve thiss\nressult, or did it appear before you by ssurprisse?\"",
      "\"Wass ssurprisse,\" replied Professor Quirrell, with an\novertone of hissing laughter. \"No trickss.\"",
      "Harry folded the Map and threw it back in Professor Quirrell's\ndirection; some force caught it in midair before it reached the\nfloor, and drew the Map back into Professor Quirrell's robes.",
      "The Defense Professor spoke. \"I should also like to volunteer\nthat Snape was guiding Miss Granger and her underlings toward\nbullies, and sometimes intervening to protect them.\"",
      "\"I knew that.\"",
      "\"Interesting,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"Did Dumbledore also\nlearn of this? Answer in Parseltongue.\"",
      "\"Not sso far ass I know,\" hissed Harry.",
      "\"Fascinating,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"You may be interested\nto know this as well: Potionss-maker had to work in ssecret\nbecause hiss plot oppossed sschoolmasster's plot.\"",
      "Harry thought about this, while Professor Quirrell blew on the\npotion as though to cool it, though the fire still burned under the\ncauldron; then added a pinch of dirt and a drop of water and a\nbellflower. \"Please explain,\" Harry said.",
      "\"Has it never occurred to you to wonder why Dumbledore chose\nSeverus Snape as the Head of House Slytherin? To say that it was a\ncover for his work as Dumbledore's spy explains nothing. Snape\ncould have been a Potions Master only, and not the Head of\nSlytherin at all. Snape could have been made Keeper of Grounds and\nKeys, if he needed to stay within Hogwarts! Why the Head of\nHouse Slytherin? Surely it occurred to you that this could not\nhave good effects upon the Slytherins, according to Dumbledore's\nmoral pretenses?\"",
      "The thought hadn't occurred to Harry in exactly those\nterms, no... \"I wondered something like it. I didn't put the\ndilemma in that precise form.\"",
      "\"And now that you have, is the solution obvious?\"",
      "\"No,\" Harry said.",
      "\"Disappointing. You have not learned enough cynicism, you have\nnot grasped the flexibility of what moralists call\nmorality. To fathom a plot, look at the consequences and ask if\nthey might be intended. Dumbledore was deliberately sabotaging\nSlytherin House - don't give me that look, boy, I am sspeaking\ntruth. During the last Wizarding War, Slytherins filled out my\nranks of underlings, and other Slytherins in the Wizengamot\nsupported me. Look at it from Dumbledore's perspective, and\nremember that he has no native understanding of Slytherin's ways.\nThink of Dumbledore becoming increasingly sad over this Hogwarts\nHouse that seems the source of so much ill-doing. And then behold,\nDumbledore puts in as Head of Slytherin the person of Snape. Snape!\nSeverus Snape! A man who would teach his House neither cunning nor\nambition, a man who would impose lax discipline and make its\nchildren weak! A man who would offend students of other Houses, who\nwould ruin Slytherin's name among them! A man whose surname was\nunknown in magical Britain and certainly not noble, who went about\nhalf in rags! Do you think Dumbledore ignorant of the consequence?\nWhen Dumbledore was the one who brought it about, and had motive to\nbring it about? I expect Dumbledore told himself that more lives\nwould be saved during the next Wizarding War if Voldemort's future\nDeath Eaters were weakened.\" Professor Quirrell dropped into the\ncauldron a chip of ice, slowly melting as it touched the surface\nfroth. \"Continue the process long enough, and no child would want\nto go to Slytherin. The House would be retired, and if the Hat kept\ncalling the name, it would become a mark of ignominy among children\nwho would afterward be distributed among the other three Houses.\nFrom that day on, Hogwarts would have three upstanding Houses of\ncourage and scholarship and industry, with no House of Bad Children\nadded to the mix; just as if the three Founders of Hogwarts had\nbeen wise enough in the beginning to refuse Salazar Slytherin their\ncompany. That, I expect, was Dumbledore's intended end-game; a\nshort-term sacrifice for the greater good.\" Professor Quirrell\nsmiled sardonically. \"And Lucius let it all happen without protest\nor even, I expect, noticing that anything was going awry.\nI fear that in my absence my former servants have been quite\noutmatched in this battle of wits.\"",
      "Harry was having a bit of trouble taking this in, but decided,\nafter some thought, that now was not the time to try to work it\nout. Whether Lord Voldemort believed it was not decisive; Harry\nwould have to evaluate this accusation on his own.",
      "Professor Quirrell's mention of his servants had\nreminded Harry of something else that he was... obligated, Harry\nsupposed, to ask. The bad news was predictable. On any other day it\nwould have been horrible. Today it would just wash out in the\nflood. \"Bellatrix Black,\" Harry said. \"What was the truth about\nher?\"",
      "\"She was broken inside before I ever met her,\" Professor\nQuirrell said. He picked up what looked like a white-grey rubber\nband and held it over the cauldron; as the rubber was held within\nthe steam, it turned black. \"Using Legilimency on her was a\nmistake. But that glimpse showed me how easy it would be to make\nher fall in love with me, so I did. Ever after she was the most\nfaithful of all my servants, the only one I could almost trust. I\nhad no intention of giving her what she wanted from me; so I\ncommended her to the Lestrange brothers for their use, and the\nthree of them were happy in their own special way.\"",
      "\"I doubt it,\" Harry's mouth said, mostly on autopilot. \"If that\nwere true, Bellatrix wouldn't have remembered who the Lestrange\nbrothers were, when we found her in Azkaban.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell shrugged. \"You may be right.\"",
      "\"What the hell were we actually doing there?\"",
      "\"Finding out where Bellatrix had put my wand. I had told the\nDeath Eaters of my immortality, in the hope - now proven futile -\nthat they would stay together for at least a few days if I\nappeared to die. Bellatrix's instructions were to recover my wand\nfrom wherever my body had been slain; and take that wand to a\ncertain graveyard where my spirit would appear before her.\"",
      "Harry swallowed. The image came to him of Bellatrix Black\nwaiting, waiting, waiting at the graveyard, in increasing\ndesperation... it was no wonder she hadn't been thinking\nstrategically when she attacked the Longbottom household. \"What did\nyou do with Bellatrix once she was out?\"",
      "\"Ssent her to a peaceful place to recover sstrength,\"\nProfessor Quirrell said. A cold smile. \"I had a use remaining for\nher, or rather a certain portion of her, and on my future plans I\nshall not answer questions.\"",
      "Harry breathed deeply, trying to maintain control. \"Were there\nany other secret plots in this school year?\"",
      "\"Oh, a fair number, but not many more that concern you, not that\nI can think of offhand. The true reason I demanded to try to teach\nthe Patronus Charm to first-years was to bring a Dementor before\nyour own person, and then I arranged for your wand to fall where\nthe Dementor could continue to drain you through it. Wass no\nmalice in it, only hopess that you would recover ssome of your true\nmemoriess. That was also why I arranged for certain witches to\npull you down from the air during your rooftop episode, so I could\nappear to save your life; just in case any suspicion fell on me\nduring the Dementor incident I had scheduled for shortly after.\nAlsso no malice there. I arranged some of the attacks on\nMiss Granger's group, so that the attacks could be defeated; I do\nrather dislike bullies. Think that iss all ssecret plotss\nconcerning you from thiss sschool-year, unless I have forgotten\nssomething.\"",
      "Life lesson learned, said his Hufflepart. Try to\nresist the temptation to randomly meddle in other people's lives.\nLike, you know, Padma Patil's life. If you don't want to end up\nlike this, that is.",
      "A pinch of red-brown dust was gently sifted into the potions\ncauldron, and Harry asked his fourth and final question, the one\nthat had seemed to have the lowest priority, but still\nmattered.",
      "\"What was your objective during the Wizarding War?\" Harry said.\n\"I mean, what -\" His voice wobbled. \"What was the point of\nthe entire thing?\u202f\" His brain repeating endlessly,\nWhy, why, why Lord Voldemort...",
      "Professor Quirrell lifted an eyebrow. \"They told you about David\nMonroe, did they not?\"",
      "\"Yes you were both David Monroe and Lord Voldemort during the\nWizarding War, I understood that part. You killed David Monroe,\ndisguised yourself as him, and wiped out David Monroe's family so\nthey wouldn't notice any differences -\"",
      "\"Indeed.\"",
      "\"You planned to control whichever side won the Wizarding War,\nregardless of which side won. But why did one side have to be\nVoldemort? I, I mean, wouldn't it have been easier to gain\npublic support with someone less... with someone less\nVoldemort?\"",
      "Professor Quirrell's mallet made an unusually loud thud\nas it crushed white butterfly wings, mixing them with another\nbellflower. \"I planned,\" Professor Quirrell said harshly,\n\"for Lord Voldemort to lose to David Monroe. The flaw in\nthat strategy was the absolute wretchedness of -\" Professor\nQuirrell stopped. \"No, I am telling the tale out of order. Listen,\nboy, when I had devised my great creation and come into the\nfullness of my magic, I thought the time had come for me to take\npolitical power into my hands. It would be inconvenient, certainly,\nand take up my time in ways that were not enjoyable. But I knew the\nMuggles would eventually destroy the world or make war on\nwizardkind or both, and something had to be done if I was not to\nwander a dead or dull world through my eternity. Having attained\nimmortality I needed a new ambition to occupy my decades, and to\nprevent the Muggles from ruining everything seemed a goal of\nacceptable scope and difficulty. It is a source of continual\namusement to me that I, of all people, am the only one really\ntaking action towards that end. Though I suppose it would make\nsense for the mortal insects not to care about their world's end;\nwhy should they, when they are just going to die regardless, and\ncan save themselves the inconvenience of trying to do anything\ndifficult along the way? But I digress. I saw how Dumbledore had\nrisen to power from his defeat of Grindelwald, so I thought I would\ndo the same. I had long ago taken my vengeance on David Monroe - he\nwas an annoyance from my year in Slytherin - so I bethought to also\nsteal his identity, and wipe out his family to make myself heir of\nhis House. And I conceived also a great foe for David Monroe to\nfight, the most terrifying Dark Lord imaginable, clever beyond\nreckoning; more dangerous by far than Grindelwald, for his\nintelligence would be perfected in all the ways that Grindelwald\nhad been flawed and self-destructive. A Dark Lord who would do his\ncunning utmost to disrupt the alliances who would fight him, a Dark\nLord who would command the deepest loyalty from his followers\nthrough his oratical skills. The most dreadful Dark Lord who had\never threatened Britain or the world, that was who David Monroe\nwould defeat.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell's mallet struck a bellflower and then a\ndifferent pale flower with two more thuds. \"But then, while I had\nsometimes played the part of Dark Wizard in my wanderings, I had\nnever adopted the identity of a full-fledged Dark Lord with\nunderlings and a political agenda. I had no practice at the task,\nand I was mindful of the story of Dark Evangel and the disaster of\nher first public appearance. According to what she said afterward,\nshe had meant to call herself the Walking Catastrophe and the\nApostle of Darkness, but in the excitement of the moment she\nintroduced herself as the Apostrophe of Darkness instead. After\nthat she had to ruin two entire villages before anyone took her\nseriously.\"",
      "\"So you decided to try a small-scale experiment first,\" Harry\nsaid. A sickness rose up in him, because in that moment Harry\nunderstood, he saw himself reflected; the next step was\njust what Harry himself would have done, if he'd had no trace of\nethics whatsoever, if he'd been that empty inside. \"You created a\ndisposable identity, to learn how the ropes worked, and get your\nmistakes out of the way.\"",
      "\"Indeed. Before becoming a truly terrible Dark Lord for David\nMonroe to fight, I first created for practice the persona of a Dark\nLord with glowing red eyes, pointlessly cruel to his underlings,\npursuing a political agenda of naked personal ambition combined\nwith blood purism as argued by drunks in Knockturn Alley. My first\nunderlings were hired in a tavern, given cloaks and skull masks,\nand told to introduce themselves as Death Eaters.\"",
      "The sick sense of understanding deepened, in the pit of Harry's\nstomach. \"And you called yourself Voldemort.\"",
      "\"Just so, General Chaos.\" Professor Quirrell was grinning, from\nwhere he stood by the cauldron. \"I wanted it to be an anagram of my\nname, but that would only have worked if I'd conveniently been\ngiven the middle name of 'Marvolo', and then it would have been a\nstretch. Our actual middle name is Morfin, if you're curious. But I\ndigress. I thought Voldemort's career would last only a few months,\na year at the longest, before the Aurors brought down his\nunderlings and the disposable Dark Lord vanished. As you perceive,\nI had vastly overestimated my competition. And I could not\nquite bring myself to torture my underlings when they\nbrought me bad news, no matter what Dark Lords did in plays. I\ncould not quite manage to argue the tenets of blood purism\nas incoherently as if I were a drunk in Knockturn Alley. I was not\ntrying to be clever when I sent my underlings on their missions,\nbut neither did I give them entirely pointless orders -\" Professor\nQuirrell gave a rueful grin that, in another context, might have\nbeen called charming. \"One month after that, Bellatrix Black\nprostrated herself before me, and after three months Lucius Malfoy\nwas negotiating with me over glasses of expensive Firewhiskey. I\nsighed, gave up all hope for wizardkind, and began as David Monroe\nto oppose this fearsome Lord Voldemort.\"",
      "\"And then what happened -\"",
      "A snarl contorted Professor Quirrell's face. \"The absolute\ninadequacy of every single institution in the civilization of\nmagical Britain is what happened! You cannot comprehend it, boy! I\ncannot comprehend it! It has to be seen and even then it cannot be\nbelieved! You will have observed, perhaps, that of your fellow\nstudents who speak of their family's occupations, three in four\nseem to mention jobs in some part or another of the Ministry. You\nwill wonder how a country can manage to employ three of its four\ncitizens in bureaucracy. The answer is that if they did not all\nprevent each other from doing their jobs, none of them would have\nany work left to do! The Aurors were competent as individual\nfighters, they did fight Dark Wizards and only the best survived to\ntrain new recruits, but their leadership was in absolute disarray.\nThe Ministry was so busy routing papers that the country had\nno effective opposition to Voldemort's attacks except\nmyself, Dumbledore, and a handful of untrained irregulars. A\nshiftless, incompetent, cowardly layabout, Mundungus Fletcher, was\nconsidered a key asset in the Order of the Phoenix - because, being\notherwise unemployed, he did not need to juggle another job! I\ntried weakening Voldemort's attacks, to see if it was\npossible for him to lose; at once the Ministry committed\nfewer Aurors to oppose me! I had read Mao's Little Red Book, I had\ntrained my Death Eaters in guerilla tactics - for nothing! For\nnothing! I was attacking all of magical Britain and in every\nengagement my forces outnumbered their opposition! In\ndesperation, I ordered my Death Eaters to systematically\nassassinate every single incompetent managing the Department of\nMagical Law Enforcement. One paper-pusher after another volunteered\nto accept higher positions despite the fate of their predecessors,\ngleefully rubbing their hands at the prospect of promotion. Every\none of them thought they would cut a deal with Lord Voldemort on\nthe side. It took seven months to murder our way through\nthem all, and not a single Death Eater asked why we were bothering.\nAnd then, even with Bartemius Crouch risen to Director and Amelia\nBones as Head Auror, it was still too little. I could have done\nbetter fighting alone. Dumbledore's aid was not worth his\nmoral restraints, and Crouch's aid was not worth his respect for\nthe law.\" Professor Quirrell turned up the fire beneath the\npotion.",
      "\"And eventually,\" Harry said through the heart-sickness, \"you\nrealized you were just having more fun as Voldemort.\"",
      "\"It is the least annoying role I have ever played. If Lord\nVoldemort says that something is to be done, people obey\nhim and do not argue. I did not have to suppress my\nimpulse to Cruciate people being idiots; for once it was all part\nof the role. If someone was making the game less pleasant for me, I\njust said Avadakedavra regardless of whether that was\nstrategically wise, and they never bothered me again.\" Professor\nQuirrell casually chopped a small worm into bits. \"But my true\nepiphany came on a certain day when David Monroe was trying to get\nan entry permit for an Asian instructor in combat tactics, and a\nMinistry clerk denied it, smiling smugly. I asked the Ministry\nclerk if he understood that this measure was meant to save his\nlife and the Ministry clerk only smiled more. Then in fury I\nthrew aside masks and caution, I used my Legilimency, I dipped my\nfingers into the cesspit of his stupidity and tore out the\ntruth from his mind. I did not understand and I wanted to\nunderstand. With my command of Legilimency I forced his tiny\nclerk-brain to live out alternatives, seeing what his clerk-brain\nwould think of Lucius Malfoy, or Lord Voldemort, or Dumbledore\nstanding in my place.\" Professor Quirrell's hands had slowed, as he\ndelicately peeled bits and small strips from a chunk of candle-wax.\n\"What I finally realized that day is complicated, boy, which is why\nI did not understand it earlier in life. To you I shall try to\ndescribe it anyway. Today I know that Dumbledore does not stand at\nthe top of the world, for all that he is the Supreme Mugwump of the\nInternational Confederation. People speak ill of Dumbledore openly,\nthey criticize him proudly and to his face, in a way they would not\ndare stand up to Lucius Malfoy. You have acted\ndisrespectfully toward Dumbledore, boy, do you know why you did\nso?\"",
      "\"I'm... not sure,\" Harry said. Having Tom Riddle's leftover\nneural patterns was certainly an obvious hypothesis.",
      "\"Wolves, dogs, even chickens, fight for dominance among\nthemselves. What I finally understood, from that clerk's mind, was\nthat to him Lucius Malfoy had dominance, Lord Voldemort had\ndominance, and David Monroe and Albus Dumbledore did not. By taking\nthe side of good, by professing to abide in the light, we had made\nourselves unthreatening. In Britain, Lucius Malfoy has\ndominance, for he can call in your loans, or send Ministry\nbureaucrats against your shop, or crucify you in the Daily\nProphet, if you go openly against his will. And the most\npowerful wizard in the world has no dominance, because everyone\nknows that he is,\" Professor Quirrell's lips curled, \"a hero\nout of stories, relentlessly self-effacing and too humble for\nvengeance. Tell me, child, have you ever seen a drama where the\nhero, before he consents to save his country, demands so much gold\nas a barrister might receive for a court case?\"",
      "\"Actually there have been a lot of heroes like that in\nMuggle fiction, I'll name Han Solo just to start-\"",
      "\"Well, in magical drama it is not so. It is all humble heroes\nlike Dumbledore. It is the fantasy of the powerful slave\nwho will never truly rise above you, never demand your respect,\nnever even ask you for pay. Do you understand now?\"",
      "\"I... think so,\" Harry said. Frodo and Samwise from Lord of\nthe Rings did seem to match the archetype of a completely\nnon-threatening hero. \"You're saying that's how people think of\nDumbledore? I don't believe the Hogwarts students see him as a\nhobbit.\"",
      "\"In Hogwarts, Dumbledore does punish certain transgressions\nagainst his will, so he is feared to some degree - though the\nstudents still make free to mock him in more than whispers. Outside\nthis castle, Dumbledore is sneered at; they began to call him mad,\nand he aped the part like a fool. Step into the role of a savior\nout of plays, and people see you as a slave to whose services they\nare entitled and whom it is their enjoyment to criticize; for it is\nthe privilege of masters to sit back and call forth helpful\ncorrections while the slaves labor. Only in the tales of the\nancient Greeks, from when men were less sophisticated in their\ndelusions, may you see the hero who is also high. Hector, Aeneas,\nthose were heroes who retained their right of vengeance upon those\nwho insulted them, who could demand gold and jewels in payment for\ntheir services without sparking indignation. And if Lord Voldemort\nconquered Britain, he might then condescend to show himself noble\nin victory; and nobody would take his goodwill for granted, nor\nchirp corrections at him if his work was not to their liking. When\nhe won, he would have true respect. I understood that day\nin the Ministry that by envying Dumbledore, I had shown myself as\ndeluded as Dumbledore himself. I understood that I had been trying\nfor the wrong place all along. You should know this to be true,\nboy, for you have made freer to speak ill of Dumbledore than you\never dared speak ill of me. Even in your own thoughts, I wager, for\ninstinct runs deep. You knew that it might be to your cost to mock\nthe strong and vengeful Professor Quirrell, but that there was no\ncost in disrespecting the weak and harmless Dumbledore.\"",
      "\"Thank you,\" Harry said through the pain, \"for that valuable\nlesson, Professor Quirrell, I see that you are right about what my\nmind was doing.\" Though Tom Riddle's memories had probably also had\nsomething to do with the way he had sometimes lashed out at\nDumbledore for no good reason, Harry hadn't been like that around\nProfessor McGonagall... who admittedly had the power to deduct\nHouse Points and didn't have Dumbledore's air of tolerance... no,\nit was still true, Harry would have been more respectful even in\nhis own thoughts if Dumbledore had not seemed safe to\ndisrespect.",
      "So that had been David Monroe, and that had been Lord\nVoldemort...",
      "It still hadn't answered the most puzzling question, and Harry\nwasn't sure that asking it would be wise. If, somehow, Lord\nVoldemort had managed not to think of it, and then\nProfessor Quirrell had still managed not to think of it during nine\nyears of contemplation, then it wasn't wise to say... or maybe it\nwas; the agonies of the Wizarding War had not been good for\nBritain.",
      "Harry decided, and spoke. \"One thing that did confuse me was why\nthe Wizarding War lasted so long,\" Harry ventured. \"I mean, maybe\nI'm underestimating the difficulties that were facing Lord\nVoldemort-\"",
      "\"You want to know why I did not Imperius some of the stronger\nwizards who could Imperius others, slay the very strongest wizards\nwho could have resisted my Imperius, and take over the Ministry in,\noh, perhaps three days.\"",
      "Harry nodded silently.",
      "Professor Quirrell looked contemplative; his hand was sifting\ngrass clippings into the cauldron, bit by bit. That ingredient, if\nHarry remembered correctly, was something like four-fifths towards\nthe end of the recipe.",
      "\"I wondered that myself,\" the Defense Professor said finally,\n\"when I heard Trelawney's prophecy from Snape, and I contemplated\nthe past as well as the future. If you had asked my past self why\nhe did not use the Imperius, he would have spoken of the need to be\nseen to rule, to openly command the Ministry bureaucracy,\nbefore it was time to turn his eyes outward to other countries. He\nwould have remarked on how a quick and silent victory might bring\nchallenges later. He would have remarked on the obstacle presented\nby Dumbledore and his incredible defensive prowess. And he would\nhave had similar excuses for every other quick path he considered.\nSomehow it was never the right time to bring my plans to their\nfinal phase, there was always one more thing to do first. Then I\nheard the prophecy and I knew that it was time, for Time\nitself was taking notice of me. That the span for hesitation was\ndone. And I looked back, and realised somehow this had been going\non for years. I think...\" The occasional bit of grass was still\ndropping down from his hand, but Professor Quirrell did not seem to\npay it any mind. \"I thought, when I was contemplating my past\nbeneath the starlight, that I had become too accustomed to playing\nagainst Dumbledore. Dumbledore was intelligent, he tried diligently\nto be cunning, he did not wait for me to strike but presented me\nwith surprises. He made bizarre moves that played out in\nfascinating and unpredictable ways. In retrospect, there were many\nobvious plans for destroying Dumbledore; but I think some part of\nme did not want to go back to playing solitaire instead of chess.\nIt was when I had the prospect of creating another Tom Riddle to\nplot against, someone even more worthy than Dumbledore, that I was\nfirst willing to contemplate the end of my war. Yes, in retrospect\nthat sounds stupid, but sometimes our emotions are more foolish\nthan we can bring our reason to admit. I would never have espoused\nsuch a policy deliberately. It would have violated Rules Nine,\nSixteen, Twenty, and Twenty-two and that is too much even if you\nare enjoying yourself. But to repeatedly decide that there was one\nmore thing left to be done, one more advantage left to be gained,\none more piece that I simply had to move into place,\nbefore abandoning an enjoyable time in my life and moving on to the\nmore tedious rulership of Britain... well, even I am not immune to\na mistake like that, if I do not realize that I am making it.\"",
      "And that was when Harry knew what was going to happen at the end\nof this, after the Philosopher's Stone had been retrieved.",
      "At the end of this, Professor Quirrell was going to kill\nhim.",
      "Professor Quirrell didn't want to kill him. It was possible that\nHarry was the only person in the world against whom Professor\nQuirrell wouldn't be able to use a Killing Curse. But\nProfessor Quirrell thought he had to do it, for whatever\nreason.",
      "That was why Professor Quirrell had decided that it was\nnecessary to brew the potion of effulgence the long way.\nThat was why Professor Quirrell had been so easily negotiated into\nanswering these questions, into finally talking about his life with\nsomeone who might understand. Just like Lord Voldemort had delayed\nthe end of the Wizarding War to play longer against Dumbledore.",
      "Harry couldn't exactly recall what Professor Quirrell had said\nearlier about not killing Harry. It hadn't been anything\nstraightforward along the lines of 'I am absolutely not planning to\nkill you in any way, shape, or form unless you positively insist on\ndoing something stupid'. Harry had been reluctant himself to push\nthe promise too far and insist on unambiguous terms because Harry\nhad already known that he would need to neutralize Lord Voldemort\nand had expected more precise language to reveal that fact, if they\ntried to exchange truly binding promises. So there certainly would\nhave been loopholes, whatever had been said.",
      "There was no particular shock to the realization, just an\nincreased sense of urgency; some part of Harry had already known\nthis, and had simply been waiting for an excuse to make it known to\ndeliberation. There had been too many things said here that\nProfessor Quirrell would not reveal to anyone with an expected\nlifespan measured in more than hours. The overwhelming isolation\nand loneliness of the life Professor Quirrell had described might\nexplain why he was willing to violate his Rules and talk with\nHarry, given that Harry was going to die soon and that the\nworld did not actually work like a play where the villain\ndisclosing his plans would always fail to kill the hero afterward.\nBut Harry's death certainly had to be in those future plans\nsomewhere.",
      "Harry swallowed, controlling his breathing. Professor Quirrell\nhad just added a tuft of horsehair to the potion of\neffulgence, and that was very late in the potion, if Harry\nremembered correctly. There weren't many bellflowers left in the\nheap to be added, either.",
      "It was probably time to stop worrying so much about risk and\nplay this conversation less conservatively, all things\nconsidered.",
      "\"If I point out one of Lord Voldemort's mistakes,\" Harry said,\n\"does he punish me for it?\"",
      "Professor Quirrell lifted his eyebrows. \"Not if the mistake is a\nreal one. I do not suggest that you moralise at me. But I would not\ncurse the bearer of bad news, nor the subordinate who makes an\nhonest attempt to point out a problem. Even as Lord Voldemort I\ncould never bring myself to that stupidity. Of course, there were\nsome fools who mistook my policy for weakness, who tried to thrust\nthemselves forward by pushing me down in their public counsel,\nthinking me obliged to tolerate it as criticism.\" Professor\nQuirrell smiled reminiscently. \"The Death Eaters were better off\nwithout them, and I do not advise you make the same mistake.\"",
      "Harry nodded, a slight shiver going through him. \"Um, when you\ntold me about what happened in Godric's Hollow, on Halloween night,\nin 1981 I mean, um... I thought I saw another flaw in your\nreasoning. A way you could have avoided disaster. But, um, I think\nyou have a blind spot, a class of strategies you don't consider, so\nyou didn't see it even afterward-\"",
      "\"I hope you are not about to say anything stupid along the lines\nof 'don't try to kill people',\" Professor Quirrell said. \"I shall\nbe unhappy if that is the case.\"",
      "\"Not valuess difference. True misstake, given your goalss.\nWill you hurt me, if I act the part of the teacher toward you, and\nteach lessson? Or if misstake is ssimple and obviousss, and makess\nyou feel sstupid?\"",
      "\"No,\" hissed Professor Quirrell. \"Not if lessson\niss true.\"",
      "Harry swallowed. \"Um. Why didn't you test the horcrux system\nbefore you actually had to use it?\"",
      "\"Test it?\" said Professor Quirrell. He looked up from the\nbrewing potion, and indignation came into his voice. \"What do you\nmean, test it?\u202f\"",
      "\"Why didn't you test if the horcrux system was working\ncorrectly, before you needed it on Halloween?\"",
      "Professor Quirrell looked disgusted. \"You ridiculous - I didn't\nwant to die, Mr. Potter, and that was the only way to test\nmy great creation! What good would it have done to risk my life\nsooner rather than later? How would I have been better off?\"",
      "Harry swallowed a lump in his throat. \"There wass way for\nyou to tesst your horcrux ssysstem without dying. The general\nlesson is important. Do you see it now?\"",
      "\"No,\" Professor Quirrell said after a while. The Defense\nProfessor gently crumbled one of the last bellflowers together with\na strand of long blonde hair and then dropped it into the potion,\nwhich was bubbling brighter, now. Only two more bellflowers\nremained on the Potions table. \"And I do hope your lesson is a\nsensible one, for your sake.\"",
      "\"Suppose, Professor, that I learned how to cast the improved\nhorcrux spell and I was willing to use it. What would I do with\nit?\"",
      "Professor Quirrell answered at once. \"You would find some person\nwhom you found morally abhorrent and whose death you could convince\nyourself would save other lives, and murder them to create a\nhorcrux.\"",
      "\"And then what?\"",
      "\"Make more horcruxes,\" said the Defense Professor. He picked up\na jar of what looked like dragon scales.",
      "\"Before that,\" Harry said.",
      "After a time the Defense Professor shook his head. \"I still do\nnot see it, and you will cease this game and tell me.\"",
      "\"I would make horcruxes for my friends. If you'd ever really\ncared about one single other person in the entire world, if there'd\nbeen just one person who gave your immortality meaning,\nsomeone that you wanted to live forever with you -\"\nHarry's throat choked. \"Then, then the idea of making a horcrux for\nsomeone else wouldn't have been such a counterintuitive thought.\"\nHarry was blinking hard. \"You have a blind spot around strategies\nthat involve doing nice things for other people, to the point where\nit stops you from achieving your selfish values. You think... it's\nnot your style, I suppose. That... particular part of your\nself-image... is what cost you those nine years.\"",
      "The dropper of mint oil that the Defense Professor was holding\nadded liquid to the cauldron, drip by drip.",
      "\"I see...\" the Defense Professor said slowly. \"I see. I should\nhave taught Rabastan the advanced horcrux ritual, and forced him to\ntest the invention. Yes, that is supremely obvious in retrospect.\nFor that matter, I could have ordered Rabastan to try marking\nhimself onto some disposable infant, to see what happened, before I\ntook myself to Godric's Hollow to create you.\" Professor Quirrell\nshook his head bemusedly. \"Well. I am glad I am realizing this now\nand not ten years earlier; I had enough to chide myself for at that\ntime.\"",
      "\"You don't see nice ways to do the things you want to\ndo,\" Harry said. His ears heard a note of desperation in his\nown voice. \"Even when a nice strategy would be more\neffective you don't see it because you have a self-image of\nnot being nice.\"",
      "\"That is a fair observation,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"Indeed,\nnow that you have pointed it out, I have just now thought of some\nnice things I can do this very day, to further my agenda.\"",
      "Harry just looked at him.",
      "Professor Quirrell was smiling. \"Your lesson is a good one, Mr.\nPotter. From now on, until I learn the trick of it, I shall keep\ndiligent watch for cunning strategies that involve doing kindnesses\nfor other people. Go and practice acts of goodwill, perhaps, until\nmy mind goes there easily.\"",
      "Cold chills ran down Harry's spine.",
      "Professor Quirrell had said this without the slightest visible\nhesitation.",
      "Lord Voldemort was absolutely certain that he could never be\nredeemed. He wasn't the tiniest bit afraid of it happening to\nhim.",
      "The second-to-last bellflower was dropped into the potion,\ngently.",
      "\"Any other valuable lessons you would like to teach to Lord\nVoldemort, boy?\" said Professor Quirrell. He was looking up from\nthe potion, and grinning as though he knew exactly what Harry was\nthinking.",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry said, his voice almost breaking. \"If your goal is\nto obtain happiness, then doing nice things for other people feels\nbetter than doing them for yourself-\"",
      "\"Do you really think I never thought of that, boy?\" The\nsmile had vanished. \"Do you think I am stupid? After graduating\nHogwarts I wandered the world for years, before I returned to\nBritain as Lord Voldemort. I have put on more faces than I bothered\ncounting. Do you think I never tried to play the hero, just to see\nhow it would feel? Have you come across the name of Alexander\nChernyshov? Under that guise, I sought out a forlorn hellhole ruled\nover by a Dark Wizard, and I freed the wretched inhabitants from\ntheir bondage. They wept tears of gratitude for me. It did not feel\nlike anything in particular. I even stayed about and killed the\nnext five Dark Wizards to try taking command of the place. I spent\nmy own Galleons - well, not my own Galleons, but the same principle\napplies - to prettify their little country and introduce a\nsemblance of order. They groveled all the more, and named one in\nthree of their infants Alexander. I still felt nothing, so I nodded\nto myself, wrote it off as a fair try, and went upon my way.\"",
      "\"And were you happy as Lord Voldemort, then?\" Harry's voice had\nrisen, grown wild.",
      "Professor Quirrell hesitated, then shrugged. \"It appears you\nalready know the answer to that.\"",
      "\"Then why? Why be Voldemort if it doesn't even make\nyou happy?\u202f\" Harry's voice broke. \"I'm you, I'm based\non you, so I know that Professor Quirrell isn't just a\nmask! I know he's somebody you really could have been! Why\nnot just stay that way? Take your curse off the Defense Position\nand just stay here, use the Philosopher's Stone to take\nDavid Monroe's shape and let the real Quirinus Quirrell go free, if\nyou say you'll stop killing people I'll swear not to tell anyone\nwho you really are, just be Professor Quirrell, for\nalways! Your students would appreciate you, my father's\nstudents appreciate him -\"",
      "Professor Quirrell was chuckling over the cauldron as he stirred\nit. \"There are perhaps fifteen thousand wizards living in magical\nBritain, child. There used to be more. There's a reason they're\nafraid to speak my name. You'd forgive me that because you liked my\nBattle Magic lessons?\"",
      "Seconded, said Harry's inner Hufflepuff. Seriously,\nwhat the hell?",
      "Harry kept his head raised, though it was trembling. \"It's not\nmy place to forgive anything you've done. But it's better than\nanother war.\"",
      "\"Ha,\" said the Defense Professor. \"If you ever find a\nTime-Turner that goes back forty years and can alter history, be\nsure to tell Dumbledore that before he rejects Tom Riddle's\napplication for the Defense position. But alas, I fear that\nProfessor Riddle would not have found lasting happiness in\nHogwarts.\"",
      "\"Why not?\u202f\"",
      "\"Because I still would've been surrounded by idiots, and I\nwouldn't have been able to kill them,\" Professor Quirrell said\nmildly. \"Killing idiots is my great joy in life, and I'll thank you\nnot to speak ill of it until you've tried it for yourself.\"",
      "\"There's something that would make you happier than\nthat,\" Harry said, his voice breaking again. \"There has to be.\"",
      "\"Why?\" said Professor Quirrell. \"Is this some scientific law I\nhave not yet encountered? Tell me of it.\"",
      "Harry opened his mouth, but couldn't find any words, there had\nto be something had to be something if he could just find\nthe right thing to say -",
      "\"And you,\" said Professor Quirrell, \"have no right to\nspeak of happiness either. Happiness is not what you hold precious\nabove all. You decided that in the beginning, all the way back in\nthe beginning of this year, when the Sorting Hat offered you\nHufflepuff. Which I know about, because I received a similar offer\nand warning all those years ago, and I refused it just as you did.\nBeyond this there is little more to say, between Tom Riddles.\" The\nDefense Professor turned back to the cauldron.",
      "Before Harry could think of any way to reply, Professor Quirrell\ndropped in the last bellflower, and a burst of glowing bubbles\nboiled up from the cauldron.",
      "\"I believe we are done here,\" Professor Quirrell said. \"If you\nhave further questions, they must wait.\"",
      "Harry shakily rose to his feet; even as Professor Quirrell took\nup the cauldron and poured out a ridiculously huge volume of\neffulgent liquid, more than seemed like it could fit in a dozen\ncauldrons, onto the purple fire that guarded the doorway.",
      "The purple fire winked out.",
      "\"Now for the Mirror,\" said Professor Quirrell, and he drew forth\nthe Cloak of Invisibility from his robes, and floated it to drop\nbefore Harry's shoes."

      "Even the greatest artifact can be defeated by a\ncounter-artifact that is lesser, but specialized.",
      "That was what the Defense Professor had told Harry, after\ndropping the True Cloak of Invisibility to pool in fuliginous folds\nnear Harry's shoes.",
      "The Mirror of Perfect Reflection has power over what is\nreflected within it, and that power is said to be unchallengeable.\nBut since the True Cloak of Invisibility produces a perfect absence\nof image, it should evade this principle rather than challenging\nit.",
      "There had followed a series of questions in Parseltongue\nestablishing that Harry currently did not intend to do anything\nstupid or try to run away, and further reminders that Professor\nQuirrell could sense him and had spells to detect the Cloak and was\nholding hostage hundreds of lives plus Hermione.",
      "Then Harry was told to don the Cloak, open the door that lay\nbeyond the quenched fires, and advance through the door into the\nfinal chamber; as Professor Quirrell stood well back, outside of\nthat door's sight.",
      "The last chamber was illuminated in lights of soft gold, and the\nstone walls were of gentle white and faced with marble.",
      "In the center of the room stood a simple and unornamented golden\nframe, and within the frame was a portal to another\ngold-illuminated room, beyond whose door which lay another Potions\nchamber; that was what Harry's brain told him. The Mirror's\ntransformation of light was so perfect that conscious thought was\nrequired to deduce that the room inside the frame was only a\nreflection, rather than a portal. (Though it might have been easier\nto intuit if Harry hadn't been invisible, just then.)",
      "The Mirror did not touch the ground; the golden frame had no\nfeet. It didn't look like it was hovering; it looked like it was\nfixed in place, more solid and more motionless than the walls\nthemselves, like it was nailed to the reference frame of the\nEarth's motion.",
      "\"Is the Mirror there? Is it moving?\" came Professor Quirrell's\ncommanding voice from the Potions Chamber.",
      "\"Iss there,\" Harry hissed back. \"Not\nmoving.\"",
      "Again tones of command rang forth. \"Walk around to the back of\nthe Mirror.\"",
      "From behind, the golden frame appeared solid, showing no\nreflections, and Harry said so in Parseltongue.",
      "\"Now take off your Cloak,\" commanded Professor Quirrell's voice\nstill from within the Potions room. \"Report to me at once if the\nMirror moves to face you.\"",
      "Harry took off his Cloak.",
      "The Mirror remained nailed to the reference frame of Earth's\nmotion; and Harry reported this.",
      "Shortly after there came a hissing and seething, and a balefire\nphoenix melted through the marble wall behind Harry, the ambient\nlight in the room taking on a red tinge as it entered. Professor\nQuirrell followed behind it, walking out of the new-made corridor\nthat had been carved, his black formal shoes unharmed by the\nred-glowing molten surface beneath. \"Well,\" Professor Quirrell\nsaid, \"that is one possible trap averted. And now...\" Professor\nQuirrell exhaled. \"Now we will think of possible strategies for\nretrieving the Stone from the Mirror, and you will try them; for I\nprefer not to let my own image be reflected. I give you fair\nwarning, this is the part that may prove tedious.\"",
      "\"I take it this isn't a problem you can solve with\nFiendfyre?\"",
      "\"Ha,\" said Professor Quirrell, and gestured.",
      "The balefire phoenix moved forward in a rush of crimson terror,\nthe red light casting writhing shadows on the remaining marble\nwalls. Harry jumped back before he could think.",
      "The dreadful dark-red blaze rushed past Professor Quirrell,\nsurged into the golden back of the Mirror, and disappeared as fast\nas it touched the gold.",
      "Then the fire was gone, and the room was tinged scarlet no\nmore.",
      "There was no scratch upon the golden surface, no glow to mark\nthe absorption of heat. The Mirror had simply remained in place,\nuntouched.",
      "Chills went down Harry's spine. If he'd been playing Dungeons\nand Dragons and the dungeon master had reported that result, Harry\nwould have suspected a mental illusion, and rolled to\ndisbelieve.",
      "Upon the center of the golden back had appeared a sequence of\nrunes in no known alphabet, black absences of light in small lines\nand curves, arranged in a level horizontal row. The thought\noccurred to Harry that some minor concealing illusion had been\nconsumed in the Fiendfyre, a far lesser enchantment that had been\nadded to prevent children from seeing those letters...",
      "\"How old is this Mirror?\" Harry said in almost a whisper.",
      "\"Nobody knows, Mr. Potter.\" The Defense Professor reached out\nhis fingers toward the runes, a look of something like reverence on\nhis face; but his fingers did not touch the gold. \"But my guess is\nthe same as yours, I think. It is said, in certain legends that may\nor may not be fabrications, that this Mirror reflects\nitself perfectly and therefore its existence is absolutely\nstable. So stable that the Mirror was able to survive when every\nother effect of Atlantis was undone, all its consequences severed\nfrom Time. You can see why I was amused when you suggested\nFiendfyre.\" The Defense Professor let his hand fall.",
      "Even in the middle of everything else, Harry felt the awe, if\nthat was true. The golden frame gleamed no brighter than before,\nfor all the revelation; but you could imagine it going back, and\nback, into a civilization that had been made to never be... \"What -\ndoes the Mirror do, exactly?\"",
      "\"An excellent question,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"The answer is\nin the runes that are written upon the Mirror's golden frame. Read\nthem to me.\"",
      "\"They're not in any alphabet I recognize. They look like\nrandomly oriented chicken-scratches drawn by Tolkien elves.\"",
      "\"Read them anyway. Iss not dangerouss.\"",
      "\"The runes say, noitilov detalo partxe tnere hoc ruoy tu\nbecafruoy ton wo hsi -\" Harry stopped, feeling more prickles\nat his spine.",
      "Harry knew what the rune for noitilov meant. It meant\nnoitilov. And the next runes said to detalo the noitilov until it\nreached partxe, then keep the part that was both tnere and hoc.\nThat belief felt like knowledge, like he could have answered 'Yes'\nwith confident authority if somebody asked him whether the ton wo\nwas ruoy or becafruoy. It was just that when Harry tried to relate\nthose concepts to any other concepts, he drew a blank.",
      "\"Do you undersstand what wordss mean, boy?\"",
      "\"Don't think sso.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell gave a soft exhalation, his eyes not leaving\nthe golden frame. \"I had wondered if perhaps the Words of False\nComprehension might be understandable to a student of Muggle\nscience. Apparently not.\"",
      "\"Maybe -\" Harry began.",
      "Really, Ravenclaw? said Slytherin. You're pulling\nthis NOW?",
      "\"Maybe I could try again to understand the words if I knew more\nabout the Mirror?\" said Harry's Ravenclaw part, which had assumed\ndirect control.",
      "Professor Quirrell's lips quirked up. \"As with most ancient\nthings, scholars have written down enough lies that it is hard to\nbe sure of anything by now. It is definite that the Mirror is at\nleast as old as Merlin, for it is known that Merlin used it as a\ntool. It is also known that after his death, Merlin left written\ninstructions that the Mirror did not need to be sealed away,\ndespite it having certain powers that might normally cause one to\nworry. He wrote that, given how painstakingly the Mirror had been\ncrafted to not destroy the world, it would be easier to destroy the\nworld using a lump of cheese.\"",
      "This statement struck Harry as not entirely reassuring.",
      "\"Certain other facts about the Mirror are attested by famous\nwizards who were reasonably skeptical, and whose word has otherwise\nproven reliable. The Mirror's most characteristic power is to\ncreate alternate realms of existence, though these realms are only\nas large in size as what can be seen within the Mirror; it is known\nthat people and other objects can be stored therein. It is claimed\nby several authorities that the Mirror alone of all magics\npossesses a true moral orientation, though I am not sure what that\ncould mean in practical terms. I would expect moralists to call the\nCruciatus Curse by their name of 'evil' and the Patronus Charm by\ntheir name of 'good'; I cannot guess what a moralist would think\nwas any more moral than that. But it is claimed, for\nexample, that phoenixes came into our world from a realm that was\nevoked inside this Mirror.\"",
      "Words like Jeepers and what his parents would have\ntermed inappropriate language were all running through Harry's\nhead, none very coherently, as he stared at the golden back of the\nMirror.",
      "\"I have wandered the world and encountered many stories that are\nnot often heard,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"Most of them seemed to\nme to be lies, but a few had the ring of history rather than\nstorytelling. Upon a wall of metal in a place where no one had come\nfor centuries, I found written the claim that some Atlanteans\nforesaw their world's end, and sought to forge a device of great\npower to avert the inevitable catastrophe. If that device had been\ncompleted, the story claimed, it would have become an absolutely\nstable existence that could withstand the channeling of unlimited\nmagic in order to grant wishes. And also - this was said to be the\nvastly harder task - the device would somehow avert the inevitable\ncatastrophes any sane person would expect to follow from that\npremise. The aspect I found interesting was that, according to the\ntale writ upon those metal plates, the rest of Atlantis ignored\nthis project and went upon their ways. It was sometimes praised as\na noble public endeavor, but nearly all other Atlanteans found more\nimportant things to do on any given day than help. Even the\nAtlantean nobles ignored the prospect of somebody other than\nthemselves obtaining unchallengeable power, which a less\nexperienced cynic might expect to catch their attention. With\nrelatively little support, the tiny handful of would-be makers of\nthis device labored under working conditions that were not so much\ndramatically arduous, as pointlessly annoying. Eventually time ran\nout and Atlantis was destroyed with the device still far from\ncomplete. I recognise certain echoes of my own experience that one\ndoes not usually see invented in mere tales.\" A twist in the dry\nsmile. \"But perhaps that is merely my own preference for one tale\namong a hundred other legends. You perceive, however, the echo of\nMerlin's statement about the Mirror's creators shaping it to not\ndestroy the world. Most importantly for our purposes, it may\nexplain why the Mirror would have the previously unknown capability\nthat Dumbledore or Perenelle seems to have evoked, of showing any\nperson who steps before it an illusion of a world in which one of\ntheir desires has been fulfilled. It is the sort of sensible\nprecaution you can imagine someone building into a wish-granting\ncreation meant to not go horribly wrong.\"",
      "\"Wow,\" Harry whispered, and meant it. This was Magic with a\ncapital M, the sort of Magic that appeared in So You Want To Be\nA Wizard, not just a collection of random physics-violating\nthings you could do with a wand.",
      "Professor Quirrell gestured at the golden back. \"The final\nproperty upon which most tales agree, is that whatever the unknown\nmeans of commanding the Mirror - of that Key there are no plausible\naccounts - the Mirror's instructions cannot be shaped to react to\nindividual people. So it is not possible for Perenelle to command\nthis Mirror, 'only give the Stone to Perenelle'. Dumbledore cannot\nstate, 'Only give the Stone to one who wishes to give it to\nNicholas Flamel'. There is in the Mirror a blindness such as\nphilosophers have attributed to ideal justice; it must treat all\nwho come before it by the same rule, whatever rule may be in force.\nThus, there must be some rule for reaching the Stone's hiding-place\nwhich anyone can invoke. And now you see why you, called\nthe Boy-Who-Lived, shall implement whatever strategies the two of\nus devise. For it was said that this thing possesses a moral\norientation, and it may have been given commands reflecting the\nsame. I am well aware that on conventional terms you are said to be\nGood, just as I am said to be Evil.\" Professor Quirrell smiled,\nrather darkly. \"So as our first attempt - though not our last, rest\nassured-let us see what this Mirror makes of your attempt to\nretrieve the Stone in order to save the life of Hermione Granger\nand hundreds of your fellow students.\"",
      "\"And the first version of that plan,\" said Harry, who\nwas beginning to finally understand, \"the one you invented on\nFriday in my first week of Hogwarts, called for the Stone to be\nretrieved by Dumbledore's golden child, the Boy-Who-Lived, making a\nselfless and noble attempt to save the life of his dying Defense\nteacher, Professor Quirrell.\"",
      "\"Of course,\" said Professor Quirrell.",
      "It was a poetical sort of plot, Harry supposed, but his\nappreciation of that elegance was being hampered by the surrounding\ncircumstances.",
      "Then another thought occurred to Harry.",
      "\"Um,\" Harry said. \"You think that this Mirror is a trap for you\n-\"",
      "\"There is no way beneath the heavens that it is not meant as a\ntrap.\"",
      "\"That is to say, it's a trap for Lord Voldemort. Only it can't\nbe a trap for him personally. There has to be a general rule that\nunderlies it, some generalizable quality of Lord Voldemort that\ntriggers it.\" Without conscious awareness, Harry was frowning hard\nat the Mirror's golden back.",
      "\"As you say,\" said Professor Quirrell, who was beginning to\nfrown at Harry's frowning.",
      "\"Well, on the first Thursday of this year, the mad Headmaster\nDumbledore, who I'd just seen incinerate a chicken, told me that I\nhad no chance whatsoever of getting into his forbidden corridor,\nsince I didn't know the spell Alohomora.\"",
      "\"I see,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"Oh, dear. I wish you\nhad thought to mention this to me a good deal earlier.\"",
      "Neither of them needed to state aloud the obvious, that this bit\nof reverse reverse psychology had successfully ensured that Harry\nwould stay the heck away from Dumbledore's forbidden corridor.",
      "Harry was still concentrating. \"Do you think Dumbledore suspects\nthat I am, in his terms, a horcrux of Lord Voldemort, or more\ngenerally, that some aspects of my personality were copied off Lord\nVoldemort?\" Even as Harry asked this aloud, he realized what a dumb\nquestion it was, and how much completely blatant evidence he'd\nalready seen that -",
      "\"Dumbledore cannot possibly have missed it,\" said\nProfessor Quirrell. \"It is not exactly subtle. What else is\nDumbledore to think, that you are an actor in a play whose stupid\nauthor has never met a real eleven-year-old? Only a gibbering\ndullard would believe that - ah, never mind.\"",
      "The two of them stared at the Mirror in silence.",
      "Finally Professor Quirrell sighed. \"I have outwitted myself, I\nfear. Neither you nor I dare be reflected in this Mirror. I suppose\nI must command Professor Sprout to undo my Obliviations of Mr. Nott\nand Miss Greengrass... You see, the other great difficulty of the\nMirror is that the rule by which it treats those reflected will\ndisregard external forces, such as False Memories or a Confundus\nCharm. The Mirror reflects only those forces arising from within\nthe person themselves, the states of mind they arrive at through\ntheir own choices; so it is said in several places. That is why I\nhad Mr. Nott and Miss Greengrass, believing different stories about\nwhy the Stone's extraction was necessary, ready to appear before\nthis Mirror.\" Professor Quirrell rubbed at the bridge of his nose.\n\"I constructed other stories for other students, ready for me to\nset into motion with the chosen trigger... but as this day\napproached, I began to feel pessimistic about the project. Such as\nNott and Greengrass still seem worth trying, if we cannot think of\nsomething better. But I wonder if Dumbledore has tried to construct\nthis puzzle to specifically resist Voldemort's cunning. I wonder if\nhe might have succeeded. If you devise an alternative plan which I\napprove enough to try, I promisse that whatever pawn I ssend\nforth sshall not be harmed by me, then or ever; nor do I expect to\nbreak that promisse. And I remind you again of the hostages I\nhold to my failure, both Miss Granger and all the others.\"",
      "Again they stared at the mirror in silence, the elder Tom Riddle\nand the younger.",
      "\"I suspect, Professor,\" Harry said after a time, \"that your\nentire class of hypotheses about somebody needing to want the Stone\nfor good or honest purposes is mistaken. The Headmaster wouldn't\nset a retrieval rule like that.\"",
      "\"Why?\"",
      "\"Because Dumbledore knows how easy it is to end up believing\nthat you're doing the right thing when you're actually not. It'd be\nthe first possibility he imagined.\"",
      "\"Iss it truth or trickery that I hear?\u202f\"",
      "\"Am being honesst,\" Harry said.",
      "Professor Quirrell nodded. \"Then your point is well taken.\"",
      "\"I'm not sure why you think this puzzle is solvable,\" Harry\nsaid. \"Just set a rule like, your left hand must hold a small blue\npyramid and two large red pyramids, and your right hand must be\nsqueezing mayonnaise onto a hamster -\"",
      "\"No,\" Professor Quirrell said. \"No, I think not. The legends are\nunclear on what rules can be given, but I think it must have\nsomething to do with the Mirror's original intended use - it must\nhave something to do with the deep desires and wishes arising from\nwithin the person. Squeezing mayonnaise onto a hamster will not\nqualify as that, for most people.\"",
      "\"Huh,\" Harry said. \"Maybe the rule is that the person has to not\nwant to use the Stone at all - no, that's too easy, the story you\ngave Mr. Nott solves it.\"",
      "\"In some ways you may understand Dumbledore better than I,\" said\nProfessor Quirrell. \"So now I ask you this: how would Dumbledore\nuse his notion of the acceptance of death to guard this Stone? For\nthat above all he thinks I cannot comprehend, and he is not far\nwrong.\"",
      "Harry thought about this for a while, considering several ideas\nand discarding them. And then, having thought of something, Harry\nconsidered remaining silent... before mapping out the obvious part\nof the future conversation where Professor Quirrell asked him to\nsay in Parseltongue if he'd thought of something.",
      "Reluctantly, Harry spoke. \"Would Dumbledore think that this\nMirror could reach the afterlife? Could he put the Stone into\nsomething that he thinks is an afterlife, so that only\npeople who believe in an afterlife can see it?\"",
      "\"Hm...\" Professor Quirrell said. \"Possibly... yes, there is a\ncertain plausibility to it. Using this setting of the Mirror to\nshow people their heart's desires... Albus Dumbledore would see\nhimself reunited with his family. He would see himself united with\nthem in death, wanting to die himself rather than wishing\nfor them to be returned to life. His brother Aberforth, his sister\nAriana, his parents Kendra and Percival... it would be Aberforth to\nwhom Dumbledore gave the Stone, I think. Would the Mirror recognize\nthat Aberforth particularly had been given the Stone? Or will any\nperson's dead relative do, if that person believes their relative's\nspirit would give them back the Stone?\" Professor Quirrell was\npacing in a short circle, keeping well away from Harry and the\nMirror as he moved. \"But all this is only one idea. Let us devise\nanother.\"",
      "Harry began to tap his cheek, then stopped abruptly as he\nrealized where he'd picked up that gesture. \"What if Perenelle is\nthe one who put the Stone in here? Maybe she keyed the Mirror to\ngive the Stone only to the person who put it in originally.\"",
      "\"Perenelle has lived this long by knowing her limitations,\" said\nProfessor Quirrell. \"She does not overestimate her own intellect,\nshe is not prideful, if that were so she would have lost the Stone\nlong ago. Perenelle will not try to think of a good Mirror-rule\nherself, not when Master Flamel can leave the matter in\nDumbledore's wiser hands... but the rule of only returning the\nStone to the one who remembers placing it, also works if Dumbledore\nhimself has placed the Stone. It would be a hard rule to bypass,\nsince I cannot simply Confund someone into believing that they put\nin the Stone... I would have to create a false Stone, and a false\nMirror, and arrange the drama...\" Professor Quirrell was frowning,\nnow. \"But it is still something that Dumbledore would imagine\nVoldemort being able to arrange, given time. If at all possible,\nDumbledore will want to make the key to the Mirror a state of mind\nhe thinks I cannot arrange in a pawn - or a rule that\nDumbledore thinks Voldemort can never comprehend, such as a rule\ninvolving the acceptance of one's own death. That is why I\nconsidered your previous idea plausible.\"",
      "Then Harry had an idea.",
      "He was not sure if it was a good idea.",
      "...it wasn't like Harry had a lot of choice here.",
      "\"Arguendo,\" Harry said. \"We're not sure what's necessary to\nretrieve the Stone. But a sufficient condition should\ninvolve Albus Dumbledore, or maybe someone else, in a state of mind\nwhere they believe that the Dark Lord has been defeated, that the\nthreat is over, and that it is time to take out the Stone and give\nit back to Nicholas Flamel. We aren't sure which part of that\nperson's state of mind, let's say Dumbledore's, will be the\nnecessary part that he thinks Lord Voldemort can't understand or\nduplicate; but under those conditions Dumbledore's entire state of\nmind will be sufficient.\"",
      "\"Reasonable,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"So?\"",
      "\"The corresponding strategy,\" Harry said carefully, \"is to mimic\nDumbledore's state of mind under those conditions, in as much\ndetail as possible, while standing in front of the mirror. And this\nstate of mind must have been produced by internal forces, not\nexternal ones.\"",
      "\"But how are we to get that without Legilimency or the Confundus\nCharm, both of which would certainly be external - ha. I\nsee.\" Professor Quirrell's ice-pale eyes were suddenly\npiercing. \"You suggest that I Confund myself, as you cast\nthat hex upon yourself during your first day in Battle Magic. So\nthat it is an internal force and not an external one, a state of\nmind that comes about through only my own choices. Say to me\nwhether you have made this suggestion with the intention of\ntrapping me, boy. Say it to me in Parseltongue.\"",
      "\"My mind that you assked to devisse sstrategy may perhapss\nhave been influenced by ssuch an intent - who knowss? Knew you\nwould be ssusspiciouss, assk thiss very question. Decission is up\nto you, teacher. I know nothing you do not know, about whether\nthiss iss likely to trap you. Do not call it betrayal by me if you\nchoosse thiss for yoursself, and it failss.\" Harry felt a\nstrong impulse to smile, and suppressed it.",
      "\"Lovely,\" said Professor Quirrell, who was smiling. \"I\nsuppose there are some threats from an inventive mind that even\nquestioning in Parseltongue cannot neutralize.\"",
      "Harry put on the Cloak of Invisibility, at Professor Quirrell's\norders, to sstop the man who sshall believe himsself to be\nsschoolmasster from sseeing you, as Professor Quirrell said in\nParseltongue.",
      "\"Wearing the Cloak or no, you will stand in range of the Mirror\nyourself,\" Professor Quirrell said. \"If a gush of lava comes forth,\nyou will also burn. I feel that much symmetry should apply.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell pointed to a spot near the right of the door\nthrough which they'd entered the room, before the Mirror and well\nback of it. Harry, wearing the Cloak, went to where Professor\nQuirrell had pointed him, and did not argue. It was increasingly\nunclear to Harry whether both Riddles dying here would be a bad\nthing, even with hundreds of other student hostages at stake. For\nall of Harry's good intentions, he'd mostly shown himself so far to\nbe an idiot, and the returned Lord Voldemort was a threat to the\nentire world.",
      "(Though either way, Harry couldn't see Dumbledore doing the lava\nthing. Dumbledore was probably sufficiently angry at Voldemort to\ndiscard his usual restraint, but lava wouldn't permanently stop an\nentity that Dumbledore believed to be a discorporate soul.)",
      "Then Professor Quirrell pointed with his wand, and a shimmering\ncircle appeared around where Harry was standing on the floor. This,\nProfessor Quirrell said, would soon become a Greater Circle of\nConcealment, by which nothing within that circle could be heard or\nseen from the outside. Harry would not be able to make himself\napparent to the false Dumbledore by taking off the Cloak, nor by\nshouting.",
      "\"You will not cross this circle once it is active,\"\nProfessor Quirrell said. \"That would cause you to touch my magic,\nand while Confunded I might not remember how to halt the resonance\nthat would destroy us both. And further, since I do not want you\nthrowing shoes -\" Professor Quirrell made another gesture, and just\nwithin the Greater Circle of Concealment, a slight shimmer appeared\nin the air, a globe-shaped distortion. \"Thiss barrier will\nexplode if touched, by you or other material thing. The\nresonance might lash at me afterward, but you would also be dead.\nNow tell me in Parseltongue that you do not intend to cross this\ncircle or take off your Cloak or do anything at all\nimpulsive or stupid. Tell you me you will wait quietly here, under\nthe Cloak, until this is over.\"",
      "This Harry repeated back.",
      "Then Professor Quirrell's robes became black tinged with gold,\nsuch robes as Dumbledore might wear upon a formal occasion; and\nProfessor Quirrell pointed his own wand at his head.",
      "Professor Quirrell stayed motionless for a long time, still\nholding his wand to his head. His eyes were closed in\nconcentration.",
      "And then Professor Quirrell said, \"Confundus.\"",
      "At once the expression of the man standing there changed; he\nblinked a few times as though confused, lowering his wand.",
      "A deep weariness spread over the face Professor Quirrell had\nworn; without any visible change his eyes seemed older, the few\nlines in his face calling attention to themselves.",
      "His lips were set in a sad smile.",
      "Without any hurry, the man quietly walked over to the Mirror, as\nthough he had all the time in the world.",
      "He crossed into the Mirror's range of reflection without\nanything happening, and stared into the surface.",
      "What the man might be seeing there, Harry could not tell; to\nHarry it seemed that the flat, perfect surface still reflected the\nroom behind it, like a portal to another place.",
      "\"Ariana,\" breathed the man. \"Mother, father. And you, my\nbrother, it is done.\"",
      "The man stood still, as if listening.",
      "\"Yes, done,\" the man said. \"Voldemort came before this mirror,\nand was trapped by Merlin's method. He is only one more sealed\nhorror now.\"",
      "Again the listening stillness.",
      "\"I would that I could obey you, my brother, but it is better\nthis way.\" The man bowed his head. \"He is denied his death,\nforever; that vengeance is terrible enough.\"",
      "Harry felt a twinge, watching this, a sense that this was\nnot what Dumbledore would have said, it seemed more like a\nstrawman, a shallow stereotype... but then this wasn't the real\nAberforth's spirit either, this was who Professor Quirrell imagined\nDumbledore imagined Aberforth was, and that doubly-reflected image\nof Aberforth wouldn't notice anything amiss...",
      "\"It is time to give back the Philosopher's Stone,\" said the man\nwho thought he was Dumbledore. \"It must go back into Master\nFlamel's keeping, now.\"",
      "Listening stillness.",
      "\"No,\" said the man, \"Master Flamel has kept it safe these many\nyears from all who would seek immortality, and I think it will be\nsafest in his hands... no, Aberforth, I do think his intentions are\ngood.\"",
      "Harry couldn't control the tension that was running through him\nlike a live wire; he was having trouble breathing. Imperfect,\nProfessor Quirrell's Confundus Charm had been imperfect. The\nunderlying personality of Professor Quirrell was leaking through\nand seeing the obvious question, why it was okay for Nicholas\nFlamel himself to have the Stone if immortality was so awful. Even\nif Professor Quirrell conceptualized Dumbledore as being blind to\nthe question, Professor Quirrell hadn't included a clause in the\nConfundus saying that Dumbledore's image of Aberforth\nwouldn't think of it; and all of this was ultimately a reflection\nof Professor Quirrell's own mind, an image from within the\nintelligence of Tom Riddle...",
      "\"Destroy it?\" said the man. \"Maybe. I am not sure it\ncan be destroyed, or Master Flamel would have done it long\nsince. I think, many times, that he has regretted making it...\nAberforth, I promised him, and we are not so ancient or so wise\nourselves. The Philosopher's Stone must go back into the keeping of\nthe one who made it.\"",
      "And Harry's breath stopped.",
      "The man was holding an irregular chunk of scarlet glass in his\nleft hand, the size perhaps of Harry's thumb from fingernail to the\nfirst joint. The sheened surface of the scarlet glass made it seem\nwet; the appearance was of blood, suspended in time and made into a\njagged surface.",
      "\"Thank you, my brother,\" the man said quietly.",
      "Is that what the Stone should look like? Does Professor\nQuirrell know what the true Stone should look like? Will the Mirror\ngive back the real Stone under these conditions, or make an\nimitation and return that?",
      "And then -",
      "\"No, Ariana,\" the man said, smiling gently, \"I fear I must go\nnow. Be patient, my dearest, it will be soon enough that I join you\nin truth... why? Why, I am not sure why I must go... when I hold\nthe Stone I am to step aside from the Mirror and wait for Master\nFlamel to contact me, but I am not sure why I need to step aside\nfrom the Mirror to do that...\" The man sighed. \"Ah, I am getting\nold. It is well this dreadful war ended when it did. I suppose\nthere is no harm if I speak to you for a time, my dearest, if you\nwish it so.\"",
      "A headache was starting behind Harry's eyes; some part of Harry\nwas trying to send a message about not having breathed in a while,\nbut no one was listening. Imperfect, Professor Quirrell's\nConfundus Charm had been imperfect, Professor Quirrell's image of\nDumbledore's image of Ariana wanted to talk to Dumbledore, and\nmaybe didn't want to wait because Professor Quirrell knew on some\nlevel that there wasn't really an afterlife, and the previously\nimplanted impulse to leave after getting the Stone wasn't\nstanding up to Riddle-Ariana's arguments...",
      "And then Harry felt himself become very calm. He started\nbreathing again.",
      "Either way, there wasn't much Harry could do about it. Professor\nQuirrell had stopped Harry from intervening; well, Professor\nQuirrell was welcome to reap the consequences of that decision. If\nthe consequences caught Harry as well, so be it.",
      "The man who thought he was Dumbledore was mostly nodding\npatiently, sometimes replying to his dearest sister. Sometimes the\nman cast an uneasy look to one side; as if feeling a strong impulse\nto go, but suppressing that impulse with the great patience and\npoliteness and concern for his sister that Professor Quirrell\nimagined Albus Dumbledore having.",
      "Harry saw it the instant the Confundus wore off, and the man's\nexpression changed, becoming again the face of Professor\nQuirrell.",
      "And in the same instant the Mirror changed, no longer showing\nHarry the reflection of the room, showing instead the form of the\nreal Albus Dumbledore, as though he were standing just behind the\nMirror and visible through it.",
      "The real Dumbledore's face was set, and grim.",
      "\"Hello, Tom,\" said Albus Dumbledore.",
      "Ch. 110 will post on\nFebruary 24th, 2015 at 12PM Pacific / 8PM\nUTC."

      "The grimness on Albus Dumbledore's face lasted only an instant\nbefore giving way to bewilderment. \"Quirinus? What -\"",
      "And then there was a pause.",
      "\"Well,\" said Albus Dumbledore. \"I do feel stupid.\"",
      "\"I should hope so,\" Professor Quirrell said easily; if he had\nbeen at all shocked himself at being caught, it did not show. A\ncasual wave of his hand changed his robes back to a Professor's\nclothing.",
      "Dumbledore's grimness had returned and redoubled. \"There I am,\nsearching so hard for Voldemort's shade, never noticing that the\nDefense Professor of Hogwarts is a sickly, half-dead victim\npossessed by a spirit far more powerful than himself. I would call\nit senility, if so many others had not missed it as well.\"",
      "\"Quite,\" said Professor Quirrell. He lifted his eyebrows.\n\"Really, am I that hard to recognise without the glowing red\neyes?\"",
      "\"Oh, yes indeed,\" Albus Dumbledore said in level tones. \"Your\nacting was perfect; I confess myself utterly deceived. Quirinus\nQuirrell seemed - what is the term I am looking for? Ah yes, that\nis the word. He seemed sane.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell chuckled; he looked for all the world as\nthough the two of them were just having a casual conversation. \"I\nnever was insane, you know. Lord Voldemort was just another game\nfor me, the same as Professor Quirrell.\"",
      "Albus Dumbledore did not look like he was enjoying a casual\nchat. \"I thought you might say that. I regret to inform you, Tom,\nthat anyone who can bring himself to act the part of Voldemort\nis Voldemort.\"",
      "\"Ah,\" said Professor Quirrell, raising an admonishing finger.\n\"There is a loophole in that reasoning, old man. Anyone who acts\nthe part of Voldemort must be what moralists call 'evil', on this\nwe agree. But perhaps the real me is completely, utterly,\nirredeemably evil in an interestingly different fashion from what I\nwas pretending with Voldemort -\"",
      "\"I find,\" Albus Dumbledore ground out, \"that I do not care.\"",
      "\"Then you must think yourself to be rid of me very soon,\" said\nProfessor Quirrell. \"How interesting. My immortal existence must\ndepend on discovering what trap you have set, and finding a way to\nescape from it, as soon as possible.\" Professor Quirrell paused.\n\"But let us pointlessly delay to talk of other matters first. How\ndid you come to be waiting inside the Mirror? I thought you would\nbe elsewhere.\"",
      "\"I am there,\" Albus Dumbledore said, \"and also inside\nthe Mirror, unfortunately for you. I have always been here, all\nalong.\"",
      "\"Ah,\" said Professor Quirrell, and sighed. \"I suppose my little\ndistraction was for naught, then.\"",
      "And the rage of Albus Dumbledore was no longer leashed.\n\"Distraction?\u202f\" roared Dumbledore, his sapphire eyes tight\nwith fury. \"You killed Master Flamel for a\ndistraction?\u202f\"",
      "Professor Quirrell looked dismayed. \"I am wounded by the\ninjustice of your accusation. I did not kill the one you know as\nFlamel. I simply commanded another to do so.\"",
      "\"How could you? Even you, how could you? He was the library\nof all our lore! Secrets you have forever lost to\nwizardry!\u202f\"",
      "There was an edge to Professor Quirrell's smile, now. \"You know,\nI still do not comprehend how your twisted mind can consider it\nacceptable for Flamel to be immortal, but when I try for the same\nit makes me a monster.\"",
      "\"Master Flamel never descended into immortality! He -\"\nDumbledore choked. \"He only stayed awake past his evening, for our\nsakes, through his long, long day -\"",
      "\"I don't know if you recall this,\" Professor Quirrell said, his\nvoice airy, \"but do you recall that day in your office with Tom\nRiddle? The one where I begged you, where I went down on my knees\nand begged you, to introduce me to Nicholas Flamel so that I could\nask to become his apprentice, to someday make for myself the\nPhilosopher's Stone? That was my last attempt to be a good person,\nif you are curious. You told me no, and gave me a lecture on how\nunvirtuous it was to be afraid of death. I went from your office in\nbitterness and in fury. I reasoned that if I was to be called evil\nin any case, just for not wanting to die, then I might as well be\nevil; and one month later I killed Abigail Myrtle to pursue\nimmortality by other means. Even when I knew more of Flamel, I\nremained quite put out with your hypocrisy; and for that reason I\ntormented you and yours more than I otherwise would have done. I\nhave often felt that you ought to know this, but we never had a\nchance to talk frankly.\"",
      "\"I decline,\" said Albus Dumbledore, whose gaze did not waver. \"I\ndo not accept the tiniest shred of responsibility for what you have\nbecome. That was all, entirely, you and your own decisions.\"",
      "\"I am not surprised to hear you say that,\" said Professor\nQuirrell. \"Well, now I am curious as to what responsibilities you\ndo accept. You have access to some unusual power of Divination;\nthat much I deduced long ago. You made too many nonsensical moves,\nand the paths by which they worked out in your favor were too\nridiculous. So tell me. Were you forewarned of the result, that\nnight of All Hallow's Eve when I was vanquished for a time?\"",
      "\"I knew,\" said Albus Dumbledore, his voice low and cold. \"For\nthat, I accept responsibility, which is something you will never\nunderstand.\"",
      "\"You arranged for Severus Snape to hear the Prophecy that he\nbrought to me.\"",
      "\"I allowed it to happen,\" said Albus Dumbledore.",
      "\"And there I was, all excited at having finally gained my own\nforeknowledge.\" Professor Quirrell shook his head as though in\nsadness. \"So the great hero Dumbledore sacrificed his unwitting\npawns, Lily and James Potter, merely to banish me for a few\nyears.\"",
      "Albus Dumbledore's eyes were like stones. \"James and Lily would\nhave gone willingly to the death, if they had known.\"",
      "\"And the little baby?\" Professor Quirrell said. \"Somehow I doubt\nthe Potters would have been so eager to leave him in the path of\nYou-Know-Who.\"",
      "You could scarcely see the flinch. \"The Boy-Who-Lived came out\nof it well enough. Tried to turn him into you, did you?\nInstead you turned yourself into a corpse, and Harry Potter became\nthe wizard you should have been.\" Now there was something like the\nusual Dumbledore behind the half-moon glasses, a tiny twinkle in\nthose eyes. \"All of Tom Riddle's icy brilliance, tamed to the\nservice of James and Lily's warmth and love. I wonder how you felt\nwhen you saw what Tom Riddle could have become, if he had grown up\nin a loving family?\"",
      "Professor Quirrell's lips quirked. \"I was surprised, even\nshocked, by the abyssal depths of Mr. Potter's naivete.\"",
      "\"I suppose the humor of the situation would be lost on you.\" It\nwas then, finally, that Albus Dumbledore smiled. \"How I laughed\nwhen I realised it! When I saw you had made a Good Voldemort to\noppose the evil one - ah, how I laughed! I never had the steel for\nmy role, but Harry Potter shall be more than equal to it, when he\ncomes into his power.\" Albus Dumbledore's smile disappeared.\n\"Though I suppose Harry shall have to find some other Dark Lord to\nvanquish for it, since you will not be there.\"",
      "\"Ah, yes. That.\" Professor Quirrell made to walk away from the\nMirrror, and seemed to halt just before reaching the point where\nthe Mirror would no longer have reflected him, if it had been\nreflecting him. \"Interesting.\"",
      "Dumbledore's smile was colder, now. \"No, Tom. You are not going\nanywhere.\"",
      "Professor Quirrell nodded. \"What have you done, exactly?\"",
      "\"You have refused death,\" said Dumbledore, \"and if I destroyed\nyour body, your spirit would only wander back, like a dumb animal\nthat cannot understand it is being sent away. So I am sending you\noutside Time, to a frozen instant from which neither I nor any\nother can return you. Perhaps Harry Potter will be able to retrieve\nyou someday, if prophecy speaks true. He may wish to discuss with\nyou just who is at fault for the deaths of his parents. For you it\nwill only be an instant - if you ever return at all. Either way,\nTom, I wish you the best of it.\"",
      "\"Hm,\" said Professor Quirrell. The Defense Professor had paced\npast where Harry stood, watching mute and with something like\nhorror, only to halt again at the other edge of the mirror. \"As I\nsuspected. You are using Merlin's old method of sealing, what the\ntale of Topherius Chang names as the Process of the Timeless. If\nlegend speaks true, not even you can stop the process, now that it\nhas been in motion this long.\"",
      "\"Indeed,\" said Albus Dumbledore. But his eyes were suddenly\nwary.",
      "And Harry, from where he stood just before and to the right of\nthe door, waiting in silence and controlled terror, could feel it\nin the air; he could feel the sense of a presence\ngathering within the Mirror's field. Something more alien than\nmagic, everything about it incomprehensible except for the fact of\nits strangeness and the fact of its power. It had been slow but now\nit was waxing faster, that presence.",
      "\"But you could still reverse the effect, if Chang's account is\ntrue,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"Most powers of the Mirror are\ndouble-sided, according to legend. So you could banish what is on\nthe other side of the Mirror instead. Send yourself, instead of me,\ninto that frozen instant. If you wanted to, that is.\"",
      "\"And why would I do that?\" Albus Dumbledore's voice was tight.\n\"I suppose you are going to tell me that you have taken hostages?\nThat was futile, Tom, you fool! You utter fool!\nYou should have known that I would give you nothing for any\nhostages you had taken.\"",
      "\"You always were one step too slow,\" said Professor Quirrell.\n\"Allow me to introduce you to my hostage.\"",
      "Another presence invaded the air around Harry, a crawling\nsensation all over his flesh as another Tom Riddle's magic passed\nvery close to his skin. The Cloak of Invisibility was torn away\nfrom him, and the shimmering black Cloak flew away from him,\nthrough the air.",
      "Professor Quirrell caught it, and swiftly drew it over himself;\nin less than a second he had pulled down the Cloak's hood over his\nhead, and disappeared.",
      "Albus Dumbledore staggered, as though some essential support had\nbeen removed from him.",
      "\"Harry Potter,\" the Headmaster breathed. \"What are you doing\nhere?\u202f\"",
      "Harry stared at the image of Albus Dumbledore, on whose face\nutter shock and utter dismay were warring.",
      "The guilt and the shame were too much, too much, hitting Harry\nall at once, and he could feel the incomprehensible presence around\nhim rising to a peak. Harry knew without words that there was no\ntime left, and that he was done.",
      "\"It's my fault,\" Harry said in a tiny voice, from whatever part\nof him had taken over his throat in the final extremity. \"I was\nstupid. I've always been stupid. You mustn't rescue me.\nGoodbye.\"",
      "\"Why, look at that,\" sang out Professor Quirrell's voice from\nthe empty air, \"I don't seem to have a reflection any more.\"",
      "\"No,\" said Albus Dumbledore. \"No, no, NO!\u202f\"",
      "Into the hand of the Albus Dumbledore flew from his sleeve his\nlong, dark-grey wand, and in his other hand, as though from\nnowhere, appeared a short rod of dark stone.",
      "Albus Dumbledore threw these both violently aside, just as the\nbuilding sense of power rose to an unbearable peak, and then\ndisappeared.",
      "The Mirror returned to showing the ordinary reflection of a\ngold-lit room of white stone, without any trace of where Albus\nDumbledore had been.",
      "The next update will be on\nFebruary 25th, 2015 at\n10:30am Pacific / 6:30pm\nUTC.",
      "This will be followed by another\nupdate on the same day at 1pm Pacific / 9:00pm\nUTC.",
      "I have some inter-city traveling\nto do tomorrow, involving a train (hence the weird\nschedule).\nPlease do not panic if either update is late."

      "Harry's mind was disarrayed. His eyes kept staring at where\nAlbus Dumbledore had been. There was a horror in him that was too\nhuge for understanding or reflection.

      "\"Ahahahaha! Why, yes, little child, you were always along on\nthis adventure as my hostage, it was your whole purpose in being\nhere. Ha, hahahaha! You are decades too young to play this game\nagainst the real Tom Riddle, child.\" The Dark Lord drew back the\nhood of the Cloak, his head becoming visible, and began to remove\nthe rest of the Cloak. \"And now, boy, you have helped me, yess\nindeed, and so it iss time to ressurrect your girl-child friend. To\nkeep promisse.\" The Dark Lord's smile was cold, cold indeed.\n\"I suppose you have doubts? Mark well, I could kill you this\ninstant, for there is no longer a Headmaster of Hogwarts to be\ninformed of it. Doubt me all you wish, but remember that.\" The hand\nwas once more holding the gun. \"Now come along, foolish child.\"",
      "And they left.",
      "They went back out through the door into the Potions room, the\nDark Lord banishing the returned purple fire with a stroke of his\nwand. They went through the chamber where the boggart had been, and\nthe chamber of ruined chess statues, and through the burned door of\nthe chamber of keys. The Dark Lord floated up through the trapdoor,\nand Harry struggled up afterward through the spiral staircase of\nleaves, the tendrils of the Devil's Snare twitching and then moving\nback as though afraid. The Boy-Who-Lived was trying hard not to\nburst into tears, and his dark-side patterns weren't helping, maybe\nbecause Voldemort had never known or dealt with guilt.",
      "They passed the huge three-headed Inferi, and at a whispered\nword from the Dark Lord it collapsed over the trapdoor and became a\ncorpse again.",
      "They passed Severus Snape standing guard, who told them both\nthat he was guarding the door, and that they must leave or he would\ndeduct House points.",
      "The Dark Lord spoke the words \"Hyakuju montauk\" without\npausing in his stride, accompanied by a jab of his wand; and\nSeverus staggered before he lifelessly drew himself up beside the\ndoor once more.",
      "\"What -\" Harry said, as he followed. \"What did you -\"",
      "\"Just fulfilling my obligation to my faithful servant. It shall\nnot kill him, as I promised you.\" The Dark Lord laughed again.",
      "\"The hostages -\" Harry said. It was hard to keep his voice\nsteady. \"The students, you said you'd stop whatever is going to\nkill them -\"",
      "\"Yess. Sstop worrying. Will do on our way out.\"",
      "\"Out?\"",
      "\"We are leaving, child.\" The Dark Lord was still smiling.",
      "The bad feeling this raised was lost in a sea of other bad\nfeelings.",
      "The Dark Lord was now consulting what he'd called the Hogwarts\nMap, the handwritten lines upon it seeming to move as they walked.\nSome part of Harry's mind that had been considering what to do if\nthey ran into Aurors on patrol (whom the Dark Lord could kill, or\nObliviate, in an instant) gave up that hope as well.",
      "They went down the Grand Staircase to the second floor,\nencountering no one.",
      "The Dark Lord made a turn Harry did not know, and went down\nanother stair-flight. As they descended past one floor and another,\nthe windows stopped and the torches began, they were within the\nSlytherin dungeons now.",
      "Ahead, the form of a person in Hogwarts robes appeared.",
      "The Dark Lord kept walking toward that person.",
      "Harry followed.",
      "A sixth or seventh-year Slytherin was waiting by a section of\nwall that was set with an artistic carving of Salazar Slytherin\nwielding his wand, against what looked like a giant covered in\nicicles. The witch made no comment at seeing Professor Quirrell\nwalking upright, or seeing Harry in his company, or seeing the gun\nin the Defense Professor's hand. If her eyes were blank, Harry\ncouldn't tell the difference.",
      "The Dark Lord reached into his robes, took out a Knut, and\nflipped it to her. \"Klaudia Alicja Tabor, I command you thus. Take\nthis Knut to the spell circle I showed you beneath the Quidditch\nstands and put it in the center. Then Obliviate yourself of the\nlast six hours.\"",
      "\"Yes, lord,\" the witch said, bowing to him, and went on her\nway.",
      "\"I thought -\" Harry said. \"I thought you needed the Stone to\n-\"",
      "The Dark Lord was still smiling, he had never stopped smiling.\n\"I did not say that part in Parseltongue, child. All I said in\nParseltongue was that I had set events in motion to kill students,\nevents that I would stop if I obtained the Stone. The rest was in\nhuman speech. I would also have stopped the Blood Fort sacrifice if\nI had not obtained the Stone, so long as I was not discovered and\nrestrained. The students of Hogwarts are a valuable resource, whom\nI have already spent much time training.\" Then the Dark Lord hissed\nto the wall, \"Open.\"",
      "Harry's eyes saw the tiny snake that had been set in the\nupper-left of the carving, even as the wall slowly swung backward,\nrevealing the opening of a huge pipe. Moss grew on its sides and a\nmusty dusty smell welled up from it; the interior was also covered\nwith cobwebs in multiple sheets.",
      "\"Spiders...\" murmured the Dark Lord. He sighed, and for that\nbrief moment he sounded once more like Professor Quirrell.",
      "The Dark Lord walked into the huge pipe, the cobwebs burning\naway before him. Harry, not seeing any other better options,\nfollowed.",
      "The pipe branched in a Y-shape, then branched again. The Dark\nLord went left, then right.",
      "The pipe came to a solid metal wall. \"Open,\" the Dark\nLord hissed, and a crack appeared in the metal; it seemed to fold\ninto itself.",
      "Beyond was the middle of a long, stone tunnel.",
      "\"We shall be walking a while,\" said the Dark Lord. \"Did you have\nmore questions to ask, little child?\"",
      "\"I - I can't think of any - right now -\"",
      "Another cold laugh replied to this, and they walked into the\ntunnel, turning right.",
      "Harry didn't know, then or ever, how long he walked; the light\nof burning spiderwebs was too dim to read his mechanical watch, and\nHarry had not thought to look at the time before entering. It felt\nlike they walked for miles, miles beneath the ground.",
      "Slowly, Harry's mind tried to recover itself a final time. Very\npossibly final, if he was right about the Dark Lord killing him\nafter this... though the Dark Lord had said that he would resurrect\nHermione, which seemed pointless if that was true... was that\nsimply the Dark Lord following through on a promise he would not\notherwise have been able to make in Parseltongue... why had he not\njust shot Harry on the spot...",
      "Seriously, some last functioning part of his brain said\nto all the other parts, this would be a good time to think of\nsomething, something that the Dark Lord has not already thought of,\nsomething we can do without our pouch or our wand or our\nTime-Turner, something that Professor Quirrell has not imagined we\ncan do... think, think, pretty pretty please think of something?\nDon't shut down now, even if you're scared, even if we've never\nreally really faced death before in the sense of being about to die\nin the next hour, THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO SHUT DOWN -",
      "Harry's mind stayed blank.",
      "Suppose, said that last remaining part, suppose we\ntry to condition on the fact that we win this, or at least get out\nof this alive. If someone TOLD YOU AS A FACT that you had survived,\nor even won, somehow made everything turn out okay, what would you\nthink had happened -",
      "Not legitimate procedure, whispered Ravenclaw, the\nuniverse doesn't work like that, we're just going to die.",
      "Someone realises we're missing, thought Hufflepuff,\nand Mad-Eye Moody shows up with a squad of Aurors and rescues\nus. I think the time has come to admit we're not more competent\nthan the standard authorities.",
      "The saving factor does have to be something we do\nsomehow, said the last voice. Otherwise there's no\npoint in our thinking about it.",
      "Problem two, said Gryffindor. Harry Potter isn't\nmissing, he's right there at the Quidditch match where everyone can\nsee him. Professor Quirrell thought of that too, it's part of why\nhe sent that fake note. Problem three. I don't think Mad-Eye Moody\nand an Auror squad can beat the Dark Lord, and certainly not before\nhe kills us. I'm not sure the entire DMLE can beat the Dark Lord if\nhe's fighting seriously and Dumbledore is gone. Problem four. The\nQuidditch match was not disrupted, that's probably the only reason\nwhy Professor Quirrell was willing to try something as complicated\nas bringing us along on this trip in the first place.",
      "Thinking along different lines, ventured Slytherin,\nmaybe Professor Quirrell calls in someone else to Memory-Charm\nus. Legilimency, Imperius, Confundus, who knows what else,\nwe're not a perfect Occlumens. Then the Dark Lord would have a\nsmart - well, sort-of smart lieutenant that he could use. That\ncould be another reason why Professor Quirrell was so willing to\ntell us secrets, if he knew that the memory would disappear. It's\nalso a reason to leave the Hogwarts wards, so the Dark Lord can\ncall Bellatrix to Apparate in and do the work...",
      "This entire reasoning process is illegitimate and I refuse\nto participate, said Ravenclaw.",
      "What lovely last words, said the last voice. Now\nshut up and think.",
      "Rough stone tunnel went by underfoot, Harry's shoes sometimes\ndipping into moisture or nearly slipping on a curved surface. The\nneurons in his brain, which kept on firing, imagined voices talking\nto each other, yelling at each other, even as the Listener stayed\nnumb with horror and shame.",
      "Gryffindor and Hufflepuff were conducting a debate about suicide\nby charging the Dark Lord's gun, or by swallowing the little jewel\non Harry's steel ring. It seemed unclear whether the fate of the\nworld was better or worse if the Dark Lord had Harry as a\nmind-slave; if the Dark Lord was going to win anyway, it might be\nbetter if he won faster.",
      "And the last voice kept talking through it all; even in the\ndepths of failure that last voice remained. What else did the\nDark Lord always say in human speech and never in Parseltongue? Do\nwe remember? Anything like that, anything at all?",
      "It was all too distant in time, too distant in time even though\nit had all happened this very day. The Dark Lord had told him in\nParseltongue just now that it was time to revive Hermione, and then\nhe'd said other things all in English, Harry could hardly remember\nfor all that they'd just been spoken. Before then... before then\nthere'd been the Circle of Concealment, when Professor Quirrell had\nhissed that the barrier would explode if touched. And the Defense\nProfessor had said in English for Harry not to take off his Cloak\nor try crossing the Circle, said in English that the resonance\nmight strike Professor Quirrell afterwards but Harry would be dead.\nSaid in English that if Harry touched the magic and Professor\nQuirrell didn't remember how to halt the resonance, it would kill\nthem both...",
      "Suppose it doesn't kill us both, said the last voice.\nOn Halloween in Godric's Hollow, the Dark Lord's body was\nburned and we only ended up with a scar on our forehead. Suppose\nthe resonance between us is deadlier to the Dark Lord than to us.\nWhat if this entire time we've been able to kill the Dark Lord at\nany time, just by dashing forward and touching our hands to any\npart of his exposed skin? And then it makes our scar bleed again,\nbut that's all. The sense of 'stop, don't do that' is inherited\nfrom the Dark Lord's worst memory of his mistake in Godric's\nHollow, it may not actually apply to the Boy-Who-Lived.",
      "A small note of hope rose.",
      "Rose, and was quashed.",
      "The Dark Lord can just throw away his wand, droned\nRavenclaw. Professor Quirrell can turn into his Animagus form.\nEven if he dies the Dark Lord will possess someone else and return,\nand then torture our parents, to punish us.",
      "We might be able to get to our parents in time, said\nthe last voice. We might be able to hide them. We might be able\nto get the Philosopher's Stone away from the Dark Lord if we killed\nhis current body now, and that Stone could provide the nucleus of a\ncounter-army.",
      "The Dark Lord was moving on through the stony corridor. His hand\nstill held the gun. He was at least four meters away from\nHarry.",
      "If we dart forward, he will sense us approaching through the\nresonance, said Hufflepuff. He will fly forward rapidly,\nhe can do that, he has the broomstick-enchantments that let him\nfly. He will fly forward, turn around, and fire the gun. He knows\nabout the resonance, he's thought of this already. This is not\nsomething the Dark Lord has failed to consider. He will be ready\nfor it, and waiting.",
      "Continuing the same line of argument, said the last\nvoice. Suppose we can freely cast magic on Professor Quirrell\nbut he can't cast it on us.",
      "Why would that be true? demanded Ravenclaw. In\nfact, we have evidence that it's false. In Azkaban, when\nProfessor Quirrell's Avada Kedavra hit our Patronus Charm, it felt\nlike our head was splitting apart -",
      "Suppose that was all his magic going out of\ncontrol. Suppose if we'd just cast, say, a Luminos targeting him,\nnothing bad would have happened.",
      "But why? said Ravenclaw. Why suppose that?",
      "Because, thought Harry, it explains why Professor\nQuirrell didn't warn me not to cast any magic on him in\nAzkaban. Because Professor Quirrell never said in Parseltongue,\nthat I can remember, that I'd hurt myself if I tried to cast magic\non him. He could have given me that warning, but he didn't, even\nthough he gave me a lot of other warnings. Absence of evidence is\nweak evidence of absence.",
      "There was a pause while Harry's parts considered this.",
      "We don't actually have our wand, said Ravenclaw.",
      "We might get it back at some point, thought the last\nvoice.",
      "But even then, Harry thought, and the grey hopelessness\nreturned, the resonance is something the Dark Lord knows about.\nHe's already thought of everything I can do with that, he already\nhas a response prepared. That was my mistake from the beginning. I\ndidn't respect the Dark Lord's intelligence, I didn't think that\nmaybe he knew everything I knew and could see everything I saw and\nhad already taken it into account.",
      "Then, said the last voice, conditional on our\nwinning, we must have hit him with something he doesn't know\nabout.",
      "Dementors, offered Gryffindor.",
      "The Dark Lord knows we can destroy, deflect, and\npossibly control Dementors, said Ravenclaw. He doesn't\nknow how, but he knows we have the capability, and where the heck\nwould we get a Dementor anyway?",
      "Maybe, ventured Hufflepuff, the Dark Lord's whole horcrux\nsystem would short out via the resonance if we grabbed him and held\nhim, sacrificing our own life to destroy him forever.",
      "Bullhockey, said Ravenclaw. But I guess it doesn't\nhurt to engage in some pleasant fantasy before we die, no matter\nhow stupid.",
      "If Lord Voldemort had a strong enough fear of death,\nHufflepuff argued, if he wanted strongly enough to\njust not need to think about death again, then the horcrux\nsystem could have design flaws like that. It never\noccurred to Voldemort to test his horcruxes on someone else, that\ncould indicate he wasn't able to think about the subject clearly\n-",
      "So his fear of death is his fatal weakness? said\nRavenclaw. Yeah, no. I'm thinking someone with over a hundred\nhorcruxes might have a few failsafe mechanisms in there.",
      "And Harry's brain went on thinking.",
      "A genuine asymmetry in the magical resonance between them...\nseemed improbable, there was no reason for the magical effect to\nwork like that. But the magical backlash could hit the stronger\nwizard harder, the more powerful magic resonating more dangerously.\nThat could explain the observed event in Godric's Hollow (Voldemort\nexplodes, baby survives), and also explain the observed event in\nAzkaban (Voldemort severely impaired by backlash of his strong\nmagic, first-year Boy-Who-Lived hit by lighter backlash of his weak\nmagic). Or if it was only the caster's magic that resonated, that\ncould also explain both those two observations. That might even\nexplain why Professor Quirrell had been in no rush to warn Harry\nagainst casting any magic on him. Though there was another obvious\nreason why Professor Quirrell would avoid raising the subject of\nthe resonance; it was a gigantic hint about the mystery of Godric's\nHollow, if Harry had ever made the connection.",
      "The part that was numb with grief and guilt took this\nopportunity to observe, speaking of obliviousness, that after\nevents at Hogwarts had turned serious, they really really\nreally REALLY should have reconsidered the decision made\non First Thursday, at the behest of Professor McGonagall, not\nto tell Dumbledore about the sense of doom that Harry got around\nProfessor Quirrell. It was true that Harry hadn't been sure\nwho to trust, there was a long stretch where it had seemed\nplausible that Dumbledore was the bad guy and Professor Quirrell\nthe heroic opposition, but...",
      "Dumbledore would have realised.",
      "Dumbledore would have realised instantly.",
      "The wise old wizard with the true phoenix on his shoulder would\nhave known, and Harry hadn't trusted him, Harry hadn't told him all\nthe relevant facts, and the reason for this had been sheer neglect\nto reconsider a cached decision made four days into the start of\nthe school year. It had been marked 'something not to tell\nDumbledore' and even after Azkaban, even after Hermione died, even\nafter everything, Harry had simply forgot to promote the question\nto deliberation and reconsider the tradeoff.",
      "Another wave of grief and shame washed over Harry, and for a\ntime he walked on in the silence of the last voice, other voices\nbeing happy enough to fill the gap.",
      "After what was at least several miles, and many grey thoughts,\nthe stone tunnel ended.",
      "The Dark Lord climbed up stone steps, and Harry followed\nafter.",
      "The two of them came into a dark, dank stone building. Dirty old\nstone doors swung open without being touched.",
      "Before them lay marble slabs, rising up from bare ground, upon\nthem names and dates. The tombstones were scattered in nothing like\nneat rows, and the rest of the graveyard ran wild.",
      "The moon above was over three-quarters full, already seeming\nbright with night not fully fallen.",
      "Harry had stopped walking upon seeing the graveyard. There was a\nblaring alarm in his brain saying to be anywhere other than\nhere, but there weren't any options for accomplishing that. So\nthat alarm cried unanswered, even as behind Harry the stone doors\nof the mausoleum swung shut again and sealed themselves.",
      "The Dark Lord came into the center of the scattered graveyard.\nHe stopped walking, and waved his wand above his head in a small\ncircle.",
      "There was a rumbling sound, and smoothly from the ground rose an\naltar, at least two meters wide and of black stone carved with grey\nsigils. And then surrounding the altar groaned up six dark-marble\nobelisks, regularly spaced, gleaming darkly beneath the fading\ntwilight sky.",
      "The unanswerable alarm in Harry's brain grew louder.",
      "\"This,\" said the Dark Lord in Professor Quirrell's cadences, \"is\na workspace I made for myself, convenient to either Hogwarts or\nHogsmeade.\" The Dark Lord flourished a hand at the altar. \"That is\nwhere Miss Granger shall revive, and also where I shall be reborn\ninto my true body. I shall remake myself first, of course.\nMagicss to revive girl-child eassier with true body.\" A\nstrange snakish laughter accompanied these words. \"Resst\nasssured that though ssome asspects of girl-child'ss ressurrection\nsshall be what otherss conssider Dark, girl-child will not be\nharmed or made ugly by it. Sshall sstill look like hersself, mind\nsshall be her own, nor sshall I or mine harm her after.\"",
      "Harry's tongue was dry and his mind was having trouble\nfunctioning. \"Please, Professor, would you say in Parseltongue what\nis your real purpose in resurrecting Miss Granger?\"",
      "\"To resstore to you girl-child friend'ss counssel and\nresstraint. To make ssure sshe iss part of the world for you to\ncare about. That, boy, iss truly the greater part of the reasson I\nam doing thiss deed.\" Again snakish laughter accompanied these\nwords, conveying sardonic awareness of some vast irony.",
      "A small spark of hope kindled inside Harry, alongside the much\ngreater note of confusion, and the fear that a perfect Occlumens\ncould indeed lie in Parseltongue. Harry didn't understand why the\nDark Lord was doing this, if the next step was just to kill the\nBoy-Who-Lived or enslave him...",
      "Maybe he'd just never understood Professor Quirrell at all,\nmaybe somehow Harry's model of Tom Riddle was just that\nwrong... maybe the Boy-Who-Lived would be Obliviated of the\nlast day and dropped off somewhere with a confused Hermione\nGranger, while Lord Voldemort went on to conquer the world...?",
      "Hope flared up in Harry, but it was a confused hope that didn't\nmake any sense. It didn't square with the Dark Lord who had mocked\nDumbledore and laughed at his defeat. Harry couldn't come up with\nany consistent account of Professor Quirrell's motives that allowed\nfor something like that.",
      "I do not know what is meant to happen next.",
      "The Dark Lord had moved forward to the altar. He knelt there,\nand seemed to reach deep into the stone of the altar itself,\ndrawing forth a vial of liquid that looked black in the fading\ntwilight.",
      "When the Dark Lord spoke again his voice was clipped and\nprecise. \"Blood, blood, blood so wisely hidden,\" said the Dark\nLord.",
      "And the obelisks surrounding the altar began to speak, voices\nlike a chanting chorus coming from the motionless stones, cadances\nolder than Latin.",
      "Apokatastethi, apokatastethi, apokatastethi to soma mou\nemoi.",
      "Apokatastethi, apokatastethi, apokatastethi to soma mou\nemoi.",
      "The obelisks' chant echoed after the end of each line, as if\nthey were speaking out of synchrony with each other. The blood was\npoured from the vial, and it seemed to catch and hang over the\naltar, slowly expanding through the air, taking on a shape.",
      "Apokatastethi, apokatastethi, apokatastethi to soma mou emoi\n(emoi).",
      "Apokatastethi, apokatastethi, apokatastethi to soma mou emoi\n(emoi).",
      "A tall form rested upon the altar, and even in the dimming\ntwilight it looked too pale.",
      "The Defense Professor reached his hand into his robe, and drew\nforth a small irregular chunk of red glass.",
      "He placed that upon the tall pale body.",
      "The Stone stayed there for a time, minutes at least. The\nirregular chunk of red glass did not glow, or flash, or give any\nother indication of power.",
      "Then the Stone moved, just a little, turning slightly upon the\nbody.",
      "The Defense Professor took back the Stone into his robes, and\nprodded the tall form that lay motionless upon the altar, touching\nthe eyes with his fingers, poking the chest with his wand.",
      "He threw back his head, then, and laughed.",
      "\"Incredible,\" said the Dark Lord, in the voice of the Defense\nProfessor that Harry had known. \"Fixed, it is fixed in form! A mere\nconstruct sustained by magic, become the true substance at the\nStone's touch! And yet I sensed nothing! Nothing! I feared I had\nbeen deceived, that I had obtained a false Stone, but the substance\nproves true to my every test!\" The Defense Professor tucked the red\nglass back into his robes. \"That is eldritch even by my standards,\nI admit.\"",
      "Then the Defense Professor walked around the altar, five times\nhe walked around it, chanting something too low for Harry to\nhear.",
      "The Dark Lord placed his wand in the hand of the figure lying on\nthe altar.",
      "He placed his hands, both of them, over the body's forehead.",
      "The Dark Lord spoke. \"Fal. Tor. Pan.\"",
      "Without any warning there was a flash like lightning that lit up\nthe entire graveyard, and Harry staggered back a step, his hands\ninvoluntarily going to his forehead. It felt as if he had been shot\nthere, or a wasp stung him, upon his scar.",
      "The Defense Professor collapsed.",
      "And the too-tall figure sat up upon the altar.",
      "It swung around smoothly, and stood tall upon the ground, at\nleast a head higher than a normal man. The form's limbs were lean\nand pale, little-muscled but giving an impression of terrible\nstrength.",
      "Harry took another staggering step back, his hands still clasped\nto his scar. Though the distance between them was wide, Harry felt\na sense of terrifying apprehension in the air, as though the sense\nof doom had always been been out of focus and had now\nclarified, concentrated into a physical pain in the scar on Harry's\nforehead.",
      "Was that what Voldemort was supposed to look like? The\nnose looked like, it looked like it had malfunctioned\nduring the resurrection process -",
      "The too-tall figure threw back his head and laughed, raising his\nhands and wand to look at them. The left hand opened wide and it\nwas like a pale half-spider with four over-long legs, fingers\ncaressing the wand held in the other hand. Leaves stirred up from\nthe graveyard, approaching to dance around the too-tall figure,\nsurrounding him and clothing him, reforming into a high-necked\nshirt and flowing robes; and Lord Voldemort was laughing. Exactly\nthe mirthless laughter that Harry remembered coming from his own\nthroat inside the Dementor's nightmare, precise in tone and\ntimbre.",
      "Red eyes gleamed beneath the fading twilight, their pupils\nslitted like a cat's.",
      "The form that Voldemort had abandoned raised itself, quivering,\nfrom the ground; and in a voice that Harry could barely hear,\nQuirinus Quirrell gasped, \"Free - oh, free -\"",
      "\"Stupefy,\" said the high cold voice of Voldemort, and\nQuirinus Quirrell was blasted down into the ground; then, with a\nwave of Voldemort's other hand, Quirinus Quirrell was picked up and\nflung away from the altar.",
      "Voldemort walked away from the altar, then turned and looked at\nHarry; and the pain in Harry's scar flared at it.",
      "\"Frightened, child?\" Voldemort hissed, like there was an\nundercurrent of Parseltongue even to the Dark Lord's human speech.\n\"Good. Place the girl on the altar, and break your Transfiguration.\nIss time for me to revive her.\"",
      "Is this really going to happen? Are we really going to do\nthis?",
      "Harry swallowed, mastering his fear through that note of\nimpossible hope amid the confusion, and walked over to the altar.\nThen Harry took off his left shoe, and his left sock, and took off\nthe toe-ring that was Hermione Granger, the Transfigured shape\nidentical to the toe-ring that had been given Harry as an emergency\nportkey. There was a twinge of regret in Harry for not having the\nreal portkey now, but only a twinge; an inner-circle Death Eater\nwould routinely put up boundaries against portkeys, if Severus had\nbeen right. Behind Harry, Voldemort laughed again in what sounded\nlike surprised appreciation.",
      "\"I need my wand to Finite her,\" Harry said aloud.",
      "\"You do not.\" High the voice and cruel. \"You learned to\nsustain a Transfiguration by touch alone, without further use of\nthe wand. You can likewise break your own Transfiguration\nwandlessly, by commanding your sustaining magic to drain away. Do\nso now.\"",
      "Harry swallowed, and touched the toe-ring. He had to try three\ntimes, and clear his mind, before he could push his magic out of\nthe toe-ring, as before he had learned to make a tiny stream of\nmagic flow in.",
      "The breaking of the spell went much more slowly that way than a\nFinite Incantatem, almost like the sped-up reverse of\nwatching something being Transfigured. The toe-ring distorted,\nflowing together, expanding. Colors changed, textures changed.",
      "Two-thirds of a dead girl lay strewn across the altar, on her\nside with one arm falling off the altar's edge, the position in\nwhich the reversion had chanced to place her. No blood flowed now\nfrom the chewed stumps of her thighs. The dead girl wore Hermione\nGranger's face, but twisted and pale. It was as Harry had seen\nbefore in the hospital's back room, the image burned into his brain\nduring thirty long minutes of Transfiguration, the image he had\nreproduced during four even longer hours to Transfigure the decoy.\nThe dead girl was naked, for her clothes were not part of her, and\nhad not been Transfigured.",
      "The sight brought back flashbacks, of the hours spent in the\ninfirmary room, of the nightmares afterward, all of which Harry\nsuppressed.",
      "\"Go back,\" said Voldemort's high voice. \"This is my work,\nnow.\"",
      "Harry swallowed, and retreated from the altar, to the mouth of\nthe long corridor where he'd stood before. \"Her body is, should be,\naround five Celsius, I cooled her so, so there wouldn't be brain\ndamage -\" Harry's own voice was wavering in pitch. Is he really\ngoing to do this? Really? There had to be a catch and Harry\njust couldn't see it. Voldemort had said that neither he nor any of\nhis would harm Hermione, that her body and mind would be her own -\nwhy?",
      "Voldemort walked forth to the altar once more, orienting the\nbody before him with a wave of his hand to lie straight across the\naltar. The Dark Lord spoke with high monotone precision, \"Flesh,\nflesh, flesh so wisely hidden.\"",
      "The obelisks began chanting once more.",
      "Apokatastethi, apokatastethi, apokatastethi to soma hou emoi\n(emoi).",
      "Apokatastethi, apokatastethi, apokatastethi to soma hou emoi\n(emoi).",
      "New flesh flowed out of the stumps of the girl's thighs,\ncreeping forward like an ooze and solidifying.",
      "The obelisks ceased chanting. A complete form lay naked upon the\naltar.",
      "It didn't look like Hermione. A Hermione Granger should be\nstanding up and talking, she should have her Hogwarts uniform.",
      "Voldemort raised a hand, then hissed, as though in annoyance.\nWith a violent gesture, the robes around Quirinus Quirrell's\nsleeping from were torn in half, his purple-and-green tie shredded,\nand his suit-jacket drawn from him to where Voldemort stood. Some\npart of Harry flinched, as if seeing the Dark Lord Voldemort\nattacking Professor Quirrell.",
      "Voldemort plunged his hand deliberately into the suit jacket,\nwhich jerked as though something were being broken; then Voldemort\nshook out the suit jacket onto the ground beside him, emptying out\nthe contents. Harry's pouch fell from it, and his Time-Turner, and\na broomstick, and Voldemort's gun, and the Cloak, and a number of\namulets and rings and stranger devices that Harry did not\nrecognize.",
      "And finally a chunk of red glass, which was laid upon Hermione\nGranger's form, and allowed to stay there for a time.",
      "Minutes passed. The Dark Lord donned an amulet from the heap of\nthings beside the altar; also from the heap, Voldemort took four\nshort wooden rods with straps upon them, and reached beneath his\nrobes to attach them, it looked like they went on his upper arms\nand upper thighs. The Dark Lord rose into the air, moved left,\nright, up and down, seeming to wobble slightly at first; then his\nflight stabilized.",
      "The chunk of red glass turned, slightly.",
      "The Dark Lord Voldemort floated to the ground, and prodded\nHermione Granger's body with his wand.",
      "\"There iss an obsstacle,\" hissed Voldemort.",
      "In Harry's mind the expectation of betrayal or other failure had\nalready been so strong that the confirmation came only as a dull\nshock, not a sharp one. \"What obsstacle?\u202f\"",
      "\"Girl'ss body iss resstored. Ssubstance iss repaired. But\nnot magic, or life... thiss iss body of dead Muggle.\"\nVoldemort turned from the altar, began to pace. \"The full ritual\nwould solve this. But that would require time... time and the blood\nof Granger's enemy, and I do not think Draco Malfoy still\nqualifies, nor can I take my own blood unwillingly... foolish.\"\nVoldemort's voice was a lower hiss. \"Foolish, I should have\nforeseen this, and prepared. Her brain might awaken with an\nelectrical shock, I know that much of Muggle medicine... but would\nher magic return to her? That I do not know, and I suspect if she\nawakens as a Muggle she will be a Muggle forever. Still, I can\nthink of nothing better.\" The Dark Lord raised his wand -",
      "\"Wait!\" Harry blurted, feeling hope return. She needs a\nspark of life and magic, just a spark to get her\nstarted...",
      "Voldemort turned and looked at him. The snakelike face showed\nsome slight degree of surprise.",
      "\"Think I have ssomething that might work,\" Harry\nhissed. \"Needss wand. Have no intentionss to usse it againsst\nyou.\" Harry said nothing about expecting his intentions\nwouldn't change; he'd simply blurted out the idea fast enough that\nhe hadn't formed any specific intentions yet.",
      "\"This,\" Voldemort hissed, \"I desire to see.\" The Dark Lord\nreached into the heap of things by the altar, and picked up the\nwrapped form of Harry's wand. It was thrown, gliding through the\nair and then dropping at Harry's feet; and then the Dark Lord\nfloated back, the heap of things moving smoothly backwards with\nhim.",
      "Harry unwrapped his wand, and moved forward.",
      "We have our wand back, that's step one, said the last\nvoice, the voice of hope.",
      "No part of Harry had any idea what step two might be, but it was\nstill step one accomplished.",
      "And Harry stood before the reformed body of Hermione Granger,\nwho was still naked and dead, on a twilight-lit stone altar.",
      "\"Lord Voldemort,\" Harry said, \"I beg you, please give her some\nclothes. It might help me do this.\"",
      "\"Granted,\" hissed Voldemort. The pain in Harry's scar flared as\nthe naked girl's body lifted into the air, then flared again as\ndead leaves danced around her and she was clothed in the seeming of\na Hogwarts uniform, though the trim was red instead of blue.\nHermione Granger's hands folded over her chest, her legs\nstraightened, and her body drifted back down.",
      "Harry looked at her.",
      "Focused on her, now that she looked human again.",
      "She looks like she is sleeping, not dead. It took a\nconscious effort to look for breathing, fail to see it, and make\nthe deduction. So far as naked perception was concerned... Hermione\nmight as well be alive, right now.",
      "That Hermione Granger would not approve of this situation, taken\nas a whole, seemed beyond question. But it didn't mean that she\nwould rather stay dead than be alive, other things being equal,\nthough they might not be.",
      "Because you wish to live, because my best guess is that you\nwould wish to live...",
      "Harry reached out his shaking left hand, and touched Hermione's\nforehead. It was warm now, not the chill of five degrees Celsius;\neither Voldemort had increased her body temperature to normal, or\nthe magic of the ritual had done it automatically. Which meant that\nHermione's brain was currently warm and without oxygen, come to\nthink.",
      "That did it, the sense of urgency rising in him.",
      "Harry's feet assumed the stance, his wand swung up to point at\nHermione Granger's dead body. The only thing wrong with\nHermione's body was that it was dead; everything else about that\nbody was right, only one thing needed changing.",
      "You don't belong here, death.",
      "\"Expecto,\" Harry shouted, feeling the magic and the\nlife rise up into the Patronus Charm that was fueled by both,\n\"PATRONUM!\u202f\"",
      "The girl in the Hogwarts uniform was surrounded by a blazing\naura of silver fire, as the Patronus was born inside her.",
      "Harry staggered, as he felt a dip, a bite. Intuition or\nTom Riddle's memory told Harry that the life and magic that had\njust flowed into Hermione would never return to him, either one. It\nhadn't been all his life or all his magic, not by a long shot,\nthere hadn't been time to expend that much, but whatever\nhe'd just expended was gone forever.",
      "And Hermione Granger was breathing, just like she was sleeping,\nrhythmic inhalations and exhalations. The twilight sky had dimmed\nfurther, and Harry could not see if color was returning to her, but\nit should have been, it certainly should have been. She looked to\nbe sleeping peacefully, and it wasn't because being dead looked\nlike sleeping, it was because she was asleep and her body was fine\nand nothing was hurting her while she slept.",
      "Some part of Harry, that had somehow managed not to speak up\nearlier, quietly pointed out that they were still in a graveyard,\nthe recently victorious Lord Voldemort was still in control of the\nsituation, and that his guess about Hermione wanting to be alive\nwas just a guess.",
      "Harry was still smiling, as he slowly lowered his wand. The\ncelebratory fireworks going off inside his mind were restrained,\nHarry wasn't screaming and running around in little circles like\nProfessor Flitwick, but that -",
      "That -",
      "THAT, Harry said aloud inside his mind, THAT is\nwhat I call Step Two.",
      "\"Interesting,\" said the cold high voice. \"Your Patronus draws\nupon your life as well as your magic... I guessed that much, for it\nwas too powerful for a first-year to fuel with magic alone. And yet\nthere must be more to the puzzle, since not just any life-fueled\nspell would have done... was your happy thought the image of her\nreturning to life? Was that all it took?\" Lord Voldemort was again\ntoying with his wand, a dark interest in those red-slitted eyes. \"I\nsuspect I will feel quite stupid when I finally comprehend that\nspell, someday in my eternity. Now step away from the girl.\nThere iss more work I intend to do, to give her besst chance of\ncontinued life.\"",
      "Harry stepped back, reluctantly, the sense of tension starting\nto return to him. He almost tripped over one haphazard grave\nmarker, as the Dark Lord continued to walk forward.",
      "Standing before the altar, the Dark Lord laid one finger upon\nHermione Granger's forehead.",
      "Then the Dark Lord tapped his finger upon Hermione Granger's\nforehead, and said, in a voice so low Harry almost did not hear,\n\"Requiescus.\"",
      "Voldemort waved his hand at an obelisk, which began to rotate,\nturning itself to lay flat upon the ground, pointing outward.\n\"Fascinating indeed,\" Voldemort hissed. \"She is alive, and magical,\nand not another Tom Riddle as I feared you might have made\nher.\"",
      "The tension was rising again in Harry. He'd put his wand away\ninto the back belt of his pants, he did not want to remind\nVoldemort that he still had the wand on him. \"What are you doing to\nher now?\"",
      "Another obelisk turned, lay flat upon the ground. \"There iss\nold, losst ritual to ssacrifice magical creature, transsfer magical\nnature to ssubject. Limitationss are great. Transsfer iss\ntemporary, only few hourss. Ssubject ssometimess diess when\ntranssfer wearss off. But Sstone will make permanent.\"",
      "Four obelisks lay flat upon the ground, evenly spaced; the other\ntwo obelisks had been floated away.",
      "Voldemort began to reach into his own mouth, checked himself,\nhissed with annoyance again. He gestured at the sleeping mouth of\nQuirinus Quirrell, and from Quirrell's mouth floated up two teeth,\nalmost invisible in the falling night. One of these went to the\npile of items, the other floated to before the altar.",
      "Moments later, Harry cried out and took a step back.",
      "Huge and misshapen, lumpy skin, legs thick as tree-trunks, a\nsmall head that looked like a coconut perched upon a boulder.",
      "A mountain troll stood within the circle of obelisks, motionless\nas though asleep while standing.",
      "\"What are you doing?\u202f\"",
      "Voldemort's mouth was stretched in a wide smile; it looked\nhorrible on him, like his face had too many teeth.\n\"Sshall ssacrifice my fallback weapon, and girl-child sshall\ngain troll'ss power of regeneration. Transsfiguration ssicknesss\niss nothing before that, if perchance it wass not fixed by\npreviouss ritual. And no knife sshall sslay girl-child, nor cutting\ncursse, nor ssicknesss take her.\"",
      "\"Why - why are you doing this?\" Harry's voice shook.",
      "\"Have not the tiniesst intention of letting girl-child die\nagain, after going to ssuch lengthss to ressurrect her.\"",
      "Harry swallowed. \"I'm very confused.\" Was Voldemort\npracticing being nice? This hypothesis did not seem like a\nsufficient explanation.",
      "\"Stay well back,\" Voldemort said coldly. \"This ritual is Darker\nthan the last.\" The Dark Lord began a new chant, softer syllables\nthat seemed to seethe through the air like living things; and\nHarry, feeling a new surge of apprehension, stepped backwards.",
      "Then Harry cried aloud, as pain flared again within his scar.\nThe mountain troll crumbled in on itself, becoming ashes hanging in\nthe air, then dust, and then the dust seemed to blow away without\ngoing anywhere; it was gone.",
      "Hermione Granger slept on peacefully, whatever spell of repose\nVoldemort had cast on her being sufficient to the task.",
      "\"Um,\" Harry said in a small voice. \"Did it work?\"",
      "\"Diffindo.\"",
      "Harry stepped forward with a choked yell, and then halted, both\nas the stupidity of his motion caught up with him, and as the\nsudden cut that the Severing Charm had opened on Hermione's leg\nclosed almost as quickly as it had been made. In seconds there was\nonly a light stain of blood on the surrounding flesh.",
      "The Stone was laid again on Hermione, and after a time it\nturned. Voldemort laughed once more, as he passed his hand over\nher. \"Marvelous.\"",
      "Then another tiny tooth was floating within the circle of\nobelisks; and an instant later, a unicorn stood where the troll had\nstood before, eyes dull and head lowered.",
      "\"What?\" Harry said. \"Why a unicorn?\u202f\"",
      "\"Power of unicorn'ss blood to presserve life makess\nexcellent combination with troll'ss healing. Only Fiendfyre and\nKilling Cursse sshall girl-child fear, from thiss day.\" A\nflicker of snakish laughter. \"Bessidess, had sspare unicorn\nleft over, might ass well usse.\"",
      "\"Unicorn's blood has side effects-\"",
      "\"That iss only when power of unicorn'ss blood iss sstolen by\nanother. Thiss sspell will make power of unicorn belong insside\ngirl-child, ass if sshe wass alwayss born that way.\"",
      "The grim chant and its seething words began again.",
      "Harry watched, not understanding in the slightest.",
      "Forget understanding, what am I seeing?",
      "I'm seeing the Dark Lord Voldemort going to enormous lengths\nto resurrect Hermione Granger and keep her alive. It's like he\nthinks that his own life depends on Hermione Granger being alive,\nsomehow.",
      "The confused parts of Harry looked around for a procedure to\nfollow. 'Make a prediction based on your best current hypothesis'\nwas the first thought that came to mind, but it didn't seem to lead\nanywhere. The plot of the story wasn't going how it ought to, after\nthe villain had won.",
      "Again the blaze of pain in his scar, like a blow to Harry's\nforehead. The unicorn swayed, and then disintegrated as the troll\nhad done.",
      "The Dark Lord laid the Stone upon Hermione's form once more,\nclasping her hands around it.",
      "Voldemort watched the unremarkable process for a time, then\nturned while the Stone still laid on her, making a high humming\nsound in his throat. \"Ah, yes,\" hissed Voldemort. \"That would be\nmost appropriate. Do you still have the diary I gave you, boy? The\ndiary of the famous scientist?\"",
      "Harry's brain took a moment to place what Voldemort was talking\nabout. It had been in Mary's Room, in Mary's Place, in October,\nthat precious gift from a friend. The thought should have triggered\na wave of awful sadness, for the Professor Quirrell that had been\nlost or never real; but there had been enough of that emotion\nalready, and his brain had set it aside for now.",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry said aloud. \"I think it's in my pouch, can I\ncheck?\" Harry knew it was in the pouch. He'd loaded it up\nwith everything that he might possibly conceivably need, that he\nowned or had bought; everything that could have been a quest\nitem.",
      "From the heap of items by the altar, Harry's mokeskin pouch was\ndrawn out, tossed to Harry's feet.",
      "\"Roger Bacon's diary,\" Harry said as he reached in a hand, and\nthe diary appeared. Professor Quirrell had said that the diary\nwould emerge unscathed from a fire, so Harry threw it toward\nVoldemort's altar. Harry did not wince; there were more important\nthings to worry about than polite treatment of books, even that\none.",
      "Voldemort picked up the diary, examining it, appearing quite\nabsorbed.",
      "Harry, as quietly and unobtrusively as he could, attached the\npouch to his belt loop in back, where it wouldn't be visible, near\nwhere Harry had put his wand.",
      "Step three, the pouch.",
      "\"Yes,\" Voldemort hissed as he flipped pages of the diary, \"this\nwill do quite well.\" The Stone moved slightly, and the Dark Lord's\nother hand stored the Stone again within his robes.",
      "\"What was your hidden purpose behind the diary?\" Harry said when\nthe pouch was attached to his belt, and he'd put both of his empty\nhands where Voldemort could see them again. \"I tried translating a\nlittle at the beginning, but it was going slowly -\" Actually, it\nhad been excruciatingly slow and Harry had found other\npriorities.",
      "\"Diary wass exactly what it sseemed, a gift meant to sseduce\nyou to my sside.\" Voldemort made intricate gestures in the air\nwith his wand, not even looking at what his hand was doing, as he\nheld the diary in his other hand. For a moment Harry thought he\ncould see a trail of darkness in the air, but the moonlight was too\nfaint for certainty. \"And now, my dear boy,\" Voldemort's high voice\nwas laced with grim amusement, as his wand briefly tapped Hermione\nGranger's forehead with a casual gesture, \"I make this diary into a\nfar more precious gift, a sign of how much wisdom I have learned\nfrom you. For I would never want you to be deprived of Hermione\nGranger's counsel and restraint, not ever while the stars yet live.\nAvadakedavra.\"",
      "The green bolt of the Killing Curse blazed out faster than Harry\ncould possibly have cast the Patronus Charm, faster than he could\npossibly have moved, it was already over even as Harry cried out\nand went for his wand.",
      "Quirinus Quirrell's unconscious body did not even jerk, in\ndeath. The green light struck into it without other sign.",
      "Darkness glowed in the air, anti-light in the trails that\nVoldemort had made before, and the Diary of Roger Bacon darkened as\nthough corruption were creeping over it, even as a shiver appeared\nin the air around Hermione Granger's form.",
      "The pain in Harry's scar flared overwhelmingly, like a brand\ndriven into his forehead, it sent Harry dodging unthinkingly to one\nside as Tom Riddle's reflexes took over.",
      "And Voldemort was also screaming, shrieking as he dropped the\ndiary to the ground, holding his own head and screaming.",
      "Chance -",
      "The last voice of hope said that, as Harry tried frantically to\nthink, to understand. There wasn't any point in trying to\nkill Voldemort now, it might only annoy him, weapons\ncouldn't kill him while any of his hundreds of horcruxes remained\n-",
      "But it still seemed worth it to temporarily discarnate\nVoldemort, take the Stone and Hermione and run.",
      "Harry's right hand had already taken his wand. His left hand\nwent around to his back, reached awkwardly into his pouch, began to\nmake a silent sign, three English letters.",
      "\"No!\" cried Voldemort. He'd dropped his hands from his head, was\nstaring at Hermione's body as though bewildered. \"No, no!\"",
      "The item came up from Harry's pouch into his hand, and Harry\nbegan to step forward as smoothly as he could, diminishing the\nrange between them to what his brief trials had shown was\ndoable.",
      "\"My great creation -\" gasped Voldemort. His voice was high,\nsounding panicked. \"Two different spirits cannot exist in the same\nworld - it is gone, it is severed! A horcrux, I must make a horcrux\nat once -\" Voldemort's gaze fell on Hermione Granger's\nstill-sleeping form, and he began to raise his wand in the air,\nexecuting the same gestures as before.",
      "Harry raised his gun and pulled the trigger three times.",
      "The next chapter will\npost in 2.5 hours, at 1PM Pacific / 9PM\nUTC.I'll be on a train, though, so don't\npanic if it's a little late."

      "Even as Harry had raised the gun, he'd known he was\nmaking a mistake, his forebrain saw it and tried to stop his hand,\nbut somehow the sick certainty didn't propagate fast enough to\nprevent his finger from pulling the trigger -",
      "The echo of the shots died away within the graveyard.",
      "A fraction of a second before Harry had pulled the trigger,\nVoldemort had jabbed his wand downward, and a wide wall of dirt had\nshot up between them from the graveyard earth, intercepting all\nthree bullets.",
      "An instant after that, pain flared in Harry's scar, a crawling\nfeeling came close to his skin; and then Harry's pouch, clothes,\ngun, everything except his wand disappeared, leaving him naked but\nfor the wand still in his right hand, and the glasses he'd Charmed\nto stick to his nose. The steel ring upon his left pinky finger was\nyanked off hard enough to scrape skin, taking the Transfigured\njewel with it.",
      "\"That,\" said the voice of Voldemort from behind the dirt wall,\n\"was absolutely predictable. Do you really think I would\nshout it aloud for you to hear, if my immortality were disrupted?\nReally, stupid child? Lower your wand, do not raise it up again at\nany time, or you die upon the spot.\"",
      "Harry swallowed, and pointed his wand downward. \"You would have\nbeen disappointed in me,\" Harry said, his own voice now unusually\nhigh, \"if I'd missed an opportunity like that, I mean.\" There was\nno time to think, and Harry's mouth was operating on autopilot for\ntrying to placate evil overlords that might have paternal feelings\nfor you and whom you'd just failed to assassinate.",
      "Voldemort stepped around from behind the dirt wall, smiling that\nhorrible smile that seemed to contain too many teeth. \"I promised\nnot to raise my hand or wand against you, child, if you did not\nraise your hand or wand against me.\"",
      "\"I used bullets,\" Harry said, his voice still high. \"That's not\na fist or a spell.\"",
      "\"My curse thinks differently. That is the puzzle piece that you\nmissed. Did you think I would leave the peace between us to mere\nfortune? Before I created you, I invoked a curse upon myself and\nall other Tom Riddles who would descend from me. A curse to enforce\nthat none of us would threaten the others' immortality, so long as\nthe other made no attempt upon our own. Typical of that ridiculous\nfiasco, the curse seems to have ended up binding me, but taking no\nhold upon the infant with his self so lost.\" A low, lethal chuckle.\n\"But you tried to end my true life jusst then, sstupid child.\nNow cursse iss lifted, and I may kill you any time I\nwissh.\"",
      "\"I see,\" Harry said. He did see; that was why Voldemort\nhad told him about his horcrux system in the first place, just to\nset up the moment when Harry knowingly tried to violate his\nimmortality. Harry's mind was frantically churning through options,\nnone of which seemed helpful. His pouch, his clothes, Harry saw by\nthe moonlight that they all now lay in another heap by the altar,\nout of reach. \"And now you kill me?\" Harry still had his wand,\npresumably the Dark Lord couldn't cast his own magic on that, or\nhis glasses, because of the disharmony. Cast my own spell\nfirst? No, Voldemort just jabs his wand downward to make another\nshield, then shoots me - what else is there? WHAT ELSE?",
      "\"Still a fool. If no further matters remained between us, I\nwould already have killed you.\" The dirt wall crumbled at another\ngesture of the wand, and Voldemort moved smoothly back toward the\nheap of items by the altar. The Dark Lord stretched out a hand, and\nthe diary of Roger Bacon flew to him. \"Thiss iss, indeed,\nhorcrux of girl-child, my ssuperior verssion.\" In his other\nhand appeared a parchment. \"Thiss iss ritual for ressurrecting\nher, if it musst be done again. Insstructionss are honesst, no\ntrapss. Remember that girl-child'ss sspirit cannot float free like\nghosst, Ressurrection Sstone iss my horcrux, not herss. Do not\nlosse her horcrux, or her sspirit may be trapped within it.\"\nVoldemort reached down, picked up Harry's pouch, fed both the diary\nand the parchment into it. \"Remember that, in casse something\ngoess wrong with next movess.\"",
      "\"I don't understand what is happening,\" Harry said. There was\nnothing else left. \"Please explain to me.\"",
      "The Dark Lord was now regarding Harry with a grim look.\n\"When girl-child died, wass in company of sschool'ss Sseer,\nheard prophecy sspoken that you would become force of vasst\ndesstruction. You would become threat beyond imagination, beyond\napocalypsse. That iss why I went to ssuch lengthss to undo my\nkilling of girl-child, keep it undone.\"",
      "\"Are,\" what \"are you sure,\" what.",
      "\"Dare not ssay sspecificss to you. Prophecy I heard of\nmysself led me to fulfill it. Have not forgotten that\ndissasster.\" Voldemort backed further away from Harry, red\nslitted eyes fixed upon the Boy-Who-Lived, gun unwavering in the\nleft hand. \"All thiss, all I have done, iss to ssmassh that\ndesstiny at every point of intervention. If ssome fate makess me\nfail in what comess next, idiot-child of foretold desstruction,\nthen you musst kill yoursself to ssave girl-child. Elsse all you\nclaim to value diess by your own hand.\"",
      "\"I,\" Harry's voice went up an octave, \"I,\" another octave, \"I\nreally really wouldn't do that, seriously!\"",
      "\"Ssilence, fool. Remain ssilent unlesss given leave by me to\nsspeak. Keep your wand pointed down and do not raisse it unlesss\ntold. Elsse you die upon the sspot, and mark that I ssaid that in\nParsseltongue.\" Voldemort reached into the altar again.",
      "For a second Harry's mind couldn't process what he was seeing,\nand then he saw that Voldemort was holding a human arm, severed\nnear the shoulder; it seemed too thin, that arm.",
      "The Dark Lord pressed his wand to the flesh above the severed\narm's elbow, and the fingers twitched, twitched like they were\nalive; by dim moonlight Harry saw a darker mark appear on that\nflesh, just above the elbow.",
      "Seconds later the first hooded figure appeared inside the\ngraveyard with the popping sound of an Apparition. A moment after\nthat came another pop, and then another.",
      "The hooded figures wore silver skull masks, and moonlight fled\nfrom the robes beneath them.",
      "\"Master!\" cried one of the black robes, the third to arrive. The\nvoice was of peculiar timbre, from behind the silver skull mask.\n\"Master - it has been so long - we had lost hope -\"",
      "\"Silence!\" shouted the high voice of the Dark Lord Voldemort.\nEvery trace of Professor Quirrell was now gone from the too-tall\nfigure. \"Train your wand upon the Boy-Who-Lived, and watch him! Do\nnot be distracted, not by anything! Stun him at once if he moves,\nif he begins to speak!\"",
      "More pops. Between graves, behind a tree, in all the shadowy\nspaces, more black robes were Apparating, all hooded and masked.\nSome of them voiced exclamations of joy, many of those sounding\nrather forced; others moved forwards as though to greet their\nMaster. Voldemort gave them all the same instruction, except that\nsome were commanded to Cruciate Harry Potter if he moved, others to\nrestrain the Boy-Who-Lived if he moved, others told to fire hexes\nand curses, others told to cancel his magic.",
      "Thirty-seven pops, Harry counted before the black robes and\nskull masks seemed to stop arriving.",
      "All of them were now holding their wands pointed at Harry,\naligned in a semicircle before him, where they wouldn't get into\neach other's lines of fire.",
      "Harry continued pointing his wand downward, insofar as he had\nbeen told that, if he tried to raise it, he would die. He remained\nsilent, insofar as he had been told that if he tried to speak, he\nwould die. He tried not to shiver in the falling night\ntemperatures, for he was naked, and it was getting colder.",
      "You know, said the last voice within Harry, the voice\nof hope, I think this is getting pretty bad even by my\nstandards.",
      "The next chapter will post on\nFebruary 28th, 2015 at 12PM Pacific / 8PM\nUTC."

      "The gibbous moon riding higher in the cloudless sky, the stars\nand wash of the Milky Way visible in all their majesty within the\ndarkness: All these illuminated thirty-seven skull masks gleaming\nabove black robes, and the darker-clad Lord Voldemort, whose eyes\nshone red.",
      "\"Welcome, my Death Eaters,\" spoke Lord Voldemort's voice, smooth\nand high and terrible. \"No, do not look at me, you fools! Eyes upon\nthe Potter child! Ten years, it has been, ten years since we last\nmet. Yet you answer my call as though it were yesterday...\" The\nDark Lord Voldemort came near to one hooded figure, tapped fingers\nupon the mask. \"In a hastily Transfigured mockery of a\nDeath Eater's true armor, with a childish Charm to distort your\nvoice. Explain, Mr. Honor.\"",
      "\"Our old masks and robes...\" said the robe whose mask the Dark\nLord had tapped. Even through the distorting timbre of the mask,\nthe fear in it was audible. \"We... we were not fighting in them,\nMaster, with you gone... so I did not maintain their\nenchantments... and then you summoned me to appear here, masked,\nand I... I always held faith in you, Master, but I did not know you\nwould return this very day... I am truly sorry to have displeased\nyou...\"",
      "\"Enough.\" The Dark Lord moved on to stand behind another figure,\nthat seemed to tremble, though it kept its mask facing the\nBoy-Who-Lived, and its wand held level. \"I might think more kindly\nof such neglect, if you had pursued my agenda by other means... Mr.\nCounsel. Yet I return to find - what? A country conquered in my\nname?\" The high voice climbed higher. \"No! I find you playing\nordinary politics in the Wizengamot! I find your brothers still\nabandoned in Azkaban! It is a disappointment to me... I confess\nmyself disappointed... You thought I was gone, the Dark Mark dead,\nand you forsook my purpose. Is that right, Mr. Counsel?\"",
      "\"No, Master!\" cried that masked figure. \"We knew you would\nreturn - but, but we could not fight Dumbledore without you -\"",
      "\"Crucio.\"",
      "A horrible scream tore out of the mask, piercing the night, it\ncontinued for long, long seconds.",
      "\"Get up,\" the Dark Lord said to the figure that had collapsed\nupon the ground. \"Keep your wand on Harry Potter. Do not lie to\nme again.\"",
      "\"Yes, Master,\" sobbed the figure, as it pushed itself to its\nfeet.",
      "Voldemort resumed pacing behind the black-robed figures. \"I\nsuppose you are also wondering what Harry Potter is doing here...\nWhy he is a guest at my rebirthing party.\"",
      "\"I know, Master!\" said one of the robes. \"You mean to prove your\npower by killing him, in front of us all, to leave no doubt as to\nwhich of you is stronger! To show how your Killing Curse can slay\neven this so-called Boy-Who-Lived!\"",
      "There was a pause. None of the cloaked figures dared to\nspeak.",
      "Slowly, the Dark Lord Voldemort, in his high-collared shirt and\ndark robes, turned to face the Death Eater who had spoken.",
      "\"That,\" whispered Voldemort in a voice chill as death, \"is a\nlittle too much folly for me to credit, Mr. Sallow. You heard that\ntheory of how I died, and tried to provoke me into repeating a\nmistake?\" Lord Voldemort was floating, rising high off the ground.\n\"I suppose you came to prefer your laziness to my mastery,\nMacnair?\u202f\"",
      "The Death Eater who'd spoken was suddenly surrounded by a blue\nhaze. He spun, slashed his wand at the Dark Lord, and cried\n\"Avada Kedavra!\u202f\"",
      "Voldemort simply tilted to one side in midair, dodging the green\nbolt.",
      "\"Avada Kedavra!\u202f\" cried the Death Eater. His hand that\ndidn't hold a wand was making other gestures, further colors and\nlayers building up in his shielding haze with each gesture\ncompleted. \"Help me, my brothers! If we all -\"",
      "The Death Eater fell in seven flaming pieces to the ground,\nchunks of flesh with the cauterized edges still glowing.",
      "\"Eyes and wands on Harry Potter, all of you,\" Voldemort\nrepeated, his voice low and dangerous. \"And Macnair acted in sheer\nstupidity just then, for I command your Marks, as I always\nshall. I am immortal.\"",
      "\"Master,\" said another robe. \"The girl upon the altar - is she\nto serve us for a Dark Revel? She seems unworthy of such a joyous\noccasion. I could find better, Master, if you give me leave for\njust a short time -\"",
      "\"No, Mr. Friendly,\" said Voldemort, sounding rather amused. \"The\nlittle witch you see upon the altar is none other than Hermione\nGranger -\"",
      "\"What?\" cried one of the black robes, and then, \"I'm sorry,\nMaster, I'm sorry, I beg your -\"",
      "\"Crucio.\" This screaming only lasted a few seconds, and\nVoldemort had performed it as though it were perfunctory. Afterward\nVoldemort's voice returned to low amusement. \"I have resurrected\nthis mudblood through the Darkest of magics, for my own purposes.\nYou shall not offer her the slightest trouble, any of you. You are\nbetter off dead than if I learn my little experiment came to harm\nat your hands. This order is absolute, regardless of other\ncircumstances - even if she escapes, let us say.\" A cold high\nlaugh, as if at some joke that nobody else understood.",
      "\"Master,\" one of the robes said in a faltering voice distorted\nby his skull mask. \"Master, please - I would never defy you, I am\nobedient as you see - but Master, I beg you, let me return, the\nbetter to serve you later - I came here in haste, forsaking -\nMaster, with so many of us being gone, others will wonder, they\nwill mark the absences, who has disappeared. Soon there shall be no\nalibi I can offer.\"",
      "A cold high laugh. \"Ah, Mr. White, the most delinquent of my\nservants. I have not yet decided if you will survive your\npunishment. I have less need of you than I once did, Mr. White. In\ntwo days' time the Death Eaters shall walk openly. My powers have\nincreased, and I have just this day disposed of Dumbledore.\" More\ngasps of shock arose from the Death Eaters, Voldemort paid them no\nheed. \"Tomorrow I shall slay Bones, Crouch, Moody, and Scrimgeour,\nif they have not fled. The rest of you shall go into the Ministry\nand the Wizengamot, and cast Imperius Curses as I direct you. We\nare finished waiting. By tomorrow's nightfall I shall have\ndeclared myself Lord Ruler of Britain!\"",
      "Intakes of breath rose from the gathered masks, but one figure\nwas laughing.",
      "\"You find me amusing, Mr. Grim?\"",
      "\"Apologies, Master,\" said the robed figure who had laughed, his\nwand perfectly level upon where Harry stood. \"I was glad to hear\nyou had dispatched Dumbledore. I fled from Britain in cowardly fear\nof him, having lost faith in your return.\"",
      "Voldemort's chuckle resounded within the graveyard. \"Your candor\nearns you my mercy, Mr. Grim. I was surprised to see you here\ntonight; you are more competent than I suspected. But before we\nturn our attention to happier matters, there is a certain affair to\nwhich we must attend. Tell me, Mr. Grim, if the Boy-Who-Lived swore\nan oath to you, might you trust him?\"",
      "\"Master... I don't understand...\" said Mr. Grim. One or two of\nthe other Death Eaters turned their masks toward Voldemort before\nquickly fixing the skull gaze on Harry.",
      "\"Answer me,\" Voldemort hissed. \"This is not a trick, Mr. Grim,\nand you will answer truthfully or bear the consequences.\nYou knew the boy's forebears, did you not? Knew them for\nstraightforward folk? If the boy freely chose to swear to you an\noath, even knowing you for a Death Eater, might you trust in his\nwords? Answer me!\" Voldemort's voice rose to a shriek.",
      "\"I... yes, Master, I suppose I might...\"",
      "\"Good,\" Voldemort said coldly. \"The potential for trust must\nexist, to be sacrificed. And for the bonder of the Unbreakable\nVow... which of you shall sacrifice their magic? It shall be quite\nthe long Vow... much longer than usual... much magic shall be\nrequired for that...\" Voldemort smiled his awful smile. \"Mr. White\nshall do.\"",
      "\"No, please! Master, I beg you! I served you better\nthan any - as best I could -\"",
      "\"Crucio,\" said Voldemort, and Mr. White screamed\nthrough his mask's distortion for what seemed like a full minute.\n\"Be grateful if I leave you your life! Now approach the boy, Mr.\nGrim, Mr. White. From behind him, idiot! You must not block the\nothers' wands! And the rest of you, you must fire if Harry Potter\ntries to run, even if it means striking at your fellow Death\nEaters.\"",
      "Mr. White took time to approach, the black robes seeming to\nshake, even as Mr. Grim moved smoothly into position.",
      "\"What is to be the Vow, Master?\" came the voice of Mr. Grim.",
      "\"Ah, yes,\" Voldemort said. The Dark Lord went on pacing behind\nthe semicircle of Death Eaters. \"Today - though I hardly expect\neven you to believe me - today we are doing Merlin's work, my Death\nEaters. Yes! Before us stands a great danger, who in his blundering\nfolly has been prophesied to wreak destruction such as even I can\nscarcely imagine. The Boy-Who-Lived! The boy who frightens\nDementors! The cattle who believe they own this world\nshould have been more worried when they saw that. Useless, all of\nthem!\"",
      "\"Forgive me -\" said one black robe in a halting voice. \"Master -\nsurely, if that is so - Master, why don't we just kill him right\naway?\"",
      "Voldemort laughed, a strange bitter laugh. When he spoke on his\nhigh voice was precise. \"Here is the oath's intent, Mr. Grim, Mr.\nWhite, Harry Potter. Listen well and comprehend the Vow that must\nbe sworn, for its intent is also binding, and you three must share\nan understanding of its meaning. You will swear, Harry Potter, not\nto destroy the world, to take no risks when it comes to not\ndestroying the world. This Vow may not force you into any\npositive action, on account of that, this Vow does not force your\nhand to any stupidity. Do you understand that, Mr. Grim, Mr. White?\nWe are dealing with a prophecy of destruction. A prophecy!\nThey can fulfill themselves in twisted ways. We must be cautious\nthat this Vow itself does not bring that prophecy about. We dare\nnot let this Vow force Harry Potter to stand idly after some\ndisaster is already set in motion by his hand, because he must take\nsome lesser risk if he tries to stop it. Nor must the Vow force him\nto choose a risk of truly vast destruction, over a certainty of\nlesser destruction. But all Harry Potter's foolishness,\"\nVoldemort's voice climbed, \"all his recklessness, all his\ngrandiose schemes and good intentions - he shall\nnot risk them leading to disaster! He shall not gamble with the\nEarth's fate! No researches that might lead to catastrophe! No\nunbinding of seals, no opening of gates!\" Voldemort's voice lowered\nagain. \"Unless this very Vow itself is somehow leading into the\ndestruction of the world, in which case, Harry Potter, you must\nignore it in that particular regard. You will not trust\nyourself alone in making such a determination, you must confide\nhonestly and fully in your trusted friend, and see if that one\nagrees. Such is this Vow's meaning and intent. It forces only such\nacts as Harry Potter might choose himself, having learned that he\nis a prophesied instrument of destruction. For the capacity for\nchoice must also exist, to be sacrificed. Do you understand, Mr.\nWhite?\"",
      "\"I - I think so - oh, Master, please, do not let the\nVow be so long -\"",
      "\"Silence, fool, you do a more useful thing this day than you\nhave ever done. Mr. Grim?\"",
      "\"I think, Master, that it must be repeated to me.\"",
      "Voldemort smiled that too-wide smile, and said it all again\nusing different words.",
      "\"And now,\" Voldemort said coldly, \"Harry Potter, you will keep\nyour wand low, and permit Mr. Grim to touch his wand to yours; and\nyou will speak such words as I direct you. If Harry Potter speaks\nany other word, then cut him down, the rest of you.\"",
      "\"Yes, Master,\" came the thirty-four-fold chorus.",
      "Harry was chilled, and shivering, and not only because he was\nnaked in the night. He didn't understand why Voldemort was\nnot just killing him. There seemed to be only a single\nline leading into the future, and it was Voldemort's chosen line,\nand Harry did not know what came after this.",
      "\"Mr. White,\" said Voldemort. \"Touch your wand to Harry Potter's\nhand, and repeat these words. Magic that flows in me, bind this\nVow.\"",
      "Mr. White spoke those words. Even through the distortion effect\nof his mask, it sounded as though his heart were breaking.",
      "Behind Voldemort the obelisks chanted, a language that Harry did\nnot know; three times they repeated their words, then fell\nsilent.",
      "\"Mr. Grim,\" said Voldemort. \"Think of the reasons why you might\ntrust this boy, if he had given this oath freely. Think of that\npotential for trust, and sacrifice it as you say...\"",
      "\"By my trust that I hold for you,\" said Mr. Grim, \"be you\nheld.\"",
      "And then it was Harry Potter's turn to repeat Lord Voldemort's\nwords, and Harry did so.",
      "\"I vow...\" Harry said. His voice shook, but he spoke. \"That I\nshall not... by any act of mine... destroy the world... I shall\ntake no chances... in not destroying the world... if my hand is\nforced... I may take the course... of lesser destruction over\ngreater destruction... unless it seems to me that this Vow\nitself... leads to the world's end... and the friend... in whom I\nhave confided honestly... agrees that this is so. By my own free\nwill...\" Harry could feel it, as the rite was invoked, the shining\ncords of power wrapping around his wand and Mr. Grim's wand,\nwrapping around his hand where Mr. White's wand touched it,\nwrapping around his self on some disturbingly abstract\nlevel. Harry could feel himself invoking his power of free\nchoice, and he knew that his next words would sacrifice\nit, that this was absolutely the last chance to turn back.",
      "\"...so shall it be,\" said the coldly precise voice of Lord\nVoldemort.",
      "\"...so shall it be,\" Harry repeated, and he knew in that moment\nthat the content of the Vow was no longer something he could decide\nwhether or not to do, it was simply the way in which his body and\nmind would move. It was not a vow he could break even by\nsacrificing his life in the process. Like water flowing downhill or\na calculator summing numbers, it was just a\nthing-Harry-Potter-would-do.",
      "\"Did the Vow take, Mr. White?\"",
      "Mr. White sounded like he was weeping. \"Yes, Master... I have\nlost so much, please, I have been punished enough.\"",
      "\"Return to your places...\" said Voldemort. \"Good. All eyes on\nthe Potter child, prepare to fire the instant he tries to flee, or\nraise his wand, or speak any word...\" The Dark Lord floated high in\nthe air, the black-clad figure overlooking the graveyard. Again he\nheld a gun in his left hand, and his wand in his right. \"Better.\nNow we shall kill the Boy-Who-Lived.\"",
      "Mr. White staggered. Mr. Grim was laughing again, and so were\nothers.",
      "\"I did not do that to be funny,\" Voldemort said coldly. \"We are\ndealing with a prophecy, fools. We are snipping the\nthreads of destiny one by one; carefully, carefully, not knowing\nwhen we may first encounter resistance. This is the order in which\nthe next acts shall be done. First Harry Potter shall be stunned,\nthen his limbs severed and the wounds cauterized. Mr. Friendly and\nMr. Honor will examine him for any trace of unusual magics. One of\nyou shall shoot the boy many times with my Muggle weapon, and then\nas many of you as can shall strike him with the Killing Curse. Only\nthen will Mr. Grim crush his skull and brains with the mundane\nsubstance of a tombstone. I shall verify his corpse, then his\ncorpse shall be burned with Fiendfyre, then we will exorcise the\nsurrounding area in case he has left a ghost. I myself will guard\nthis place until six hours have passed, for I do not fully trust\nthe wards I have set against Time's looping; and four of you shall\nsearch the surroundings for signs of anything noteworthy. Even\nafter that we must remain vigilant for any sign of Harry Potter's\nrenewed presence, in case Dumbledore has left some unimagined trick\nin play. If you can think of any trick that I have missed in being\nsure that Harry Potter's threat is ended, speak now and I shall\nreward you handsomely... speak now, in Merlin's name!\"",
      "There was stunned silence amid the cemetery; no one made to\nspeak.",
      "\"Useless, the lot of you,\" Voldemort said with bitter scorn.\n\"Now I shall ask Harry Potter one final question, and he is to\nanswer that question for my ears alone, in Parseltongue. Strike the\nboy down at once if he answers with anything but hisses, if he\ntries to speak one word of human speech.\" Then Voldemort hissed,\n\"Power I know not, it wass ssaid that you would have. The\nMuggle Artss I have now learned of from you, and I am already\nsstudying them. Your power over life-eaterss musst be comprehended\nfor onesself, or sso you ssay. If there iss any other power you\nposssesss, that I may come to have, tell me of it now. Elsse, I\nintend to torment certain of thosse you care for. Ssome livess I\nhave already promissed you, but otherss I did not. Your mudblood\nsservantss in your little army. Your preciouss parentss. All sshall\nssuffer for what will sseem to them like eternitiess; and then I\nsshall ssend them, broken, into the life-eater prisson to remember\nit, until they wasste and die. For each unknown power you tell me\nhow to masster, or other ssecret you tell me that I desire to know,\nyou may name one more of thosse to insstead be protected and\nhonored under my reign. Thiss alsso I promisse and intend to\nkeep.\" Voldemort's smiling expression now came through as if\nit were a snake's gaping fangs, and the meaning that expression\nbore among snakes, a promise that whoever beheld the teeth was to\nbe consumed by them. \"Wasste not time in thoughtss of esscape,\nif you care for thosse oness. You have ssixty ssecondss to begin\ntelling me ssomething I wissh to know, and then your death\nbeginss.\"",
      "This is your final exam.",
      "You have 60 hours.",
      "Your solution must at least allow\nHarry to evade immediate death,\ndespite being naked, holding only his wand, facing 36 Death\nEaters\nplus the fully resurrected Lord Voldemort.",
      "If a viable solution is\nposted before\n*12:01AM Pacific Time* (8:01AM UTC) on Tuesday, March\n3rd, 2015,\nthe story will continue to Ch. 121.",
      "Otherwise you will get a\nshorter and sadder ending.",
      "Keep in mind the\nfollowing:",
      "1. Harry must succeed via his own\nefforts. The cavalry is not coming.\nEveryone who might want to help Harry thinks he is at a Quidditch\ngame.",
      "2. Harry may only use\ncapabilities the story has already shown him to have;\nhe cannot develop wordless wandless Legilimency in the next 60\nseconds.",
      "3. Voldemort is evil and cannot\nbe persuaded to be good;\nthe Dark Lord's utility function cannot be changed by talking\nto him.",
      "4. If Harry raises his wand or\nspeaks in anything except Parseltongue,\nthe Death Eaters will fire on him immediately.",
      "5. If the simplest timeline is\notherwise one where Harry dies -\nif Harry cannot reach his Time-Turner without Time-Turned help\n-\nthen the Time-Turner will not come into play.",
      "6. It is impossible to tell lies\nin Parseltongue.",
      "Within these\nconstraints,\nHarry is allowed to attain his full potential as a\nrationalist,\nnow in this moment or never,\nregardless of his previous flaws.",
      "Of course 'the rational\nsolution',\nif you are using the word 'rational' correctly,\nis just a needlessly fancy way of saying 'the best\nsolution'\nor 'the solution I like' or 'the solution I think we should\nuse',\nand you should usually say one of the latter instead.\n(We only need the word 'rational' to talk about ways of\nthinking,\nconsidered apart from any particular solutions.)",
      "And by Vinge's\nPrinciple,\nif you know exactly what a smart mind would do,\nyou must be at least that smart yourself.\nAsking someone \"What would an optimal player think is the best\nmove?\"\nshould produce answers no better than \"What do you think is\nbest?\"",
      "So what I mean in\npractice,\nwhen I say Harry is allowed to attain his full potential as a\nrationalist,\nis that Harry is allowed to solve this problem\nthe way YOU would solve it.\nIf you can tell me exactly how to do something,\nHarry is allowed to think of it.",
      "But it does not serve as a\nsolution to say, for example,\n\"Harry should persuade Voldemort to let him out of the\nbox\"\nif you can't yourself figure out how.",
      "The rules on Fanfiction\ndot Net allow at most one review per chapter.\nPlease submit *ONLY ONE* review of Ch. 113,\nto submit one suggested solution.",
      "For the best experience, if you\nhave not already been following\nInternet conversations about recent chapters, I suggest\nnot doing so,\ntrying to complete this exam on your own,\nnot looking at other reviews,\nand waiting for Ch. 114 to see how you did.",
      "I wish you all the best of luck,\nor rather the best of skill.",
      "Ch. 114 will post at\n10AM Pacific (6PM UTC) on Tuesday, March 3rd,\n2015.",
      "ADDED:",
      "If you have pending exams,\nthen even though the bystander effect is a thing,I\nexpect that the collective effect of\n'everyone with more urgent life issues stays out of the\neffort'\nshifts the probabilities very little\n(because diminishing marginal returns on more eyes\nand an already-huge population that is participating).",
      "So if you can't take the\ntime, then please don't.\nLike any author, I enjoy the delicious taste of my readers'\nsuffering,\nfiner than any chocolate; but I don't want to *hurt*\nyou.",
      "Likewise, if you hate hate hate\nthis sort of thing, then don't participate!\nOther people ARE enjoying it. Just come back in a few days.\nI shouldn't even need to point this out.",
      "I remind you again that you have\nhours to think.\nUse the Hold Off On Proposing Solutions, Luke.",
      "And really truly, I do mean\nit,\nHarry cannot develop any new magical powers\nor transcend previously stated constraints on them\nin the next sixty seconds."

      "Fifty seconds.",
      "Forty seconds.",

Yet, to tell you ssuch\nthoughtss might lead to desstruction of world.

Or\nto tell you ssuch might prevent desstruction of world, ssince you\ndo sseem motivated to avoid it. Not allowed to make ssuch a\ndecission mysself. Would need to awaken and conssult girl-child\nfriend. Vow requiress.\"",
      "There was a long pause. The Dark Lord, floating above and behind\nthe curve of Death Eaters with leveled wands, began to laugh as\nSalazar Slytherin had thought a snake would laugh, cold amusement\nin the form of a hiss. \"Do you know how to desstroy world,\nthen?\u202f\"",
      "\"Cannot deliberately try to imagine method. You might have\nway for sservant to ssteal my thoughtss. Vow prohibitss. But\nssusspect I could devisse method, if girl-child ssaid to\ntry.\"",

      "Slowly Harry's vision tracked across the graveyard in careful\narcs, ignoring the Dark Lord except as a floating blackness in his\nperipheral vision. His mouth went on speaking with only half his\nattention. \"Have thought of idea you might not have\nconssidered, teacher. Your attempt to kill me might fail in certain\nsspecific way desspite all your precautionss, perhapss lead into my\ndesstroying world later. Would not ordinarily deem probable, but\nwith prophecy at hand, may well be sso.\"",
      "Voldemort went still, in the air. \"How?\u202f\"",
      "\"Am not obligated to tell you.\"",
      "A cold anger began to seethe through the snakish reply.\n\"Though I undersstand well your dessperation and attempted\nclevernesss, thiss beginss to annoy me.

      "\"No. Vow doess not obligate me to any possitive\naction.\"",
      "The Dark Lord stared down at Harry Potter, who glanced up at the\nangry face only briefly before his eyes went back to the next Death\nEater. Some of them were shifting their stances slightly, but they\nstood still, and said no words as they leveled their wands. The\nsilver skull masks could not be read.",
      "Then the Dark Lord began to chuckle again. \"Ssurvive your\ndeath, you think you might? No, child, my horcruxess are not linked\nto you alsso. I would know if they were. Or iss there other reasson\nyou think you might ssurvive beyond my ways of enssuring your\ndeath?\u202f\"",

      "From a tiny spot on the end of Harry's wand, a cubic millimeter\nof anchor, stretched out a thin line of Transfigured spider-silk.\nIt would have broken at once, if tested; it would have gone\nunremarked, if any had noticed its glint. Less than a tenth of a\nmillimeter in cross-section, the tiny shape represented by the\nextended line of spider-silk was something Harry could Transfigure\nswiftly, ten centimeters of length to a cubic millimeter of total\nvolume; and Harry could Transfigure a cubic millimeter in a\nfraction of a second. He was forcing the Transfiguration outward,\nextending it through the air as fast as he could without risking\nthe transformation.",

      "The last Death Eater was looped. The pattern of spider-silk was\ncomplete. The web had been drawn with loops around all the Death\nEater's necks.

They moved lightly through\nthe air toward the Dark Lord himself, toward the sleeve just above\nVoldemort's left hand that held the gun, toward the sleeve above\nthe right hand that held the yew wand, threads placed high at first\nto give them time to drift slowly downward through the air. The\nthreads looped around, went over themselves, tied slippable knots.\nBegan to tighten, coming closer to the sleeve, as Harry\nTransfigured them shorter -",
      "Harry felt the tickle of Voldmort's power beginning to touch his\nown in the back of his mind; at the same time the Dark Lord's eyes\nwidened, his mouth opened.",

      "Something like a fugue state had come over Harry's mind. The\nabsolute state had partially worn off him, partially stayed with\nhim. Elements of his mind were numb, maybe deliberately numbed by\nsome part that was smart enough to predict what would happen\notherwise. What he'd just done -",
      "The thought was shut off, making space for an awareness of other\nthings.",
      "Harry was standing in the middle of a haphazard graveyard,\ntombstones scattered without order.",
      "By moonlight and starlight, it could be seen that black robes\nlittered the ground, surrounded by textures that didn't match the\nsurrounding graveyard earth, wetness tinged red in the moonlight.\nSome heads had come loose from the surrounding hoods of the robes,\nrevealing hair that was long or short, dark or bright, which was\nall that could be seen beneath the moon. The silver masks stayed\non, making all the hair originate in skulls instead of human faces\n-",
      "The thought was shut off, making space for awareness of other\nthings.",
      "A girl in a red-trimmed Hogwarts uniform slept upon an altar.\nNear the altar, Harry's things lay in a heap.",
      "Upon the ground lay a too-tall pale man of inhuman face, blood\npouring from the stumps of his wrists.",
      "As soon as the Dark Lord Voldemort awakens, he will destroy\neverything you love. Dumbledore is no longer there to stop\nhim.",
      "He cannot be imprisoned, for he can abandon his body at any\ntime.",
      "He cannot be killed permanently, not without destroying more\nthan a hundred horcruxes, one of which is the Pioneer\nplaque.",
      "Materials: One wand, you are allowed to point it and speak\nthis time.",
      "You have five minutes.",
      "Solve.",
      "Harry stumbled toward the altar, knelt at its side, and picked\nup his pouch.",
      "He walked toward where Voldemort lay.",
      "The sense of apprehension had diminished, after Voldemort had\nbeen hexed unconscious. Now, as Harry approached, it rose to a\nterrifying height, flaring also into pain in his scar.",
      "Harry ignored the inner shriek. That had been the last memory of\nTom Riddle seared into Harry's brain, the last cognitive pattern to\nbe transferred over into the infant baby before Tom Riddle had\nexploded: a sense of mounting horror and dismay associated with the\nresonance that had spun out of control. Harry knew the meaning of\nit now, that sense of apprehension, and that made it easier to\ndisregard. He'd guessed that the effect of the resonance mostly hit\nthe caster, with power proportional to the caster's power, and the\nbet had paid off.",
      "Harry looked upon Voldemort's body, and breathed deeply -\nthrough his mouth, because coppery smells Harry was not thinking\nabout were coming in through his nose.",
      "Harry knelt by Voldemort's side, took out his medical kit from\nhis pouch, and placed a self-tightening tourniquet around the\nbody's left wrist, then another tourniquet about the right.",
      "It felt wrong, showing Voldemort that concern. Some\npart of Harry was aware, in the back of his mind, that some number\nof people had just had something extremely bad happen to them. What\nwould have been balance, what would have been justice, was if\nVoldemort had suffered the same fate without an instant's more\nhesitation. What Harry was doing now felt like Batman showing more\nconcern for the Joker than for the Joker's victims; it felt like a\ncomic book where the writers wrung their hands endlessly about the\nmorality of killing the Big Named Villains while innocents went on\ndying in the background. To show more solicitousness for the head\nvillain than his minions, to pay more attention to his\nfate than the fates of his lower-status followers, was a flaw in\nhuman nature.",
      "So it felt wrong when Harry rose up from beside the body, the\ntourniquets having tightened upon Voldemort's wrists; it felt like\nHarry was doing something ethically monstrous.",
      "Even though any sane strategic thinking said that Voldemort's\nbody must not die. The soul he'd created for himself had\nto be anchored in this brain, it mustn't be allowed to float\nfree.",
      "Harry stepped back, back from Voldemort's unconscious body,\nbreathing deeply through his mouth. He went to the pile of his\nthings, to put on his robes and other items, starting with placing\nthe Time-Turner around his throat once more, readying his own\nescape and return if that was required...",
      "More than a hundred horcruxes.",
      "That had been insane, there wasn't any other word for it, a sign\nof Voldemort's damaged thinking about death. A Muggle security\nexpert would have called it fence-post security, like building a\nfence-post over a hundred metres high in the middle of the desert.\nOnly a very obliging attacker would try to climb the fence-post.\nAnyone sensible would just walk around the fence-post, and making\nthe fence-post even higher wouldn't stop that.",
      "Once you forgot to be scared of how impossible the problem was\nsupposed to be, it wasn't even difficult, not by comparison to the\nlast one.",
      "Neville's parents, for example, had been Crucioed into permanent\ninsanity. Two hundred advanced horcruxes wouldn't prevent that\ninsanity, they would all just echo the same damaged mind.",
      "It would be an ethically justified use of the Cruciatus Curse,\nif that were the only way to stop Voldemort permanently. It would\nbe justice, balance, it would show that the Joker's life wasn't\nworth more than his meanest henchman...",
      "All Harry needed to do was cast the Patronus Charm, send it\nto... Alastor Moody?... and tell him to come here. Well, no, it was\na pretty good guess the Patronus Charm wouldn't work if it was cast\nwith that intent. Maybe just resolve to tell Moody that,\nand use his Time-Turner once he was out of range of Voldemort's\nwards.",
      "And then Voldemort could be Crucioed into permanent\ninsanity.",
      "It wasn't even the least merciful fate. That would have been\nthrowing Voldemort's wand into the pit at Azkaban, if the wand\nstayed connected to Voldemort's life and magic no matter where his\nghost tried to flee.",
      "Harry turned to face where Voldemort lay. He walked forward, and\ncontinued to control his breathing, ignoring the burning feeling in\nhis throat. Some part of him knew that Voldemort was also\nProfessor Quirrell, even though his body now was different. Even\nthough the shift of personality had been perfect and that meant\nthat Professor Quirrell had been just another mask...",
      "Though Voldemort hadn't planned to kill Harry painfully. Hadn't\nthought to strike Harry with his followers' Cruciatus, when Harry\nwas being annoying before. That meant something, when your opponent\nwas Voldemort. Maybe he'd had some remaining shred of\nfellow-feeling for the other Tom Riddle after all.",
      "...it would be wrong to take that into account.",
      "Wouldn't it?",
      "Harry looked back up at the stars. Here below the atmosphere the\nstars twinkled, they were embedded in the false dome of the night\nsky, stretched out across the wash of the Milky Way that glowed\nlike a long ribbon, as if they were all close enough that you could\nfly up to them on a broomstick and touch them.",
      "What would they want him to do now at this juncture, the\nchildren's children's children?",
      "The answer to that also felt obvious, if it wasn't just the part\nof Harry that still cared about Professor Quirrell doing the real\ntalking.",
      "Harry had needed to do the thing he'd done, it had\nprevented greater evils, Harry couldn't have stopped Voldemort if\nthe Death Eaters had fired first. But that thing Harry had done\nwasn't something that could be balanced by a not-necessary tragedy\nhappening to one more sentient being, even if that being was\nVoldemort. It would just be one more element of the sorrows of\nancient Earth so long ago.",
      "The past was past. You did what you had to do, and you didn't do\none scrap of harm more than that. Not even to balance things out,\nand make it all symmetrical.",
      "The children's children's children wouldn't want Voldemort to\ndie, even if his minions had. They wouldn't want Voldemort to hurt,\nif it didn't accomplish anything compared to him not hurting.",
      "Harry breathed deeply, and let go of - not his hate - not quite\nhis hate - he hadn't been able to hate his creator even at the very\nend - but even so, Harry let go of something. Of the sense\nthat he ought to hate Voldemort, that it was a hate he was\nobligated to feel, for the endless list of crimes that Voldemort\nhad committed for no good reason, not even his own happiness...",
      "It's all right, the stars whispered down at him.\nIt's all right not to hate him. It doesn't make you a bad\nperson.",
      "In the end, there was only one option he would take, and since\nHarry already knew that, there was no point agonizing about it.\nWhether it was the best option, only time would tell.",
      "Harry breathed deeply, building up the magic inside himself. The\nspell he was going to cast didn't need to be precise, but\nit was still one of the most powerful spells he'd mastered.",
      "Harry thought again of how unjust it was that Voldemort could\nnot die with his followers, felt the slight trace of coldness in\nhis blood that came with thoughts of ruthlessness. And then Harry\nlet it go, let it all drain away beneath the starlight, because his\ndark side had never been anything except an inherited pattern of\ncognition, just one more bad habit of thinking to break.",
      "Instead Harry looked at Hermione's breathing form atop the\naltar, and let the tears finally start from his eyes. What would\nbecome of Hermione now, what path she would choose after this,\nHarry couldn't guess; but she would be there to have a\nchoice, their friendship wouldn't have destroyed her existence. He\nhadn't realised how shaky his hope had been, until he'd noticed how\nsurprised he'd been after the hope had come true. Sometimes things\ndid go better than expected.",
      "And Harry took that thought, too, and put it into the magic he\nwas building.",
      "The power he was storing up was vibrating in him, like his whole\nbody was part of his wand, either Harry's eyes were blurring or\nthere was a luminous white quiver running over the holly. And Harry\nthought the shape of the spell he would cast, he didn't have much\nfine control but the pattern he needed was simple, it just needed\nto include -",
      "Everything, forget everything, Tom Riddle, Professor\nQuirrell, forget your whole life, forget your entire episodic\nmemory, forget the disappointment and the bitterness and the wrong\ndecisions, forget Voldemort -",
      "And at the last moment before Harry cast the spell, he had one\nfinal thought, a note of grace -",
      "But if you ever had any truly happy memories, not hurting\npeople or laughing at their pain, but the warm feeling of helping\nsomeone or being helped, there won't be many, maybe just when you\nwere a child, but if you had any truly happy memories then keep\nonly those -",
      "Something bright in him unfolded at the decision, knowing he'd\nmade the right choice, and Harry pushed that too into his wand\n-",
      "\"OBLIVIATE!\"",
      "And it all poured out of Harry into the spell.",
      "Harry fell over on his side, dropping his wand, gritted screams\ncoming from his throat, his hands going helplessly to his scar,\neven as the sudden blast of pain in his head began to fade. Only\ndimly did his eyes see that the air was filled with glowing\nsnowflakes, drifting motes of silver light like tiny specks of\nPatronus Charm.",
      "Only a moment the silver light lasted, and then it was gone.",
      "Professor Quirrell was gone.",
      "Nothing left but a remnant.",
      "And that spirit, what remained of it, wouldn't be so different\nnow from Harry's own.",
      "The Prophecy was complete.",
      "They had each remade the other in their own image.",
      "Harry started sobbing, then, from where he was curled up in the\ndirt.",
      "He cried for a while.",
      "And then eventually Harry staggered to his feet and picked up\nhis wand again, because this day's work wasn't quite done.",
      "Harry laid his wand directly on Voldemort's wrist-stump; it made\nhis scar throb with an ongoing pain, but neither of them\nexploded.",
      "And Harry began a Transfiguration.",
      "Slowly - though faster than Harry had been able to Transfigure\nHermione's body, last time - the stunned form of the snake-man\nchanged, reshaped itself. As the Transfiguration progressed,\nespecially as the snake-man's head began to turn glassy and\nshrunken, the pain in Harry's scar faded.",
      "It would be a spell to maintain whether Harry was waking or\nsleeping; and later, when Harry was older and more powerful and\nmaybe had some help, he would un-Transfigure the mindwiped Tom\nRiddle and heal his body with the power of the Stone.\nAfter future-Harry had figured out what to do with an\nalmost-completely-amnesiac wizard who still had some bad habits of\nthought and some highly negative emotional patterns - a dark side,\nas 'twere - plus a great deal of declarative and procedural\nknowledge about powerful magic. Harry had tried his best\nnot to Obliviate that part, because he might need it,\nsomeday.",
      "And meanwhile, just like magic hadn't defined a Transfigured\nunicorn as dead for purposes of setting off wards, Voldemort's\nhorcruxes wouldn't define a Transfigured Voldemort as dead and try\nto bring him back.",
      "That was the hope, anyway.",
      "Harry's scar twinged one last time when the steel ring went on\nhis pinky finger, holding the tiny green emerald in contact with\nhis skin. Then his scar subsided, and did not hurt again.",
      "An upthrust rock served Harry for a chair, when he staggered\nover it and sat down motionless, resting after a fashion, shoving\nback the exhaustion that threatened the corners of his mind. It\nwas not done, there was more to do.",
      "Harry took another deep breath, still inhaling through his\nmouth, said \"Lumos,\" and looked around the graveyard.",
      "Black robes and severed skull masks, surrounded by pools of\nblood -",
      "Hermione Granger, asleep on an altar.",
      "Voldemort's empty robes and bloody hands, lying where the Dark\nLord had fallen.",
      "Quirinus Quirrell with his shredded robes, fallen in a heap\nwhere the Killing Curse had stricken him.",
      "Harry imagined someone else looking at this scene, trying to\nunderstand it, and shook his head, because that wouldn't do, it\nwouldn't do at all.",
      "Then Harry shoved himself up from his rock, grimacing as his\nmind, if not body, protested. He hadn't been bloodied or beaten\nmuch today, but somehow Harry's body was managing to feel like all\nthe stress had hit it directly.",
      "Harry staggered over toward where Voldemort had fallen, and\npicked up Voldemort's left hand from where it lay upon the\nground.",
      "Even in just the left hand, you could see the faint trace of\nsnake's scales; it was very distinctively Voldemort. That was\ngood.",
      "Harry went to the altar where the sleeping Hermione lay, and\ngently placed the detached hand around Hermione's neck, carefully\nmoving the fingers to clutch at her throat. It was hard to do,\nHermione seemed so peaceful and innocent when she was sleeping, and\nVoldemort's severed hand seemed so ugly; Harry bluntly overrode\nwhatever part of his mind was thinking that, since it made no sense\nin context.",
      "A few weak Severing Charms served to mess up the almost\nperfectly fine cut the nanofiber had made, which was critical; it\nwould not do to have the hand-stump look like the neck-stumps. The\nmultiple Diffindos scattered small bits of Voldemort-wrist\nall over Hermione's shirt, which, Harry had to remind himself, was\nalso part of the plan.",
      "Harry repeated this with the right hand, arranging it\nsymmetrically with the left.",
      "Harry used Inflammare to singe Voldemort's robes where\nthey lay, and then arranged the singed clothing around\nHermione.",
      "Voldemort's gun, and his wand, went into Harry's pouch. Harry\nplaced the Stone of Permanency in an ordinary pocket, he wasn't\nsure what the Stone might do to his pouch.",
      "The heap of things from inside Quirrell's robe, also near the\naltar, yielded the wand that the Defense Professor had used when he\nwas being Quirrell. Harry went to where Quirrell lay, and\nstraightened out the body as best he could, and put Quirrell's wand\ninto his hand. Tears predictably came to Harry's eyes, and Harry\nwiped them away on his sleeve.",
      "Harry took another deep breath, still inhaling through his\nmouth, said \"Lumos\" again, and once more looked around the\ngraveyard.",
      "Black robes, severed skull masks, and Hermione Granger lying on\nan altar with Voldemort's severed hands clutched around her throat,\nand Voldemort's singed clothing scattered around her. Quirinus\nQuirrell lay dead with his clothes torn and shredded, his wand in\nhis right hand.",
      "That would do.",
      "There remained the problem of calling attention to it.",
      "Harry was very nearly out of magic at this point. But he still\nhad enough left to Transfigure a leaf into the deflated form of a\nthree-meter weather balloon.",
      "Harry's pouch produced a bottle of oxyacetelene, and a stick of\ndynamite, and a spool of fuse-cord. Be prepared, that's the Boy\nScout's marching song, be prepared for a life that includes\nmountain trolls and who knows what else...",
      "Harry inflated the weather balloon with the oxyacetelene. That\nwould produce a very sharp overpressure when it detonated, maybe as\nloud as a sonic boom.",
      "He attached the stick of dynamite - it was overkill, for\ndetonation, but it would do.",
      "He attached a 60-second fuse to the stick of dynamite, but did\nnot light it yet.",
      "Harry put on his Cloak of Invisibility, that had been among the\npiles by the sacrificial altar.",
      "He obtained his broomstick from his pouch, and mounted it.",
      "Harry cast a Quieting Charm around Hermione Granger - it\nwouldn't stop all the noise, not even close, and it wasn't\nlike she'd be permanently hurt if her eardrums burst, but it still\nseemed polite.",
      "And then that was it. The Quieting Charm had done it. Harry was\ndrained of magic for at least the next hour.",
      "Harry mounted the broomstick, slowly rising into the air,\nlifting the weather balloon filled with oxyacetelene with him. The\ncastle Hogwarts came into view, distantly gleaming in moonlight a\nfew kilometers away, as Harry rose above the trees; and Harry did\nhis best to figure the distance, and the angle as it would be seen\nfrom Hogwarts.",
      "When he had risen high above the forest, Harry used a lighter to\nignite the fuse on the dynamite attached to the weather balloon\nfull of oxyacetelene. Then Harry spun the broomstick and darted\naway - though not directly toward the castle, that might take him\ntoo close to the route past-Harry and Professor Quirrell had\ntraversed, it wouldn't do to have the Professor sense another Harry\n-",
      "Harry felt a leaden stab of sadness, and refused it.",
      "Thirty-one one-thousand, thirty-two one-thousand,\nthirty-three one-thousand...",
      "When Harry reached forty, not wanting to take chances with his\nown eardrums, he glanced at his wristwatch, noting the exact time,\nand spun his Time-Turner once.",

      "At first Anna had been gratified to see the final Quidditch Cup\ngo on so long - as a Gryffindor she was a bystander at the House\nCup thing, it wasn't like Gryffindor ever won. In contrast, last\nyear's World Cup of Quidditch, to which her family had bought some\nvery expensive tickets, had been over in ten minutes which\nwas awful. Modern Quidditch games had become too short,\nthe Snitch caught much too quickly. It was a widely-talked problem\namong aficionados: broomstick enchantments had advanced, while the\nSnitch stayed the same regulation speed, with the result that\nQuidditch games had become shorter and shorter. At professional\nlevels the sport of Quidditch had been reduced to a contest of who\nhad the deepest pockets for their Seeker's experimental racing\nbroom, and the rest of the players might as well have been watching\nfrom the stands.",
      "Everyone knew something had to be done, the situation had been\ngetting worse for centuries and now it was\nintolerable. But the International Confederation of\nWizards' Quidditch Committee was mired in all the usual acrimony of\nthe I.C.W., screaming disputes between Germans and Bulgarians, and\nsomehow nobody could agree on exactly how to fix the\nrules. To Anna the correct course seemed obvious, just make the\nSnitch fast enough to restore the four-hour or five-hour games of\nthe early nineteenth century and the Golden Age of Quidditch.\nExcept the Belgians thought the duration of a professional game\nshould be two hours like in La Belle \u00c9poque when\nBelgium had dominated Quidditch, and the lunatic Italians wanted to\ngo back to the week-long Quidditch games of the fourteenth century,\nand Britain's even crazier blood purists kept on talking up the\noccasional day-long Quidditch match as proof that broomsticks\ncouldn't really have improved since everything was better\nin the old days which was not how the Interdict of Merlin\nworked.",
      "She was one hundred percent on the side of Harry Potter that it\nwas time for Hogwarts to give up on those gibbering slowpokes and\njust change the rules, starting here and now. But not by\neliminating the Snitch, that was going all the way back to\neleventh century Kwidditch. It didn't matter if\nHeadmistress Hufflepuff had first introduced the innovation because\none of her students had wanted to play the game but not been suited\nto the usual roles. Snitches had caught on internationally because\nit was more exciting when the game could always end in the next\nminute.",
      "Anna had been arguing this viewpoint at the top of her lungs for\nthe last thirty minutes, quite forgetting to pay attention to the\ngame. Thanks to a lucky coincidence of seating she'd been near the\nBoy-Who-Lived and his sign, and hence she'd managed to stake out\nher position right from the start.",
      "She was aware, in the back of her mind, that if the Quidditch\nrules really did change starting here and now, then this\nwas the most important thing she'd ever do. She could\nalmost feel the pressure of Time twisting around her as\nthough the fate of Quidditch Itself were being settled this very\nday, and she was standing close to the center of it... though she\nhadn't gotten high-enough scores in Divination to actually sense\nanything like that, of course.",
      "She hardly noticed when at one point the Boy-Who-Lived stood up\nto go to the bathroom.",
      "The Boy-Who-Lived did catch her eye when he trudged back; Harry\nPotter looked a bit tired and wobbly, though his uniform appeared\nas trim as if he'd just changed into a new one.",
      "She noticed half an hour later on, when Harry Potter seemed to\nsway a bit, and then hunch over, his hands going to cover up his\nforehead; it looked like he was prodding at his forehead scar. The\nthought made her slightly worried; everyone knew there was\nsomething going on with Harry Potter, and if Potter's scar\nwas hurting him then it was possible that a sealed horror was about\nto burst out of his forehead and eat everyone. She dismissed that\nthought, though, and continued to explain Quidditch facts to the\nhistorically ignorant at the top of her lungs.",
      "She definitely noticed when Harry Potter stood up, hands still\non his forehead, and dropped his hands to reveal that his famous\nlightning-bolt scar was now blazing red and inflamed. It was\nbleeding, with the blood dripping down Potter's nose.",
      "She stopped talking mid-sentence. Other people turned to look at\nwhat she was staring at.",
      "\"Professor McGonagall?\" Harry Potter said in a wavering voice.\nThere were tears in the corners of his eyes, which shocked her; the\nBoy-Who-Lived did not seem like the sort of person who\nwould burst into tears. Harry Potter raised his voice further, as\nthough it were hard for him to speak. \"Um, Professor\nMcGonagall?\"",
      "Professor McGonagall turned away from where she was arguing with\nthe Hufflepuff Quidditch team. The Head of Gryffindor's eyes\nwidened in shock, and then she was moving people out of her way,\nalmost running. \"Harry!\" she said. \"Your scar!\u202f\"",
      "Silence was spreading, in a widening circle.",
      "\"I think,\" Harry said, his voice still wavering but louder, \"I\nthink he's back. I think I'm seeing - through Voldemort's mind\n-\"",
      "Anna took a step back at You-Know-Who's name and nearly fell\nover a bleacher. An older boy standing next to her gave a cry of\ndismay, and then the Boy-Who-Lived shrieked even louder.",
      "\"HE'S KILLING THEM!\" screamed Harry Potter.",
      "Half the Quidditch stadium turned to look at him.",
      "\"The ritual!\" cried Harry Potter. \"Blood of his servants! The\nblood, the life! He summoned them, he took their heads, their\nblood, the life, to renew his own - THE DARK LORD RISES,\nVOLDEMORT IS RETURNED!\"",
      "Madam Hooch blew a shrill whistle, and the Quidditch brooms that\nhadn't already stopped in midair began to slow. For herself she\nwasn't sure if this was a joke; if it was, Boy-Who-Lived or not, he\nwas in more trouble than she could even imagine.",
      "Professor McGonagall raised her wand into position for a\nQuieting Charm and Harry Potter caught her hand.",
      "\"Wait -\" Harry Potter gasped, his voice lower, but still loud\nenough that she and the people near her could hear clearly. \"He can\nbe stopped - I see his mind, his mistake - he can be stopped\nnow - THE WAY IS STILL OPEN! SHE'S FOLLOWING HIM! SHE\nWHO VOLDEMORT SLEW!\u202f\" Harry's voice rose further, as Anna's\nown mouth fell open in sudden confusion. \"RETURN! RETURN,\nRETURN, REVIVE AND STOP HIM! STOP HIM, HERMIONE!\u202f\"",
      "And then Harry Potter fell silent. He looked around at the\npeople staring at him.",
      "She'd just about decided that this had to all be a prank in\nunbelievably poor taste, when a distant but sharp CRACK\nfilled the air.",
      "Harry Potter swayed, and fell to his knees, even as her heart\njumped into her throat. An explosion of excited babble rose around\nthem.",
      "She could still hear the words from Harry Potter's mouth, as\nProfessor McGonagall knelt next to him. \"It worked,\" Harry Potter\ngasped aloud, \"she got him, he's gone.\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" cried Professor McGonagall, then glanced\naround. \"Quiet! Quiet, all of you! Harry, what\nhappened?\"",
      "Harry Potter was speaking rapidly but loudly. \"Voldemort - tried\nto revive - he summoned Death Eaters and he killed them,\nstole their blood and life - Hermione's body was there, I don't\nknow why, maybe Voldemort was planning to use it for something -\nVoldemort came back, he resurrected himself, but Hermione\nfollowed him back and she destroyed him, he's\ngone, it's over. It happened in a graveyard near Hogwarts, it's,\"\nHarry Potter rose to his feet, still swaying, \"I think it's in that\ndirection.\" Harry Potter pointed in the rough direction the CRACK\nhad come from, \"I'm not sure how far. The sound from there took\ntwenty seconds to get here, so maybe two minutes on a broomstick\n-\"",
      "With a motion so smooth it looked unconscious, Professor\nMcGonagall shifted into a stance and said \"Expecto\nPatronum.\" She addressed the glowing cat that then\nappeared. \"Go to Albus, tell him he must come at once -\"",
      "\"Dumbledore's gone!\" cried Harry Potter. \"The Headmaster is\ngone, Professor McGonagall! The Dark Lord trapped him, he reversed\nsome kind of trap the Headmaster planned and Dumbledore was caught\noutside Time, he's gone!\"",
      "The horrified babble around them rose in pitch.",
      "\"Go to Albus!\" Professor McGonagall said to her Patronus.",
      "The moonlit cat only looked at McGonagall sadly, and Anna sucked\nin her breath in sudden horror, feeling like someone had punched\nher in the stomach. It was real, it was all real, this wasn't a\njoke.",
      "\"Professor McGonagall, Hermione is alive!\u202f\" Harry\nPotter raised his voice again. \"She's really alive and not an\nInferius or anything, and she's still there in the graveyard!\"",
      "\"A broomstick!\" Professor McGonagall shouted. She\nturned to the players hovering motionless over the Quidditch field.\n\"I need a broomstick. NOW!\"",
      "Despite everything, Anna raised a hand in mute protest, then\ncaught herself, even as the Ravenclaw and Slytherin Seekers came\nzooming over (with excellent strategic sense, since they weren't\nactually doing anything).",
      "Harry Potter was already retrieving another broomstick from his\npouch, a multi-person one.",
      "Professor McGonagall saw this, and nodded firmly. \"You stay\nhere, Mr. Potter, unless there is some excellent reason you must be\nthere. I will go at once.\"",
      "\"You mustn't!\" squeaked Professor Flitwick, who'd shoved his\ntiny way through the crowd, occasionally running under someone's\nlegs. His eyes were wide, he looked as though he wanted to faint.\n\"You have to stay at Hogwarts, Minerva! You - you're the -\"\nProfessor Flitwick seemed to be having trouble speaking.",
      "Professor McGonagall spun around to face Professor Flitwick, and\nthen stopped, blood draining from her face.",
      "Then she seized the broomstick from Harry Potter's hand, and\npresented it to the tiny half-goblin Professor. \"Filius,\" she said\ncrisply. All the incipient panic had disappeared from her voice,\nshe now spoke in her crisp Scottish accent as though addressing\nlessons on Monday. \"Look for the graveyard of which Mr. Potter\nspoke, find Miss Granger. Apparate her to St. Mungo's and then stay\nby her.\"",
      "\"I think -\" Harry Potter said hoarsely. \"I think Transfiguration\nmight have been used in combat there - Professor Quirrell tried to\nfight Voldemort - take precautions -\"",
      "Filius Flitwick nodded without halting in getting on the\nbroomstick.",
      "\"Professor Quirrell's dead!\" wailed Harry Potter. The anguish in\nhis voice carried clearly. \"He's dead! The Dark Lord killed him!\nHis body -\" Harry Potter choked up. \"It's there, in the\ngraveyard.\"",
      "She stumbled back again, feeling it like another punch in her\ngut. Professor Quirrell had been - one of her favorite Professors,\never, he'd made her rethink everything she'd believed\nabout Slytherin, she'd known in some distant way that he was\nprobably going to die very soon but to hear that he was really,\ntruly dead...",
      "The Boy-Who-Lived sat down on the bench, as if his legs couldn't\nsupport him anymore.",
      "Professor McGonagall turned to the crowd, touching her wand to\nher throat. \"QUIDDITCH IS OVER,\" her amplified voice boomed out.\n\"GO BACK TO YOUR DORMITORIES -\"",
      "\"Don't!\u202f\" screamed Harry Potter.",
      "Professor McGonagall turned to look at him.",
      "Tears were leaking down the Boy-Who-Lived's cheeks, he looked\nlike the interruption had surprised himself as much as it had\nsurprised anyone else. \"It was Professor Quirrell's last plot,\"\nHarry Potter said, his voice breaking. The Boy-Who-Lived looked at\nthe Quidditch players who had now flown to nearby, as though\nspeaking to them directly. \"His last plot.\"",
      "Harry Potter was floated off by Professor McGonagall to the\ninfirmary. The other Professors ran off to oversee who-knew-what,\nleaving only Professors Sinistra and Hooch behind. At the stadium,\nrumors ran wild; Anna repeated everything she could remember\nhearing as best she could. Something had happened to Dumbledore,\nsome Death Eaters had been summoned and killed (no, Harry Potter\nhadn't said which ones), Professor Quirrell had gone out to face\nthe Dark Lord and died for it, You-Know-Who had returned and died\nagain, Professor Quirrell was dead, he was dead.",
      "In time most of the students wandered off back to their\ndormitories, to sleep if they could.",
      "Anna stayed in the stadium, and watched the rest of the game,\nignoring her body's need for sleep, and her eyes that often blurred\nwith tears.",
      "The Ravenclaw team put up a valiant fight.",
      "But there was no Quidditch team anywhere that could've defeated\nthe Slytherins that day.",
      "Dawn was tinging the sky when the Slytherins won their final\ngame, the Quidditch Cup, and the House Cup.",

      "The morning after had come, and all the students had gathered\nsilently around the four Tables of Hogwarts, Harry James\nPotter-Evans-Verres among them. He had collapsed in exhaustion last\nnight and been awoken in the infirmary next morning, still muzzy,\nwith the Philosopher's Stone underneath his left sock.",
      "The Head Table looked like a plague had swept it.",
      "Dumbledore's throne was gone from the Head Table, without\nreplacement, leaving the center of the Head Table empty.",
      "Severus Snape was sitting in a floating seat, the magical\nequivalent of a wheelchair.",
      "Professor Sprout was missing. According to what Harry had been\ntold last night, a court Legilimens would examine her to see if any\nfurther compulsions remained, but probably no charges would be\nfiled. Harry had emphasized to Professor McGonagall and the Aurors,\nas hard as he could, that Professor Sprout was probably just a\nvictim. The Boy-Who-Lived had pronounced that he'd seen no evidence\nof Sprout's intentional guilt in Voldemort's mind.",
      "Professor Flitwick was missing, presumably still staying by\nHermione's side.",
      "Professor Sinistra was missing and Harry didn't know why or\nwhere.",
      "The numbness that surrounded Harry's mind was like a Mylar\nblanket, protective if not comforting. There were scenes in his\nmind of black robes falling and blood spilling, appearing for an\ninstant before being shoved back. He'd process it later, not now.\nSome other time would be better, future-Harry would have a\ncomparative advantage at coping.",
      "Somewhere inside Harry was the fear that it wouldn't\nhurt, that there would be no price to be paid. But that fear also\ncould be put off into the future.",
      "No breakfast had appeared on the tables. The students sitting\nnear Harry were waiting in frightened silence. Owls had been\nprohibited from entering or leaving Hogwarts since early last\nnight.",
      "The doors of the Great Hall opened once more, and forth came\nDeputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall. She wore robes of formal\nblack, and her head was bare, denuded of its usual witch's hat. Her\ngrey-brown-blonde hair was done up in a coiled braid, as if in\npreparation for a hat to be placed later; but for now Harry saw her\nhead bare for the first time.",
      "Minerva McGonagall came to the lectern that stood before the\nHead Table.",
      "All eyes were upon her.",
      "\"I am afraid that I have much news,\" Minerva said. Her voice was\nsad, within its Scottish precision. \"And most of it is terrible.\nFirst. The reason I am the one to speak to you is that the\nHeadmaster of Hogwarts, Albus,\" her voice stopped, \"Percival\nWulfric Brian Dumbledore, has been lost. You-Know-Who trapped him\noutside Time, and we do not know if he ever can be brought back to\nus. We, we have lost, what may have been, the greatest Headmaster,\nthat Hogwarts has ever had.\"",
      "A susurration of horror arose across the tables, no audible\ngasps or moans, just the sound of many intaken breaths; most from\nGryffindor, and some from Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw as well. The ill\nnews had already been known, but now it had also been said by\nauthority.",
      "\"Second. You-Know-Who returned briefly, but is once again dead.\nAll that remained of him was his hands clutched around Miss\nGranger's throat. There is no more threat from him, or so we\nthink.\" Minerva McGonagall drew in another breath. \"Third.\nProfessor Quirrell died with his wand in his hand, facing\nYou-Know-Who. He was found not far from where You-Know-Who perished\nagain, a victim of You-Know-Who's Killing Curse.\" Another\nsusurration of verified horror, now from all four tables.",
      "Minerva drew another breath. \"Last night we also lost what may\nhave been the greatest Defense Professor in the history of\nHogwarts. His scholastic merits alone... Our Defense Professor has\ngone by many names, but his true name was David Monroe. As he was\nthe last of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Monroe, his funeral\n- his second funeral, and the true one - will be held before the\nMost Ancient Hall of the Wizengamot, in two days. Yet a wake shall\nalso be held for the Defense Professor of Hogwarts, for our own\nProfessor Quirrell, in this castle. That man also died a Hogwarts\nteacher, as nobly as a Hogwarts teacher ever did.\"",
      "Harry listened in silence, shoving down the tears that again\nrose to his eyes. It wasn't even true, let alone\nunexpected; and yet hearing it still hurt. From where he sat\nbeside, Anthony Goldstein put a comforting hand over Harry's hand,\nand Harry left it there.",
      "\"Fourth. One piece of exceedingly unexpected and happy news.\nHermione Granger is alive and in full health, sound of body and\nmind. Miss Granger is being observed at St. Mungo's to see if there\nare any unexpected afteraffects from whatever happened to her, but\nshe appears to be doing astonishingly well considering her previous\ncondition.\"",
      "It should have produced wild cheers from Ravenclaw and\nGryffindor, if the news had come as part of any other package, or\nif it had been more unexpected. As it stood, Harry saw a few\nsmiles, but they were brief. Maybe they'd jumped for joy earlier,\nbut at the moment there was only silence. Harry understood that. He\nwasn't cheering either, not right now.",
      "\"Finally -\" Minerva McGonagall faltered, then raised her voice.\n\"I fear that I have the gravest possible news to share with some of\nour students. It seems that You-Know-Who summoned those who were\nonce his followers; and many of them obeyed, whether from terribly\nmisguided loyalty, or out of fear for their families if they\nrefused. A sacrifice was required, it seems, to complete\nYou-Know-Who's resurrection; or perhaps You-Know-Who blamed his\nformer followers for his defeat. Thirty-seven bodies were found,\nmore followers outside Azkaban than You-Know-Who was thought to\nhave. I am afraid -\" Minerva McGonagall faltered again. \"I am\nafraid that among the deceased are the parents of many of our\nstudents -\"",
      "no no no no no no NO NO NO NO",
      "As though by some terrible magnet, Harry's eyes were drawn to\nthe picture of absolute horror that was Draco Malfoy's face, even\nas the comforting cotton wrap around Harry's thoughts was torn away\nlike thin tissue.",
      "How could he have not thought, how could he have not realised\n-",
      "Somewhere in the background, someone was already screaming, and\nyet the room seemed very silent.",
      "\"Sheila, Flora, and Hestia Carrow. Lost both their parents last\nnight. Students who have lost their fathers include Robert Jugson.\nEthan Jugson. Sara Jugson. Michael MacNair. Riley and Randy\nRookwood. Lily Lu. Sasha Sproch. Daniel Gibson. Jason Gross. Elsie\nAmbrose -\"",
      "Maybe Lucius realised, maybe he was smart enough to stay\naway, maybe he realised that Voldemort was the one who struck at\nDraco -",
      "\"- Theodore Nott. Vincent Crabbe. Gregory Goyle. Draco Malfoy.\nThis concludes the list.\"",
      "One student sitting at the Gryffindor table let out a single\ncheer, and was immediately slapped by the Gryffindor witch sitting\nnearby hard enough that a Muggle would have lost teeth.",
      "\"Thirty points from Gryffindor and detention for the first month\nof next year,\" Professor McGonagall said, her voice hard enough to\nbreak stone.",
      "\"Lies!\u202f\" shrieked a tall Slytherin, who'd risen up from\nthat table. \"Lies! Lies! The Dark Lord will return, and he'll,\nhe'll teach you all the meaning of -\"",
      "\"Mr. Jugson,\" said Severus Snape's voice. It was also faltering,\nit didn't sound like the Potions Master at all, it wasn't loud and\nyet the Slytherin fell silent. \"Robert. The Dark Lord killed your\nfather.\"",
      "Robert Jugson let out a scream of terrific fury and turned to\nrun out of the room, and Draco Malfoy folded in on himself like a\ncollapsing house and made sounds that nobody heard, because the\nbabble was starting up now.",
      "Harry rose six inches from the bench and then stopped.",
      "what would you say to Draco there is nothing you can say to\nDraco you can't go over there now and pretend to be his friend",
      "you want to make it right you want to make it better but you\ncannot make it right there is no way you can make right what you\nhave done to him what you did to Vincent to Gregory what you did to\nTheodore",
      "The world blurred around Harry, he barely saw Padma Patil rise\nup and make her way toward the Slytherin table and Draco, or Seamus\nheading towards Theodore.",
      "And because Harry had read his father's science fiction and\nfantasy collection, because he had already read this scene a dozen\ntimes over when it happened to other protagonists, there was an\nimage in Harry's mind of Mad-Eye Moody, of the scarred man called\nAlastor. And Mad-Eye's image was saying, in just the same voice\nhe'd used to speak to Albus Dumbledore in memory, that the Death\nEaters had been pointing their wands at Harry, that they had\nalready chosen to take the Dark Mark, that they had been guilty of\nsins beyond reckoning and maybe beyond Harry's imagination, that\nthey had foregone the deontological protection of good people and\nmade themselves targetable if there was a strong reason to\nsacrifice them. That it had been necessary to save Harry's innocent\nparents from torture and Azkaban, that it had been necessary to\nprotect the world from Voldemort. That plain old ordinary Aurors\nand judges had to do much more morally questionable things than\nkilling sworn and blooded Death Eaters who were pointing wands at\nthem, in the course of carrying out ordinary justices that were\nless clear-cut but still necessary to society. If it were not right\nto do what Harry had done, if it were not right to do much\nmore morally ambiguous things than what Harry had done,\nthen society as human beings knew it could not exist. Nobody with\ncommon sense would blame Harry for doing it, Neville wouldn't blame\nhim, Professor McGonagall wouldn't blame him, Dumbledore wouldn't\nblame him, even Hermione would tell him it had been the right thing\nto do once she knew.",
      "And all of this was true.",
      "Just as it was also true that some part of Harry's mind had\ncalculated that wiping out the blood purist political elite would\nmake it easier and more convenient to rebuild magical Britain\nafterward. It hadn't been an important consideration, but it had\nstill been calculated in those instants of rapid thought, a check\non the long-term consequences to see if they rated as catastrophic,\nand a decision that they actually rated as pretty much okay. And\nthat check had forgotten that Death Eaters had children at Hogwarts\nor that one of them wore the face of Draco's father. It wouldn't\nhave changed anything. It wouldn't have changed anything at all.\nBut that was the truth of the calculation Harry's mind had\nperformed, given only seconds to think.",
      "At least Harry could, if the Death Eaters' survivors were in any\nsort of financial trouble, do something about that easily enough.\nTransfigure gold, and use the Stone to make it permanent - unless\nmaking that much gold would be troublesome to the wizard economy at\nlarge, or cause objections from goblins who didn't understand\nmarket monetarist economics - though it wasn't as though Harry\ndidn't also have useful services to sell -",
      "Other cotton wrap was also being torn off Harry's thoughts,\nnow.",
      "\"It seems likely,\" Minerva said, her voice was not loud but it\ncut through all other sounds, \"that some of our students will also\nhave been stripped last night of those named as their guardians.\nShould you end up a ward of Hogwarts, please know that I will take\nthe responsibilities of my position with extreme seriousness. You\nwill be extended every courtesy. Your family's vault will be\nmanaged well and truly. As best I can, I will treat every one of\nyou as I would my own children - and I will protect you as much as\nI would protect my own children, no more, no less. I hope that is\nclear to EVERYONE AT HOGWARTS.\"",
      "Students nodded rapidly.",
      "\"Good,\" Minerva said. Her voice sank back. \"Then there is one\nmore thing that must be done.\"",
      "With a sad, solemn air, Professor Sinistra emerged from a side\nentrance. She was wearing white robes instead of her usual brown,\nand instead of her customary witch's hat, she was wearing a\nmany-tasseled square hat whose colors had faded into mostly\ngray.",
      "In her hands, Professor Sinistra carried the Sorting Hat.",
      "With the air of someone carrying out a ceremony that had not\nchanged in centuries, Aurora Sinistra kneeled, on one knee, before\nMinerva McGonagall, presenting to her the Sorting Hat in both\nhands.",
      "Minerva McGonagall took the Sorting Hat from Professor\nSinistra's hands, and placed it on her own head.",
      "There was a long silence.",
      "\"HEADMISTRESS!\"",
      "\"As Albus Dumbledore is not dead,\" Minerva said, her voice so\nlow that students strained to hear it, \"but only taken from us, I\naccept this position in the capacity of Acting Headmistress only -\nuntil Dumbledore's return.\"",
      "A piercing cry split the Great Hall, and Fawkes was there,\noverflying all Four Tables in a slow spiral arc. He passed over\neach of the tables, humming in his bird's voice, a hum of absolute\nloyalty that would outlast the death of merely physical fires.\nWait, the hum seemed to say. Wait until his return,\nand be true.",
      "Fawkes circled Minerva McGonagall three times, feathered wings\nbrushing around her as the tears began to creep down her cheeks;\nthen the bird flew out a window above the Hall, and was gone.",

      "Harry had declined to give the eulogy. He'd declined for the\nsecond time. Professor Flitwick had asked him about it weeks ago in\nMay, to give Harry time to write his lines before it would become\nnecessary to speak; and Harry had said no then, too.",
      "So it fell to a sixth-year Gryffindor, Oliver Habryka, who had\nthe fourth-highest total of Quirrell points among all the students,\nand who had been General of an army. The seventeen-year-old boy was\ntall and not especially handsome in solid black robes; instead of a\nred tie, he was wearing a purple tie such as Professor Quirrell had\nsometimes favored.",
      "Speaking, under the circumstances, ex tempore. The\nprevious eulogies, written well in advance, had been discarded;\nOliver Habryka had a parchment in his left hand, but he wasn't\nlooking at it at all.",
      "\"Professor Quirrell was very sick,\" the tall boy said, his\nwavering voice falling into a hush of students, occasionally broken\nby a muffled sob. \"I think if Professor Quirrell had been able to\nfight in the fullness of his power, You-Know-Who couldn't have beat\nhim easily, and maybe not at all. They say that David Monroe was\nthe only one that You-Know-Who was ever afraid of, in his day.\nBut,\" Oliver's voice broke, \"Professor Quirrell wasn't in the\nfullness of his power. He was very sick. He had trouble walking by\nhimself. And he went to face the Dark Lord, alone.\"",
      "There was a pause, then, while the students cried for a\nwhile.",
      "Oliver wiped away his tears with his sleeve, and spoke again.\n\"We don't know exactly what happened,\" said Oliver. \"I imagine the\nDark Lord laughed at him. Maybe made fun of the Professor, for\nchallenging him when he couldn't stand up. Well, he's not\nlaughing now, is he.\"",
      "There were fierce nods from the students; all of them that Harry\ncould see, from Gryffindor to Slytherin.",

Maybe he\noffered Professor Quirrell his life if Professor Quirrell would\nserve him. Professor Quirrell smiled, and told the Dark Lord it was\ntime for them to play a game called Who's The Most Dangerous Wizard\nIn The World.\"",
      "If you don't know, don't just make stuff up. But Harry\ndidn't say anything. It was what Lord Voldemort might have tried,\nit was what Professor Quirrell might have said back.",
      "\"And they aren't telling us everything,\" Oliver said, \"but we\ncan guess what happened next. We all know that Hermione Granger,\nwho was one of the Professor's best students, was killed by a troll\nearlier this year, it must have been the Dark Lord who made it\nhappen, just like he framed her for the Blood-Cooling Charm.\nProfessor Quirrell knew the Dark Lord was behind it, so he stole\nMiss Granger's body and preserved it, kept it safe -\"",
      "Couldn't blame him for that one.",
      "\"Then Professor Quirrell went out to face the Dark Lord. The\nDark Lord killed Professor Quirrell. And Hermione Granger came back\nto life. They say she's alive and whole now, and maybe something\nmore. When the Dark Lord tried to seize her, all that was left of\nhim afterward was his burned robes and his hands around Miss\nGranger's throat. Just as Harry Potter was protected from the\nKilling Curse by his mother's love and sacrifice, Professor\nQuirrell willingly going out, to face, the Dark Lord alone, must\nhave called, Hermione Granger's spirit, back from, from wherever,\nshe was -\" Oliver's voice was breaking.",
      "\"Not just like that,\" Harry said from the front row of seats,\nhis own voice hoarse. He had to say something at this\npoint, before it got out of control. If it wasn't already out of\ncontrol. \"David Monroe was a powerful wizard, more powerful than\nanyone knew except him and me. I don't think you can bring someone\nback from the dead just by sacrificing yourself. No one should try\ndoing it that way.\"",
      "Such a beautiful story. It should have been true. It should\nhave been true.",
      "\"I don't know very much about the person behind the Professor,\"\nOliver Habryka said, after he got himself under control again. \"I\nknow David Monroe wasn't a happy man. He never could cast a\nPatronus Charm.\"",
      "Tears were gathering in Harry's eyes again. It wasn't right, it\nwasn't fair, Voldemort had killed so many people, he should have\ndied along with his followers, he didn't deserve special treatment.\nBut it hadn't just been Harry's weakness, it had been the\nhorcruxes, Voldemort couldn't have been killed outright.\nSo Harry could admit it, he was glad, he was glad\nProfessor Quirrell wasn't all gone...",
      "\"But I, know,\" said Oliver, tears glistening on his own cheeks,\n\"Professor Quirrell, is happy, wherever, he is now.\"",
      "On Harry's left hand, a tiny emerald glowed bright beneath the\nmorning sun.",
      "Not Heaven, not some faraway star, not a different place but\na better person, I'll show you, someday I'll show you how to be\nhappy -",
      "The tall boy glanced down at a parchment he held in his other\nhand, the first time he'd consulted it. \"Professor Quirrell,\"\nOliver said, his voice now fiercer and faster, \"was, by far, the\nbest Professor of Battle Magic that Hogwarts ever had. Salazar\nSlytherin couldn't have been half as good a teacher, no matter what\nspells he knew. Professor Quirrell told us at the beginning of this\nyear that what he taught us would always be our firm foundation in\nthe arts of Defense. And it will be. Forever. We'll teach it to the\nnew students next year, no matter who we have for a professor. The\nolder students will teach the younger ones. That's the solution to\nthe curse on the Defense position. We won't sit around waiting for\nauthority to teach us. And we'll make sure that Professor\nQuirrell's teachings never die out of Hogwarts.\"",
      "Harry looked at where Professor - no, Headmistress McGonagall -\nwas sitting, and saw the Headmistress nodding silently, a look that\nwas sad and stern and proud.",
      "\"They haven't let us see Miss Granger yet,\" Oliver said. His\nvoice quavered. \"The Girl-Who-Revived. But I'll always think of the\nDefense Professor when I see her. His sacrifice lives on in her,\njust as his teachings live on in us.\" Oliver glanced at where Harry\nsat, then looked down again at the parchment. \"Here's to Professor\nQuirrell, then, the best Slytherin that ever was, what every\nSlytherin should be! Three cheers for him!\"",
      "\"Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!\"",
      "No one stayed silent this time, not a single student that Harry\ncould see.",

      "Harry stood now before the gargoyles that guarded the\nHeadmaster's - no, the Headmistress's office. He had been summoned\nby Professor Sinistra, told that it was an emergency, but the gates\nwere not opening for him.",
      "Experiment had showed that the Stone made one Transfiguration\npermanent every three minutes and fifty-four seconds, irrespective\nof the size of object Transfigured. Just once, holding the\nPhilosopher's Stone up to the light of Harry's most powerful\nflashlight in an otherwise darkened closet, Harry had thought he'd\nseen an array of tiny points inside the chunk of crimson glass; but\nHarry hadn't been able to see it again, and now suspected himself\nof having imagined it. The Stone had no other powers that Harry\ncould detect, nor did it respond to any attempted mental\ncommands.",
      "Harry had given himself until noon tomorrow to figure out how to\nbegin using the Stone without it being grabbed by someone else,\ntrying not to think about what was still happening, what had always\nbeen happening, in the meanwhile.",
      "Ten minutes late, Minerva McGonagall approached, moving in a\nswift stride. Her arms were full of papers, she was once again\nwearing the Sorting Hat.",
      "The gargoyles, with a brief sound of grinding stone, bowed low\nbefore her.",
      "\"The new password is 'Impermanence',\" Minerva said to the\ngargoyles, and they stepped aside. \"I'm sorry, Mr. Potter, I was\ndelayed -\"",
      "\"Understood.\"",
      "Minerva mounted the long spiral stairs, climbing instead of\nwaiting to be carried, Harry following behind her.",
      "\"We are meeting with Amelia Bones, Director of the Department of\nMagical Law Enforcement; with Alastor Moody, whom you have met; and\nwith Bartemius Crouch, Director of the Department of International\nMagical Cooperation,\" Minerva said as she climbed. \"They are\nDumbledore's heirs as much as you or I.\"",
      "\"How - how's Hermione doing?\" Harry hadn't had a chance to ask\nuntil now.",
      "\"Filius said she seemed rather in shock, which I suppose is not\nsurprising. She asked where you were, was told you were at a\nQuidditch game, asked where you really were, and refused to speak\nwith anyone about what happened until she was allowed to talk with\nyou. She was taken to St. Mungo's, where,\" the Headmistress now\nsounded slightly perturbed, \"a standard diagnostic Charm showed\nMiss Granger as a healthy unicorn in excellent physical condition\nexcept that her mane needs combing. Charms to detect active magic\nhave each time detected her as being in the process of transforming\ninto another shape. There was an Unspeakable who showed up before\nFilius, ah, removed him. He performed certain spells he probably\nought not to have known, and declared that Hermione's soul was in\nhealthy condition but at least a mile away from her body. At that\npoint the senior healers gave up. She's currently alone in a cell\nwith the rats and flies -\"",
      "\"She's what?\"",
      "\"I'm sorry, Mr. Potter, that's Transfiguration jargon. Miss\nGranger is in an isolation chamber with a cage of tame rats, and a\nbox of flies that will bear offspring in a single day. Logic\nsuggests that whatever mystery underlies her resurrection, it left\nbehind an emanation that is causing the healers' Charms to produce\ngibberish. But if nothing happens to the rats or to the flies'\noffspring, Miss Granger will be declared safe to return to Hogwarts\nafter she wakes up again tomorrow morning.\"",
      "Harry still wasn't sure... wasn't sure at all, what\nHermione would think of having been resurrected, at least under\nthese particular circumstances. He didn't actually think Hermione\nwould yell at him for doing it wrong. That was just Harry's brain\ntrying to imagine her as a stereotype. Harry had been legitimately\nexhausted and not thinking very straight when he'd come up with\nthat cover story, and Hermione would probably understand that part.\nBut he couldn't imagine what Hermione would think...",
      "\"I wonder how Miss Granger will feel about having also\nvanquished You-Know-Who,\" Minerva said reflectively, climbing the\nmoving stairs fast enough that Harry felt out of breath trying to\nkeep up. \"And people believing the most interesting things about\nher.\"",
      "\"You mean, because she's always self-identified as a normal\nacademic genius, and now a bunch of people think of her as the\nGirl-Who-Revived and everyone wants to shake her hand?\" Harry said.\nEven though she doesn't remember doing anything to earn it.\nEven though it was all someone else's work and other people's\nsacrifices, and she's getting the credit. Even though she doesn't\nfeel like she's actually done anything worthy of the way other\npeople treat her, and she's not sure if she can ever live up to the\nperson they imagine. \"Gosh, I don't know, I can't imagine what\nthat feels like.\"",
      "Maybe I shouldn't have subjected her to it. But people had\nto be given something to believe or heaven knows what\nthey'd have made up. Feeling guilty about this would be stupid. I\nthink.",
      "The two of them reached the top of the stairs, and came into the\noffice filled with dozens of strange objects, all facing a great\ndesk and a mighty throne behind it.",
      "Minerva's hand passed over one of those objects, the one with\ngolden wibblers, her eyes closing briefly. Then Minerva took off\nthe Sorting Hat and put it on a hatrack that held three slippers\nfor left feet. She transformed the mighty throne into a simple\ncushioned chair and the great desk into a round table, around which\nfour other chairs rose up.",
      "Harry watched it all with a strange pang in his throat. He knew,\nwithout either of them saying anything, that there should have been\nmore ceremony for the changing of the chairs, the changing of the\ntable. Much more ceremony, for the first time the Headmistress sat\ndown in her new office. But for whatever reason, there wasn't time,\nand Minerva McGonagall was discarding all that for speed.",
      "A wave of Minerva's wand lit the Floo-fire in the fireplace,\neven as Minerva sat down into the chair that had been\nDumbledore's.",
      "Harry quietly took one of the chairs around the table, sitting\nat Minerva's left.",
      "Almost at once, the Floo-fire burned emeraldine and whirled out\nAlastor Moody, who spun around with his wand raised, taking in the\nwhole room at a seeming glance, and then pointed his wand directly\nat Harry and said \"Avada Kedavra.\"",
      "It happened so fast, and took him so completely by surprise,\nthat Harry's wand wasn't even half-raised by the time Alastor Moody\nfinished the incantation.",
      "\"Just checking,\" Alastor said to the Headmistress, whose own\nwand was now pointed at Alastor, her mouth open as if to say words\nshe couldn't find. \"Voldie would've tried to dodge, if he'd taken\nover the boy's body last night. I'll still need to check the\nGranger girl, though.\" Alastor Moody went to Minerva's right and\nsat down.",
      "Harry had thought, in that split second, to try producing a\nwordless silver Patronus glow from his wand; but his wand hadn't\nbeen in place to intercept in time, not even close.",
      "Well, if I was feeling invincible before, that does for\nthat. What a valuable life lesson, Mr. Moody.",
      "Then the Floo-fire burned green again, and spat out the oldest,\ngrimmest, toughest-looking witch Harry had ever seen, like beef\njerky given human shape. The old witch did not have her wand in her\nhand, but she projected an air of authority that was stronger and\nstricter than Dumbledore's.",
      "\"This is Director Amelia Bones, Mr. Potter,\" said Headmistress\nMcGonagall, who'd regained her poise. \"We are still waiting on\nDirector Crouch -\"",
      "\"The corpse of Bartemius Crouch Jr. was identified among the\ndead Death Eaters,\" the old witch said without preamble, even as\nshe continued toward the chairs. \"It took us entirely by surprise,\nand I'm afraid Bartemius is in considerable grief about it, on both\ncounts. He will not be with us today.\"",
      "Harry kept the flinch inward.",
      "Amelia Bones sat down in a chair, sitting to Moody's own\nright.",
      "\"Headmistress McGonagall,\" said the elder witch, still without\nhesitation or delay, \"The Line of Merlin Unbroken, which Dumbledore\nleft to me in regency, is not responding to my hand. The Wizengamot\nmust have a Chief Warlock who is trustworthy, at once;\nmatters are in great flux in Britain. I must know what Dumbledore\nhas done, immediately!\"",
      "\"Crap,\" muttered Moody. His mad-eye was rolling wildly. \"That's\nnot good, not good at all.\"",
      "\"Yes, well,\" said Minerva McGonagall, who looked rather\napprehensive. \"I cannot say that for certain. Albus - well, he\nclearly had an intimation that he might not survive this war. But I\ndo not think he was expecting Miss Granger to come back from the\ndead and kill Voldemort only hours later. I do not think Albus was\nexpecting that at all. I am not quite sure what his legacies will\nmake of that -\"",
      "Amelia Bones rose half out of her chair. \"You mean to imply that\nthe Granger girl may have inherited the Line of Merlin\nUnbroken? This is a catastrophe! She is twelve years old,\nuntested - surely Albus would not be so irresponsible as to leave\nthe Line to whoever happened to defeat Voldemort, without knowing\nwho!\"",
      "\"Well, putting it simply,\" Minerva said. Her fingers squared the\npaperwork she'd taken with her, now lying on the desk. \"Albus\ndid think he knew who would defeat Voldemort. There was a\nprophecy concerning it, a verified one, which now seems to be in\nabeyance, or - I don't know, Madam Bones! I have one letter for Mr.\nPotter that I am to give him in the event of Albus's death or other\ndeparture, and then another letter that Albus said Mr. Potter would\nbe able to open only after he defeated Voldemort. I am not sure\nwhat will happen to it now. Perhaps Miss Granger will be able to\nopen it, or perhaps it can never be opened -\"",
      "\"Hold up,\" Mad-Eye Moody said. He reached into his robes, drew\nout a long, grey-knobbed wand that Harry recognized; it was\nDumbledore's wand, of a form and style not like any other wand in\nHogwarts. Moody laid the wand on the table. \"Before we go any\nfurther, Albus left me an instruction or two of his own. Pick up\nthis wand, boy.\"",
      "Harry hesitated, thinking.",
      "Albus Dumbledore sacrificed himself for me. He trusted\nMoody. This probably isn't a trap.",
      "Then Harry began to reach for the wand.",
      "It leaped up and flew across the table, into Harry's hand. And\nthe moment that Harry's fingers grasped the handle it was like he\nheard a song, a paean of glory and battle that resonated in his\nmind. A wave of white fire ran up the handle and over the wood,\nmagnifying as it moved, bursting from the end in a tremendous spray\nof sparks. Through the wood beneath his fingers ran a sense of\nstrength and constrained danger, like a leashed wolf.",
      "Harry was also receiving an impression of distinct skepticism,\nas if the wand had some level of awareness, and it was wondering\nhow the hell it had ended up being held by a Hogwarts\nfirst-year.",
      "\"Right,\" said Mad-Eye Moody into the puzzled stares. \"So it\nwasn't Miss Granger who defeated Voldie, then. Didn't think\nso.\"",
      "\"What.\" Amelia Bones spoke the word flatly.",
      "Mad-Eye Moody gave her a respectful nod. \"Albus said this wand\ngoes to whoever defeats its previous master. Took it off old\nGrindie, he did. Then Voldie defeated Albus, yesterday. Do I need\nto spell it out, Amelia?\"",
      "Amelia Bones was staring at Harry, her mouth wide open.",
      "\"That might not be right,\" Harry said. He swallowed another pang\nof the awful guilt. \"I mean, Voldemort used me as a hostage because\nI, I was stupid, and Dumbledore gave himself up to save me, maybe\nthe wand thinks that counts as my defeating Dumbledore. Um, I did\ndefeat Voldemort, though. Vanquished him. But I think it's better\nif nobody has any idea I was there.\"",
      "Beep. Tick. Whirr. Ding. Poot.",
      "\"That must have taken some doing,\" Mad-Eye\nsaid. The scarred man inclined his head slowly, a gesture of\nprofound respect. \"Don't feel too guilty about losing Albus and\nDavid and Flamel, son, no matter how stupid you were. You won in\nthe end. All of us put together never could. Just to check, son,\nyou and David also destroyed Voldie's horcrux? And you're\ncertain it was the real thing?\"",
      "Harry hesitated, weighing up the probable consequences of trust,\nthe possible disasters of silence, and then shook his head to Moody\nin reply. He'd been planning to tell at least McGonagall about what\nwas now inside her school, anyway. \"Voldemort had... rather a lot\nof horcruxes, actually. So instead I Obliviated most of his\nmemories, then Transfigured him into this.\" Harry raised his hand,\nand silently pointed to the emerald on his ring.",
      "Splat. Boing. Splat. Splat.",
      "\"Huh,\" Moody said, leaning back in his chair. \"Minerva and I\nwill be putting some alarms and enchantments on that ring of yours,\nson, if you don't mind. Just in case you forget to sustain that\nTransfiguration one day. And don't go hunting any other Dark\nwizards, ever, just live a quiet and peaceful life.\" The scarred\nman took a handkerchief and wiped at the beads of sweat that had\nnow appeared on his forehead. \"But well done, lad, you and David\nboth, may he rest in peace. This was his idea, I'm guessing? Well\ndone, I say.\"",
      "\"Indeed,\" said Amelia Bones, who had now regained her composure.\n\"We all owe the both of you a tremendous debt of gratitude. But I\nsay again that there is urgent business regarding the Line of\nMerlin Unbroken.\"",
      "\"I believe,\" Minerva McGonagall said slowly, \"that I had best\ngive Albus's letters to Mr. Potter, right now.\" At the top of her\nstack of papers now lay a parchment envelope, and a rolled-up\nparchment scroll sealed with a grey ribbon.",
      "The Headmistress gave Harry the parchment envelope, first, and\nHarry opened it.",
      "If you are reading this, Harry Potter, then I have fallen to\nVoldemort, and the quest now lies in your hands.",
      "Though it may shock you to learn, this was the end that I\nwished in my heart would come to pass. For as I write this, it yet\nseems possible that Voldemort may fall by my own hand. And then, in\ntime, I shall myself become the darkness you must overcome, to\nenter fully into your power. For it was said once that you might\nneed to raise your hand against your mentor, the one who made you,\nwho you loved; it was said that you might be my downfall. If you\nare reading this, then that shall never come to pass, and I am glad\nof it.",
      "Even so, Harry, I would spare you this, the lonely fight\nagainst Voldemort. I write this, vowing to shelter you as long as I\ncan, no matter the final cost to myself. But if I have failed, then\nknow that I am glad of it, in my own selfish way.",
      "With my passing, there is none left to oppose Voldemort as\nan equal save you. His shadow will fall long and terrible over\nmagical Britain, and many will suffer and die for it. That shadow\nwill not lift until you destroy its source, until you cleanse the\nheart of the darkness. How you are to do this, I do not know. If\nVoldemort knows not the power you bear, then neither do I. You must\nfind that power within yourself, you must learn to wield it, you\nmust become Voldemort's final judge, and I beg you not to make the\nerror of showing him mercy.",
      "My wand, which I have left to you in Moody's keeping, you\nmust not dare to wield against Voldemort. For when that wand's\nmaster is defeated, it passes to the victor in turn. When you have\nconquered my conqueror, then the wand will answer truly to your\nhand; but if you try to turn it against Voldemort before then, it\nwill betray you for certain. Keep it out of Voldemort's grasp at\nall costs. I should advise you not to wield that wand at all, yet\nit is a device of great power, which you might need in some\ndesperate case. But if you pick it up you must fear its treachery\nat all times.",
      "In my absence, the Wizengamot will inevitably fall to\nMalfoy. The Line of Merlin Unbroken I have passed to you, with\nAmelia Bones as your regent, until you come of age or come into\nyour power. But she cannot oppose Malfoy for long, not with myself\ngone and Voldemort returned to advise him. Soon, I think, the\nMinistry will fall, and Hogwarts will become the last fortress. To\nMinerva I have left Hogwarts's keys, but you alone are its prince,\nand she will help you however she can.",
      "Alastor now leads the Order of the Phoenix. Heed his words\nwell, both his advice and his confidences. It is one of my life's\ngreatest regrets that I did not heed Alastor more and\nsooner.",
      "That you will in the end defeat Voldemort, I have no\ndoubt.",
      "For that will be only the beginning of your life's destiny.\nOf that, too, I am certain.",
      "When you have vanquished Voldemort, when you have saved this\ncountry, then, I hope, you may embark upon the true meaning of your\ndays.",
      "Hurry then to begin.",
      "Yours in death (or in whatever),",
      "Dumbledore.",
      "P.S. The passwords are 'phoenix's price', 'phoenix's fate',\nand 'phoenix's egg', spoken within my office. Minerva can move\nthose rooms to where you can reach them more easily.",
      "Harry folded up the parchment and put its back into the\nenvelope, frowning thoughtfully, then took the grey-ribboned scroll\nfrom the Headmistress. When the long grey wand in Harry's hand\ntouched the ribbon, it fell away at once; and Harry unrolled the\nscroll, and read it.",
      "Dear Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres:",
      "If you are reading this, you have defeated\nVoldemort.",
      "Congratulations on that.",
      "I hope you had some time in which to celebrate before you\nopened this scroll, because the news in it is not\ncheerful.",
      "During the First Wizarding War, there came a time when I\nrealised that Voldemort was winning, that he would soon hold all\nwithin his hand.",
      "In that extremity, I went into the Department of Mysteries\nand I invoked a password which had never been spoken in the history\nof the Line of Merlin Unbroken, did a thing forbidden and yet not\nutterly forbidden.",
      "I listened to every prophecy that had ever been\nrecorded.",
      "And so I learned that my troubles were far worse than\nVoldemort.",
      "From certain seers and diviners have come an increasing\nchorus of foretellings that this world is doomed to\ndestruction.",
      "And you, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, are one of those\nforetold to destroy it.",
      "By rights I should have ended your line of possibility,\nstopped you from ever being born, as I did my best to end all the\nother possibilities I discovered on that day of terrible\nawakening.",
      "Yet in your case, Harry, and in your case alone, the\nprophecies of your apocalypse have loopholes, though those\nloopholes be ever so slight.",
      "Always 'he will end the world', not 'he will end\nlife'.",
      "Even when it was said that you would tear apart the very\nstars in heaven, it was not said that you would tear apart the\npeople.",
      "And so, it being clear that this world is not meant to last,\nI have gambled literally everything upon you, Harry James\nPotter-Evans-Verres. There were no prophecies of how the world\nmight be saved, so I found the prophecies that offered loopholes in\nthe destruction; and I brought about the strange and complex\nconditions for those prophecies to come to pass. I ensured that\nVoldemort discovered a certain one of those prophecies, and so\n(even as I had feared) condemned your parents to death and made you\nwhat you are. I wrote a strange hint in your mother's Potions\ntextbook, having no idea why I must; and this proved to show Lily\nhow to help her sister, and ensured you would gain Petunia Evans's\nheartfelt love. I snuck invisibly into your bedroom in Oxford and\nadministered the potion that is given to students with\nTime-Turners, to extend your day's cycle by two hours. When you\nwere six years old I smashed a rock that was on your windowsill,\nand to this day I cannot imagine why.",
      "All in the desperate hope that you can pass us through the\neye of the storm, somehow end this world and yet bring out its\npeople alive.",
      "Now that you have passed the preliminary test of defeating\nVoldemort, I place my all in your hands, all the tools I can\npossibly give you. The Line of Merlin Unbroken, the command of the\nOrder of the Phoenix, all my wealth and all my treasures, the Elder\nWand out of the Deathly Hallows, the loyalty of such of my friends\nas may heed me. I have left Hogwarts in Minerva's care, for I do\nnot think you will have time for it, but even that is yours if you\ndemand it from her.",
      "One thing I do not give you, and that is the prophecies.\nUpon the moment of my departure, they will be destroyed, and no\nfuture ones will be recorded, for it was said that you must not\nlook upon them. If you think this frustrating, believe me when I\nsay that even your wit cannot comprehend what frustration you have\nbeen spared. I will die, or be lost by you, or in some other way be\ntaken from you - the prophecies are unclear, naturally - without\never once knowing what the future truly holds, or why I must do\nwhat I do. It is all cryptic madness and you are well rid of\nit.",
      "There can only be one king upon the chessboard.",
      "There can only be one piece whose value is beyond\nprice.",
      "That piece is not the world, it is the world's peoples,\nwizard and Muggle alike, goblins and house-elves and all.",
      "While survives any remnant of our kind, that piece is yet in\nplay, though the stars should die in heaven.",
      "And if that piece be lost, the game ends.",
      "Know the value of all your other pieces, and play to\nwin.",
      "- Albus",
      "Harry held the parchment scroll for a long time, staring at\nnothing.",
      "So.",
      "There were times when the phrase 'That explains it' didn't\nreally seem to cover it, but nonetheless, that explained it.",
      "Absently Harry rolled up the parchment scroll in his fist, still\nstaring at nothing.",
      "\"What does it say?\" said Amelia Bones.",
      "\"It's a confession letter,\" Harry said. \"Turns out Dumbledore's\nthe one who killed my pet rock.\"",
      "\"This is not a time for jokes!\u202f\" cried the elder witch.\n\"Are you the true holder of the Line of Merlin Unbroken?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Harry said absently, his mind occupied with thoughts that\nwere, by any objective quantification, overwhelmingly more\nimportant.",
      "The old witch was sitting very still in her chair. She turned\nher head, and locked eyes with Minerva McGonagall.",
      "Meanwhile Harry's brain, which was juggling way too many\npossibilities over way too many time horizons, some of them\ninvolving literally billions of years and stellar disassembly\nprocedures, declared cognitive bankruptcy and started over. All\nright, what's the first thing I have to do to save the\nworld... no, make it even more local, what do I have to do\ntoday... besides figuring out what to do, that is, and I'd\nbetter not delay before looking at whatever Dumbledore left me in\nthe Phoenix's Egg room...",
      "Harry raised his eyes from the rolled-up parchment and looked at\nProfessor- at Headmistress McGonagall, at Mad-Eye Moody, and at the\nleathery-looking old witch, as though seeing them for the first\ntime. Though he was in fact seeing Amelia Bones for mostly the\nfirst time.",
      "Amelia Bones, head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement,\nwhom Albus Dumbledore had thought worthy to lead the Wizengamot at\nleast temporarily. Her cooperation would be invaluable, maybe\nnecessary, for... for whatever was headed Harry's way.\nDumbledore had chosen her, and he'd read prophecies Harry hadn't\nseen.",
      "Amelia Bones, who had thought she'd been appointed regent over\nthe Line of Merlin Unbroken and made the next Chief Warlock, only\nto find that instead the position had gone to, apparently, an\neleven-year-old boy.",
      "You will now, said the voice of Hufflepuff inside his\nhead, you will now be polite. You will not be your usual brand\nof bloody idiot. Because the fate of the world might just depend on\nit. Or not. We don't even know.",
      "\"I'm terribly sorry about all this,\" Harry Potter said, then\npaused to see what effect, if any, this polite statement had\nproduced.",
      "\"Minerva seems to think,\" the old witch said, \"that you will not\ntake offense to honest words.\"",
      "Harry nodded. His Ravenclaw part wanted to include the\ndisclaimer about that being different from people blatantly trying\nto push you down while crying that you were intolerant of\ncriticism, but Hufflepuff vetoed. Whatever she had to say, Harry\nwould hear.",
      "\"I do not wish to speak ill of the departed,\" the old witch\nsaid. \"But since time immemorial, the Line of Merlin Unbroken has\npassed to those who have thoroughly demonstrated\nthemselves to be, not only good people, but wise enough to\ndistinguish successors who are themselves both good and wise. A\nsingle break, anywhere along the chain, and the succession might go\nastray and never return! It was a mad act for Dumbledore to pass\nthe Line to you at such a young age, even having made it\nconditional upon your defeat of You-Know-Who. A tarnish upon\nDumbledore's legacy, that is how it will be seen.\" The old witch\nhesitated, her eyes still watching Harry. \"I think it best that\nnobody outside this room ever learn of it.\"",
      "\"Um,\" Harry said. \"You... don't think very much of Dumbledore, I\ntake it?\"",
      "\"I thought...\" said the old witch. \"Well. Albus Dumbledore was a\nbetter wizard than I, a better person than I, in more ways\nthan I can easily count. But the man had his faults.\"",
      "\"Because, um. I mean. Dumbledore knew everything you\njust said. About my being young and how the Line works. You're\nacting like you think Dumbledore was unaware of those facts, or\njust ignoring them, when he made his decision. It's true that\nsometimes stupid people, like me, make decisions that crazy. But\nnot Dumbledore. He was not mad.\" Harry swallowed, forcing\na sudden moisture away from his eyes. \"I think... I'm beginning to\nrealize... Dumbledore was the only sane person, in all of this, all\nalong. The only one who was doing the right things for\nanything like the right reasons...\"",
      "Madam Bones was cursing under her breath, low dire imprecations\nthat were making Minerva McGonagall twitch.",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" Harry said helplessly.",
      "Mad-Eye was grinning, the scarred face twisting up in a smile.\n\"Always knew Albus was up to something he never told the\nrest of us. Lad, you have no idea how hard it is for me not to use\nmy Eye on that scroll.\"",
      "Harry quickly shoved the scroll into his mokeskin pouch.",
      "\"Alastor,\" Amelia said. The old witch's voice was rising. \"You\nare a man of sense, you cannot think the lad is able to fill\nDumbledore's socks! Not today!\u202f\"",
      "\"Dumbledore,\" Harry said, the name tasting strange on his\ntongue, \"did make one wrong assumption, when he made his decisions.\nHe thought we'd be fighting Voldemort for years, all of us\ntogether. He didn't know I'd vanquish Voldemort immediately. It was\nthe right thing for me to do, it saved a lot of lives compared to\nfighting a long battle. But Dumbledore thought you would have years\nto learn me, trust me... and instead it was all over in an\nevening.\" Harry inhaled. \"Can't you just pretend we've\nbeen fighting Voldemort for years and I earned your trust and\neverything? So that I'm not penalised for winning more quickly than\nDumbledore expected?\"",
      "\"You are still a first-year in Hogwarts!\" the old witch said.\n\"You cannot take Dumbledore's place, whatever his\nintentions!\"",
      "\"Right, that whole 'looking like an eleven-year-old' thing.\"\nHarry's hand came up, rubbed at his nose where his glasses lay.\nI suppose I could just use the Stone, change myself to look\nlike ninety...",
      "\"I am not a fool,\" the old witch said. \"I know you are no\nordinary child. I have seen you speak to Lucius Malfoy, watched you\nfrighten off a Dementor, and witnessed Fawkes grant your plea.\nAnyone with wisdom who saw you before the Wizengamot - by which I\nmean myself and at most two others - could guess that you had\nabsorbed some portion of You-Know-Who's shredded soul on the night\nof his undeath, but subdued it and turned his knowledge to good\nends.\"",
      "There was a slight pause in the room.",
      "\"Well, yes, of course,\" said Minerva McGonagall. She sighed,\nslumped a bit in the Headmistress's chair. \"As Albus clearly knew\nfrom the very beginning, but thoughtfully declined to warn\nme about in any way whatsoever.\"",
      "\"Right,\" Moody said. \"I knew that. Yep. Perfectly obvious.\nWasn't confused at all.\"",
      "\"I guess that's close enough to the truth,\" said Harry. \"So, um.\nWhat's the problem, exactly?\"",
      "\"The problem,\" Amelia Bones said, her voice perfectly even, \"is\nthat you are a bubbling, unstable blend of a Hogwarts first-year\nand You-Know-Who.\" She paused, as though waiting for something.",
      "\"I'm getting better about that,\" Harry said, since she seemed to\nbe waiting on his reply. \"Quite rapidly, in fact. More importantly,\nit's not something Dumbledore didn't know.\"",
      "The old witch continued. \"Giving away your fortune and going in\ndebt to Lucius Malfoy to keep your best friend out of Azkaban, as\nmuch as it demonstrates your upstanding moral character, also\ndemonstrates that you cannot corral the Wizengamot. I can see now\nthat you did the right thing for yourself, the thing you had to do\nto maintain your lease on sanity and hold back your inner darkness.\nBut you also did a thing that Merlin's heir must not do. A\nsentimental leader can be far worse than a selfish one. Albus,\nmaster and servant of a phoenix, was barely survivable - and even\nhe opposed you that day.\" Amelia gestured in the direction of\nMad-Eye Moody. \"Alastor has hardness. He has cunning. He still does\nnot have the talent for government. You, Harry Potter, do not yet\nhave the sternness, the capacity for sacrifice, to direct even the\nOrder of the Phoenix. And being what you are, you must not\ntry to become that person. Not now, not at your age. Align and\nfuse your divided soul in your own time, if you possibly can. Do\nnot try to be Chief Warlock while you are doing it. If Albus\nthought that was a good idea, he was crafting a nicer story at the\nexpense of real-world practicality. I do think the man had a\nproblem with that.\"",
      "Harry's eyes were a bit wide, listening to all this. \"Um... what\nexactly do you think is going on in here?\" Harry tapped his head\njust above his ear.",
      "\"I imagine that inside you is the soul of a boy who remains\nhonest and true, gathering his will to force down the fragment of\nVoldemort's spirit that tries to consume him, even as it howls at\nhim that he is sentimental and weak - did you just giggle?\"",
      "\"Sorry. But seriously, it wasn't ever that bad. More\nlike having a lot of bad habits I needed to break.\"",
      "\"Ahem,\" said Headmistress McGonagall. \"Mr. Potter, I think at\nthe start of this year it was that bad.\"",
      "\"Bad habits that chained into and triggered each other. Yes,\nthose are a bit more of a problem.\" Harry sighed. \"And you, Madam\nBones... er. Sorry if I'm wrong about this. But my guess is that\nyou're feeling a bit upset that the Line went to an\neleven-year-old?\"",
      "\"Not the way you are thinking,\" the old witch said calmly.\n\"Though it is natural for you to suspect me. The position of Chief\nWarlock is not one I will find pleasant, even compared to the\nhorrors of Magical Law Enforcement. Albus persuaded me on the\nmatter, and I would say that I took some convincing, but the truth\nis that I did not waste his time in an argument I expected to lose.\nI knew I would hate the task, and I knew I would do it anyway.\nMinerva says you have some amount of common sense, especially when\nothers remind you of it. Can you really see yourself standing upon\nthe Wizengamot's high dais? Are you sure it is not some remnant of\nYou-Know-Who that imagines himself suited to the position, or even\ndesires it at all?\"",
      "Harry took off his glasses and massaged his forehead. His scar\nstill ached a bit, from the damage he'd done by picking at it\nyesterday until it bled in a suitably dramatic fashion. \"I do have\nsome common sense, and yes, being Chief Warlock sounds like a huge\namount of aggravation and a job that, in reality, does not fit me\nthe tiniest bit. The trouble is. Um. I'm not sure the Line of\nMerlin is just about being Chief Warlock. There's, um. I suspect...\nthat there's weird other stuff that goes along with it. And that\nDumbledore meant me to take responsibility for the... other stuff.\nAnd that the other stuff is... possibly quite amazingly\nimportant.\"",
      "\"Crap,\" Moody said. Then Alastor Moody repeated, \"Crap. Kid,\nshould you even be saying this to us?\"",
      "\"I don't know,\" Harry said. \"If there's a user manual, I haven't\nlooked at it yet.\"",
      "\"Crap.\"",
      "\"And if these other matters require sternness and sacrifice?\"\nAmelia Bones said, still camly. \"If they test you as you were\ntested before the Wizengamot? I am old, Harry Potter, and I am not\nwithout knowledge of mysteries. You have seen how I was able to\nperceive your own nature at nearly a glance.\"",
      "\"Amelia,\" Mad-Eye Moody said. \"What would have happened if you'd\nhad to fight You-Know-Who last night?\"",
      "The old witch shrugged. \"I would have died, I expect.\"",
      "\"You'd have lost,\" said Alastor Moody. \"And the\nBoy-Who-Lived didn't just take out Voldie, he set it up so that his\ngood friend Hermione Granger came back from the dead at\nthe same time Voldie resurrected himself. There's no way in hell or\ndouble hell that was an accident, and I don't think it was David's\nidea either. Amy, the truth is, none of us know what the keeper of\nMerlin's legacy has to do. But we're not the right kind of\ncrazy for this crap.\"",
      "Amelia Bones frowned. \"Alastor, you know I've dealt with strange\nthings before. Dealt with them quite well, in my opinion.\"",
      "\"Yeah. You dealt with the crap so you could go back to\nreal life. You're not the kind of crazy that builds a castle out of\nthe crap and lives there.\" Moody sighed. \"Amy, on some level you\nknow exactly why Albus had to leave who-knows-what-job to the poor\nkid.\"",
      "The old witch's fists clenched on the table. \"Do you have any\nidea of the disaster it would be for Britain? Call me\nsane, but I cannot accept that outcome! I have worked too long\ntoward this day to see it fall apart now, now of all\ntimes!\"",
      "\"Excuse me,\" Headmistress McGonagall said, sounding quite\nprecise and Scottish. \"Is there any reason why Mr. Potter cannot\nsimply instruct the Line that Madam Bones is his regent for the\nposition of Chief Warlock, but not anything having to do with the\nDepartment of Mysteries, until he comes of age? If Albus could tell\nthe Line to appoint a regent only until Voldemort's defeat, it is\nclearly capable of following complex orders.\"",
      "Slowly, this unexpected hammer-blow of common sense was absorbed\nby everyone present.",
      "Harry opened his mouth to agree to appoint Amelia Bones his\nregent for Wizengamot-related matters, and then hesitated\nagain.",
      "\"Um,\" Harry said. \"Um. Madam Bones, I would much prefer if you\ntook charge of handling the Wizengamot instead of me.\"",
      "\"In that we are agreed,\" said the old witch. \"Shall we let it be\ndone?\"",
      "\"But -\"",
      "There was a sort of frustrated dropping-back of the others.\n\"What is the problem, Mr. Potter?\" said the Headmistress, in a\nvoice that indicated she hoped it was nothing serious.",
      "\"Um. I think there's a couple of things I might have to do very\nsoon that could... prove politically controversial, and in exchange\nfor handing over the Line's political power to Madam Bones I'm\ngoing to want her... um, cooperation on some things.\"",
      "Amelia Bones exchanged another long stare with Minerva\nMcGonagall. Then she looked back at Harry Potter.",
      "\"I am indignant at your request!\" Amelia Bones said. \"Your\nhesitancy has told me that you are weak and unused to bargaining,\nand will probably fold if I push back.\"",
      "Harry closed his eyes.",
      "Slightly dark-tinged Harry opened them.",
      "\"All right,\" Harry said, \"let me rephrase. I don't mean to\ninterfere with your work on a day-to-day or even month-to-month\nbasis, but I can't just toss off the final responsibility that\nDumbledore left me. I'm not going to owl you bizarre parchments out\nof nowhere, there can be discussions first, but at some point I may\nhave to give you an order. If you refuse the order I might have to\ntake back the Line's Wizengamot functions and assume direct\ncontrol. Can you handle that?\"",
      "\"And if I say no?\" said the old witch.",
      "Slight, slight the dark tinge... \"I don't have an\nalternative to you lined up. I could start by asking Augusta\nLongbottom who she thought might be suitable and work from there.\nBut it may be important that we keep to Dumbledore's plan as much\nas possible, since I don't know exactly why he did the things he\ndid, and he thought Amelia Bones should be Chief Warlock for a\ntime. I'm not going to pull Merlin's name on you, but... no, strike\nthat, I am going to pull Merlin's name on you, this might\nor might not be insanely important.\"",
      "The old witch thought for a time, her eyes going from person to\nperson around the table. \"I am not satisfied with this,\" she said\nafter a time. \"But the Wizengamot must be called to order soon. It\nwill do for now.\"",
      "Slowly the old witch reached into her robes, and took out a\nshort rod of stone, dark stone.",
      "She placed the rod on the table before Harry. \"Take what is\nyours,\" she said. \"And then do please give it back.\"",
      "Harry reached out his hand to take it.",
      "In the moment that Harry's fingers first touched the dark stone\n-",
      "- nothing happened.",
      "Well, perhaps Merlin hadn't been given to melodrama. That could\nexplain why his final legacy looked like a small, unassuming dark\nrod. If that was all that was needed for its function, that would\nbe all that was there.",
      "Harry took up the Line, frowning at it. \"I'd like to appoint\nAmelia Bones as my regent for Wizengamot-related functions.\" Then,\nthe thought occurring to him that he needed to specify a stopping\npoint to define a regency, Harry added, \"Until I say that I've\ntaken it back.\"",
      "Then Harry made a face. He'd been hoping for more from the Line,\nbut it was just a key to places in the Department of Mysteries\nwhere interesting things were kept, or to seals where Merlin and\nhis successors had stashed things that shouldn't be destroyed but\nought to be kept from general circulation. Aside from that, the\nLine didn't do much.",
      "The Line didn't let you bypass the Interdict of Merlin either.\nNo, not even if the fate of the galaxy was at stake. Not even if\nthe person seemed sane, had taken an Unbreakable Vow, and honestly\nbelieved the world was about to be destroyed otherwise.",
      "Merlin had dreamed of a long run, a world that would last for\neons and not just centuries. The world had no reason not to last\nforever, if the truly dangerous powers were removed and\nkept gone. Conversely, a single loophole in the safeguards made the\nworld's destruction only a matter of time. Someday Merlin's Line\nwould pass to the wrong person. It could reject the obviously\nunworthy, but eventually it would pass into hands too subtly flawed\nfor the Line to detect. This was inevitable, when dealing with\nhuman beings, and Harry needed to keep that in mind before he\nsealed something where future Line-holders could retrieve it - the\ndisaster of its inevitable misuse someday needed to be\noutweighed by its benefits over the next few thousand years.",
      "Harry let out a sad small sigh, under his breath. Merlin,\nyou idiot...",
      "Thinking that didn't unlock any final safeguards.",
      "There wasn't anything currently on fire in the Department of\nMysteries, so Harry carefully placed the Line back on the\ntable.",
      "\"Thank you,\" the old witch said. She picked up the rod of dark\nstone. \"Do you know how I am to use it to call the Wizengamot to\norder, or - never mind, I shall just try striking the podium. That\nseems obvious enough. To the rest of the country, of course, I am\nthe Chief Warlock so far as anyone knows except us four.\"",
      "Harry hesitated. Then he imagined the owls he would receive if\nanyone knew he was allowed to second-guess the Chief Warlock, and\nwhat that would do to Amelia's negotiating power. \"Fine.\"",
      "Amelia tucked the rod back into her robes. \"I will not say it\nwas a pleasure doing business with you, Boy-Who-Lived, but it could\nhave been much worse. Thank you kindly for that.\"",
      "Harry was already feeling worried about the exact balance of\npower here, from the way Madam Bones was acting. The others had,\nquite logically, deduced that it had been mostly David Monroe who'd\nplanned the way to defeating Voldemort, which meant they were still\nunderestimating him. It might take a crisis of some type, with\nHarry figuring it out successfully for once instead of screwing up,\nbefore Amelia Bones started to respect his authority. Or believe in\nit at all, actually... \"So,\" Harry said. \"Any weirdness for me that\nyou would have brought to Dumbledore while he was around?\"",
      "Amelia looked thoughtful. \"Since you ask... I can think of three\nthings, indeed. First, we don't have the faintest notion what\nritual was used to sacrifice the Death Eaters and resurrect\nYou-Know-Who. It corresponds to no known legend, and the magic\ntraces from the ritual have been eradicated. So far as my Aurors\ncan tell, everyone's heads fell off their necks due to natural\ncauses. Except for Walden MacNair, who was killed by magical fire\nafter firing a Killing Curse from his wand. A very mysterious\nritual indeed.\" She was giving Harry Potter a rather\nprecise look.",
      "Harry considered this, choosing his words carefully. Voldemort\nhad said he'd put up wards, so Harry had been confident of not\nbeing observed by Time-Turned Aurors, but still... \"I think this is\na matter you don't need to investigate too hard, Madam Bones.\"",
      "The old witch grinned slightly. \"We can't be seen to go easy on\nthe investigation of so many Noble deaths, Harry Potter. When I\nheard retold your particular account of David's last stand, I made\ncertain to send investigators whom I considered reliable\nin the usual quality of their work. Auror Nobbs and Auror Colon, in\nfact, who are widely respected outside my Department. I found their\nreport to be quite fascinating reading.\" Amelia paused. \"There's a\npossibility that Augustus Rookwood left a ghost -\"",
      "\"Exorcise it before anyone talks to it,\" Harry said, conscious\nof the sudden hammering of his heart.",
      "\"Yes, sir,\" the old witch said dryly. \"I shall disrupt the\nsoul's anchoring a little, and none shall be the wiser when it\nfails to materialize. The second matter is that there was a\nstill-living human arm found among the Dark Lord's things -\"",
      "\"Bellatrix,\" Harry said. His mind had leaped back, made the\nconnection that ongoing trauma had blurred. \"I think that's\nBellatrix Black's arm.\" Lesath Lestrange hadn't been named as\nsomeone who'd lost a parent. \"Oh, bloody hell. She's still out\nthere, isn't she. Can you use her arm to track her down\nsomehow?\"",
      "Amelia Bones had acquired a sour look. \"I see. As I was saying,\na still-living human arm was found among the Dark Lord's things,\nbut it proved to be easily incinerated.\"",
      "\"What idiot -\" Harry stopped himself. \"No, not\nan idiot. Because immediately destroying Dark objects is Department\npolicy. Because of past experiences with rings that really\nshould've been dropped into volcanos immediately. Right?\"",
      "Moody and Amelia nodded in unison. \"Good guess, son,\" said\nMoody.",
      "It might seem literarily inevitable that Harry's past stupidity\nwas going to come back and haunt him in some horrible fashion\nlater, but that was no reason not to try subverting the plot. \"I\nexpect you've thought of this already,\" Harry said, \"but the\nobvious next step is to put out your equivalent of an international\nbulletin for a thin witch missing her left arm. Oh, and add\ntwenty-five thousand Galleons pledged from me - Headmistress, it's\nfine, please trust me on this - to whatever reward is being\noffered.\"",
      "\"Well said.\" The old witch leaned forward slightly. \"The third\nand final matter... there was one truly puzzling element to last\nnight's events, and I am curious to see what you make of it, Harry\nPotter. Found among the corpses was the head and the body of Sirius\nBlack.\"",
      "\"What?\u202f\" yelled Moody, starting half from his chair.\n\"I thought he was in Azkaban!\"",
      "\"So he is,\" said Madam Bones. \"We checked that at once. The\nAzkaban guards reported that Sirius Black was still in his cell.\nBlack's head and body have been transported to the St. Mungo's\nmorgue, and show the same cause of death as the other Death Eaters,\nthat is to say, his head spontaneously fell off. I am also told\nthat Sirius Black is, as of this morning, sitting in the corner of\nhis cell rocking back and forth with his head between his hands. No\nother duplicate Death Eaters have been found. Yet.\"",
      "There was a pause filled with ticking and whooping things, as\npeople considered this.",
      "\"Ah...\" said Minerva. \"That's not possible even by\nYou-Know-Who's standards of possibility. Is it?\"",
      "\"I would have thought so too when I was your age, dear,\" said\nAmelia. \"It is the sixth strangest thing I have ever seen.\"",
      "\"You see, son?\" said Moody. \"This sort of thing is why nobody,\neven me, can ever be paranoid enough.\" The scarred man tilted his\nhead, looking thoughtful, as his bright blue eye kept ever-roving.\n\"Twin brother, concealed from the rest of the world? Walpurga Black\ngave birth to twins, couldn't bear to kill one, knew old Pollux\nwould demand it... nah, ain't buyin' it.\"",
      "\"Any ideas, Mr. Potter?\" said Amelia Bones. \"Or is this another\nmatter into which my Department should not inquire too\nclosely?\"",
      "Harry closed his eyes and thought.",
      "Sirus Black had hunted down Peter Pettigrew, instead of fleeing\nthe country as common sense would have suggested.",
      "Black had been found in the middle of the street, surrounded by\nbodies, laughing.",
      "Nothing left of Pettigrew except one finger.",
      "Pettigrew had been a spy for the Light, not a double agent but\nsomebody who snuck around and found things out.",
      "One of the conspiracy theories about Pettigrew had been that he\nwas an Animagus, since he'd been good at ferreting out secrets even\nin his Hogwarts years.",
      "Dementors sapped all the magic in their vicinity.",
      "Professor Quirrell had said something about a particular type of\nmagic that rearranged flesh like a Muggle smith reshaping metal\nwith hammer and tongs...",
      "Harry opened his eyes again.",
      "\"Was Peter Pettigrew a secret Metamorphmagus?\"",
      "Amelia Bones's face changed. She made a single croaking noise\nand fell backward within her chair.",
      "\"Yes, in fact...\" Minerva said slowly. \"Why?\"",
      "\"Sirius Black Confunded Peter Pettigrew,\" Harry's voice\nexplained patiently, \"to force him to change shape and pretend to\nbe Black. By the time the Confundus wore off, Peter was in Azkaban\nand couldn't change back. The Aurors are used to people in Azkaban\nsaying absolutely anything to get out, so they didn't listen while\nPeter Pettigrew was screaming about it over and over again until\nhis voice wore out.\"",
      "Even Mad-Eye Moody's face showed the horror, then.",
      "\"In retrospect,\" said Harry's voice, which seemed to be\noperating entirely on automatic, \"you should have been suspicious\nwhen you managed to get that one Death Eater hauled off to\nAzkaban without a trial.\"",
      "\"We thought Malfoy was distracted,\" whispered the old witch.\n\"That he was only trying to save himself. There were other Death\nEaters we managed to get then, like Bellatrix -\"",
      "Harry nodded, feeling like his neck and head were moving on\npuppet strings. \"The Dark Lord's most fanatic and devoted servant,\na natural nucleus of opposition for anyone who contested Lucius's\ncontrol of the Death Eaters. You thought Lucius was\ndistracted.\"",
      "\"Get him out of there,\" said Minerva McGonagall. Her voice rose\nto a scream. \"Get him out of there!\u202f\"",
      "Amelia Bones shoved herself up from the chair, whirled on the\nFloo -",
      "\"Stop.\"",
      "Everyone looked at Harry with astonishment, none more than\nMinerva McGonagall.",
      "Something else seemed to have taken over Harry's voice. \"There's\nfour things we still need to discuss. An innocent man has been in\nAzkaban for ten years, eight months, and fourteen days. He can stay\nthere a few minutes longer. That's how urgent those four things\nare.\"",
      "\"You -\" whispered Amelia Bones. \"You should not try to be this\nperson, at your age -\"",
      "\"First. I think I should look at the complete police records on\nevery other Death Eater that went to Azkaban while Lucius was\ndistracted. Can you compile that by tonight?\"",
      "\"Within the hour,\" said Amelia Bones. She looked gray.",
      "Harry nodded. \"Second. Azkaban is over. You'll need to start\npreparations now to move the prisoners to Nurmengard or other\nsecure non-Dementor prisons, and to provide treatment for their\nDementor exposure.\"",
      "\"I,\" said Amelia. The old witch seemed bent, diminished. \"I...\ndo not think, that even with this... scandal, that the remainder of\nthe Wizengamot will bend... and the Dementors must be fed, not so\nmuch as we have fed them, but they must be given some victims, or\nthey will roam the world, prey on innocents...\"",
      "\"It doesn't matter what the Wizengamot says,\" Harry said.\n\"Because -\" Harry's voice choked. \"Because -\" Harry took a deep\nbreath, steadied himself. He thought he could see the shape now of\nthe immediate future, could see it stretching out before him like a\ngolden pathway lit with sunlight. Was this also written, in the\nbook of Time that I must not see? \"Because if I'm right about\nwhat comes next, then sometime very soon, Hermione Granger, the\nGirl-Who-Revived, is going to go to Azkaban and destroy all the\nDementors there.\"",
      "\"Impossible!\" spat Mad-Eye Moody.",
      "\"Merlin,\" whispered Amelia Bones. \"Oh, dear Merlin. That's what\nhappened to the Dementor that Dumbledore 'lost'. That's why they're\nafraid of you - and now her as well?\" Her voice trembled. \"What is\nthis, what is all this?\"",
      "If Hermione believes that Death can be defeated -",
      "Whether or not she could've believed that before, she'll\nbelieve it now.",
      "\"An authorized portkey to Azkaban would be appreciated -\"\nHarry's voice broke again. Tears were streaming down his\ncheeks.",
      "She can't die. I have her horcrux.",
      "But Hermione doesn't need to know about that. Not for one\nmore week.",
      "If she's willing to risk her own life to end this -",
      "\"Though I think, she might make, her own way there...\"",
      "\"Harry?\" said Headmistress McGonagall.",
      "Harry was crying now, huge ragged breaths bursting from him. But\nhe didn't stop talking. Somewhere out there Peter Pettigrew was\nwaiting while Harry cried.",
      "Somewhere out there, everyone was waiting while he cried.",
      "\"Third. Somewhere just inside the wards of Hogwarts. In a highly\ndefensible position. But where emergency cases can be portkeyed in\nfrom just outside the wards. There's going to be a high-security\nh-h-hospital. With very powerful guards, that have taken\nUnbreakable Vows, I don't, I don't care how much gold it takes to\npay for the Vows, it genuinely does not matter any more. And, and\nAlastor Moody is going to design the security architecture, and go\ncompletely overboard on paranoia without being constrained by a\nbudget or sanity or common sense, only it has to open\nsoon.\" Couldn't stop talking to cry.",
      "\"Harry,\" said the Headmistress, \"both of them think you've gone\nmad, they don't know you well enough to know better. You need to\nslow down and explain.\"",
      "Instead Harry reached into his pouch and signed letters with his\nfingers, and lifted out, his fingers straining, a five-kilo chunk\nof gold larger than his fist, from when he'd been experimenting\nthis morning. It made a heavy thud as it landed on the table.",
      "Moody reached over and tapped it with his wand, and then his\nthroat made an incomprehensible sound.",
      "\"That's your starting budget, Alastor, if you need money right\naway. Nicholas Flamel didn't make the Philosopher's Stone, he stole\nit, Dumbledore didn't know the secret history but Monroe did. Once\nyou know how it works, the Stone can do one complete restoration to\nfull health and youth every two hundred and thirty-four seconds.\nThree hundred sixty people per day. One hundred and thirty-four\nthousand healings per year. That should be enough to stop, all the\nwizards everywhere, and all the goblins and house-elves and\nwhoever, from dying. Of old age, or anything else.\" Harry was\nwiping away tears, over and over. \"Flamel had more blood on his\nhands than a hundred Voldemorts, for all the people he could've\nsaved and didn't. The whole time, Moody, the Philosopher's Stone\ncould've healed all your scars and given you back your leg, any\ntime Flamel felt like it. Dumbledore didn't know. I'm sure he\ndidn't know.\" Harry smiled shakily. \"I can't imagine you as a\nteenage witch, Madam Bones, but I bet it looks good on you. That'll\ngive you more energy for trying to keep the Wizengamot from messing\nwith me, because if they get the idea that the Stone is something\nthey can mess with in any way, tax, regulate, I don't care,\nHogwarts is going to secede from Britain and become its own\ncountry. Headmistress, Hogwarts is no longer dependent on the\nMinistry for gold, or for that matter food. You may reform the\neducational curriculum at will. I'm thinking we may want to add\nsome more advanced courses soon, especially in Muggle studies.\"",
      "\"Slow down!\u202f\" said Minerva McGonagall.",
      "\"Fourth -\" Harry said, and then stopped.",
      "Fourth. Begin preparations for an orderly take-down of the\nStatute of Secrecy and to provide magical healing on a mass scale\nto the Muggle world. Those who oppose this agenda in any way may be\ndenied services by the Stone...",
      "Harry's lips couldn't move. Not wouldn't, couldn't.",
      "With six billion Muggles thinking creatively about how to use\nmagic...",
      "Transfiguring antimatter was just one idea. It wasn't even the\nmost destructive idea. There were also black holes and negatively\ncharged strangelets. And if black holes couldn't be Transfigured\nbecause they didn't already exist as magic defined that to\nwithin some spatial radius, there was just Transfiguring lots and\nlots of nuclear weapons and Black Death plague that could reproduce\nbefore the Transfiguration wore off and Harry hadn't even thought\nabout the problem for five minutes but it didn't matter because\nhe'd already thought of enough. Someone would think of it, someone\nwould talk, someone would try it. The probability was as close to\ncertainty as made no difference.",
      "What happened if you Transfigured a cubic millimeter of up\nquarks, just the up quarks without any down quarks to bind them?\nHarry didn't even know, and up quarks were certainly a kind of\nsubstance that already existed. All it might take was one single\nMuggleborn who knew the names of the six quarks deciding to try it.\nThat could be the clock ticking down to the prophesied end\nof the world.",
      "Harry would have tried to deny the thought, rationalize it\naway.",
      "He couldn't do that either.",
      "It wasn't a thing-Harry-Potter-would-do.",
      "Like water flowing downhill, Harry Potter would take no chances\nwhen it came to not destroying the world.",
      "\"Fourth?\" said Amelia Bones, who was looking like she'd been hit\nrepeatedly in the face with a planet. \"What comes\nfourth?\u202f\"",
      "\"Never mind,\" said Harry. His voice did not break. He did not\nfold over sobbing. There were still lives he could save and those\ntook precedence. \"Never mind. Chief Warlock Bones, I've given the\nregency of the Wizengamot into your hands. Please use that position\nto announce internationally that the Stone's healing power will\nsoon be made available to all, and that meanwhile, all dying\npatients are to be kept alive at any cost, no matter what magic is\nrequired to do it. That announcement is your absolute priority.\nWhen you have done that you may rescue Peter Pettigrew and tell\nyour old Department to begin preparations for shutting down\nAzkaban. Then please have someone prepare a full list of imprisoned\nDeath Eaters and what was said at their trials and whether Lucius\nseemed strangely uninterested in defending them. Thank you. That's\nall.\"",
      "Amelia Bones turned without another word, and dashed into the\nFloo like it was her own self that was on fire.",
      "\"And someone,\" Harry said, his voice breaking again now that it\nwas all set in motion, and crying wasn't costing time, though the\nvast majority of total lives at stake had turned out not to be\nsavable just yet, \"someone has to, someone tell Remus Lupin.\"",

      "A/N: Farewell, Terry Pratchett, 1948-2015. Your characters\nwere an inspiration to me, and now I can see how much they taught\nme about Level 1 and Level 3 Character Intelligence: that\nself-awareness often manifests as humor or as genre-savviness; that\nan inner spark of optimization can shine just as brightly through\ncharacters who are told (but not shown) to be lowly and stupid;\nthat intelligent characters can go along with a spark of goodness\nand light running through a story, rather than cynicism. I wish I\ncould have met you, and spoken with you about your methods. You\nwere loved by so many, and surely at least one person who would\ntear apart the foundations of reality to bring you back; but your\nbrain is dead and warm now, and so your story ends.",
      "Even if the stars should die in heaven,\nOur sins can never be undone.\nNo single death will be forgiven\nWhen fades at last the last lit sun.\nThen in the cold and silent black\nAs light and matter end,\nWe'll have ourselves a last look back\nAnd toast an absent friend.",
      "The boy sat in an office near to where the once-Deputy\nHeadmistress had held court. His tears had run dry hours ago. Now\nthere was only the waiting to see what would become of him, the\norphan ward of Hogwarts, whose life and happiness lay in the hands\nof his family's enemies. The boy had been called to this room, and\nhe had come because there was nothing else to do and nowhere else\nto go. Vincent and Gregory had left his side, called back by their\nmothers for their fathers' hurried funerals. Perhaps the boy should\nhave gone with them, but he could not bring himself to do so. He\nwould not have been able to act the part of a Malfoy. The feeling\nof emptiness that filled him up was so profound that it left no\nroom even for pretended courtesy.",
      "Everyone was dead.",
      "His father was dead, and his godfather Mr. MacNair, and his\nfallback godfather Mr. Avery. Even Sirius Black, his mother's\ncousin, had somehow managed to die, and the last remnant of House\nBlack was no friend to any Malfoy.",
      "Everyone was dead.",
      "There came a knock upon the office's door; and then, when the\nboy made no reply, the door opened, revealing -",
      "\"Go away,\" Draco Malfoy said to the Boy-Who-Lived. He couldn't\nmuster any force in the words.",
      "\"I will soon,\" Harry Potter said, as he stepped into the room.\n\"But there's a decision to be made, and only you can make it.\"",
      "Draco turned his head toward the wall, because just looking at\nHarry Potter took more energy than he had left in him.",
      "\"You have to decide,\" Harry said, \"what happens to Draco Malfoy\nafter this. I don't mean that in any ominous way. No matter what,\nyou're still going to grow up to be the rich heir of a Noble and\nMost Ancient House. The thing is,\" Harry's voice was wavering now,\n\"the thing is, there's a horrible truth you don't know, and I keep\nthinking that if you knew, you'd tell me not to be your friend\nanymore. And I don't want to stop being your friend. But to just -\nnever tell you - and always maintain that lie so I can go on being\nyour friend - I can't do that. It's also wrong. I don't... don't\nwant this anymore, I don't want to be manipulating you.\nI've hurt you too much already.\"",
      "Then stop trying to be my friend, you're no good at it\nanyway. The words rose up into Draco's consciousness, and were\nrejected from his lips. He felt like he'd mostly lost Harry\nalready, from the games Harry had played with their friendship, the\nlies and manipulations; and yet the thought of going back to\nSlytherin alone, maybe without Vincent and Gregory if their mothers\nterminated the arrangement... Draco didn't want to do that, he\ndidn't want to go back to Slytherin and live out his life among\nonly people who'd agreed to be Sorted into Slytherin House. Draco\nwas barely sensible enough to remember how many of his real friends\nwere also friends with Harry, that Padma was a Ravenclaw and even\nTheodore was a Chaotic Lieutenant. All that remained of Malfoy\nHouse was a tradition, now; and that tradition said it wasn't\nclever to tell the war's victor to go away and stop trying to be\nfriends with you.",
      "\"All right,\" Draco said emptily. \"Tell me.\"",
      "\"That's what I'm going to do,\" Harry said. \"And then the\nHeadmistress will come in after I leave, and seal away your last\nhalf-hour of memory. But before then, knowing the whole truth,\nyou'll get to decide whether you still want to be involved with\nme.\" Harry's voice was shaking. \"Um. According to the records I was\nreading through before I came here, the story really began in 1926\nwith the birth of a half-blood wizard named Tom Morfin Riddle. His\nmother died in childbirth, and he grew up in a Muggle orphanage,\nuntil his Hogwarts letter was brought to him by Professor\nDumbledore...\"",
      "The Boy-Who-Lived continued speaking, words that slammed into\nwhat was left of Draco's mind like falling houses.",
      "The Dark Lord had been a half-blood. He'd never believed in\nblood purity for a fraction of a second.",
      "Tom Riddle had come up with the idea of Lord Voldemort as a\nbad joke.",
      "The Death Eaters had been meant to lose to David Monroe, so\nMonroe could take over.",
      "After giving up on that, Tom Riddle had gone on playing\nVoldemort instead of actually trying to win, because he'd liked\nbossing the Death Eaters around.",
      "Voldemort used me to try to frame Father for my attempted\nmurder, then used me again to go after the Philosopher's\nStone. Draco couldn't remember that part, but he'd already\nbeen told that he'd been used as a pawn alongside Professor Sprout,\nand that no charges would be filed.",
      "And then the last horror.",
      "\"You -\" whispered Draco Malfoy. \"You -\"",
      "\"I'm the one who killed your father and all the other Death\nEaters last night. They'd been told to open fire on me the moment I\ndid anything, so I had to kill them in order to have a chance at\ndealing with Voldemort, who was a danger to the entire world.\"\nHarry Potter's voice was strained. \"I didn't think about you and\nTheodore and Vincent and Gregory, but if I had, I'd have done it\nanyway. My mind managed not to realise until afterwards that Mr.\nWhite was Lucius, but if I'd realised, I still wouldn't have risked\nleaving him alive, in case he knew wandless magic. The thought\noccurred to me long before that it would be pretty convenient, in\nterms of the political landscape, for all the Death Eaters to\nsuddenly die. I always thought that the Death Eaters were horrible\npeople, much more strongly than I ever let on to you, since the\nfirst day we met. But if your father hadn't been there, and I'd had\na button that could kill him remotely, I wouldn't have pressed the\nbutton just for political reasons. The way I feel about what I've\ndone, and whether there's remorse... well, there's a part of me\nthat's screaming in generic horror about having killed anyone. And\nanother part that says that from a moral standpoint, the Death\nEaters signed away their lives on the day they signed up with\nVoldemort. They pointed their wands at me first, blah blah and so\non. But right now I just feel sick about what I've done to you.\nAgain. I feel like,\" Harry Potter's voice wobbled a bit,\n\"everything I do only hurts you, for all my good\nintentions, that you've only ever lost things from being\naround me, so if you tell me to stay away entirely from Draco\nMalfoy after this, then I will. And if you want me to try to be\nyour friend for real this time, without ever trying to manipulate\nyou again, without ever using you again or risking hurting you\nagain, then I will, I swear I will.\"",
      "The next Lord Malfoy was crying, openly in front of his enemy,\ndecorum and composure abandoned, because he didn't have anyone left\nfor whose sake he could keep it.",
      "A lie.",
      "A lie.",
      "Everything had been a lie, it was all lies piled on top of lies,\nlies lies lies -",
      "\"You should die,\" Draco forced out. \"You should die for\nhaving killed Father.\" The words only filled him with more\nemptiness, but they had to be said.",
      "Harry Potter just shook his head. \"And if that's not an\noption?\"",
      "\"You should hurt.\"",
      "Harry only shook his head again.",
      "The Boy-Who-Lived pressed the Lord Malfoy for his decision.",
      "The Lord Malfoy refused to give it. He couldn't say it, couldn't\nbring himself to say it, either way. He didn't want the war's\nvictor and their mutual friends to abandon him, and he wasn't going\nto give Harry the absolution he wanted, either.",
      "So Draco Malfoy refused to answer, and then the time of that\nself's memory ended.",
      "The boy sat in an office near to where the once-Deputy\nHeadmistress had held court. His tears had run dry hours ago.

      "Everyone was dead, and it had all been futile from the\nbeginning.",
      "There was a knock upon the office door, and then, after a polite\npause, it opened to reveal Headmistress McGonagall, dressed much as\nshe had dressed when she was a Professor. \"Mr. Malfoy?\" his\nfamily's victorious enemy said. \"Please come with me.\"",
      "Listlessly, Draco rose up, and followed her out of the office.\nSeeing Harry Potter waiting beside her gave him some pause, but\nthen his mind simply shut it out.",
      "\"Here's the last thing,\" Harry Potter said. \"I found it in a\nfolded parchment whose outside said that it was the last weapon to\nbe used against House Malfoy, telling me not to read any further\nuntil the whole war hung in the balance. I didn't want to tell it\nto you before because I thought it might prejudice your decision\nunfairly. If you were a good person who never killed or lied, but\nyou had to do one or the other, which would be worse?\"",
      "Draco ignored him and continued in Headmistress McGonagall's\ncompany, leaving Harry behind looking sadly after.",
      "They came to the Headmistress's old office, where she lit her\nFloo-fire with a wave of her wand, said to the green flame\n\"Gringotts travel office\" and stepped through after a firm glance\nin his direction.",
      "For lack of any other option, Draco Malfoy followed.",
      "She lay in bed, feeling more listless than usual that morning,\nawoken too early with the Sun just beginning to rise - though the\ndirect sunlight was blocked by the skyscrapers that shadowed her\nhouse. A faint tinge of hangover gnawed at her temples, dried her\nmouth; she tried to be sparing with the drink (though she didn't\nknow why she bothered) but yesterday she'd felt... even more\ndepressed than usual, like she'd lost something, somehow. Not for\nthe first time, not for the hundredth time, she thought about\nmoving - to Adelaide, to Perth, maybe to Perth Amboy if that was\nwhat it took. She always had the sense there was somewhere else she\nought to be; but while she could live a comfortable life on the\npayments the insurance company made to her, she couldn't afford\nluxuries. She couldn't pay to go gallivanting around the world\nlooking for someplace that fit her unsatisfied sense of belonging.\nShe'd watched the TV for long enough, she'd rented enough\ntravelogues, to know that nowhere the VCR showed her gave her any\nmore sense of rightness than Sydney.",
      "She'd felt frozen, stopped in time, ever since the traffic\naccident that had stolen her memories - not just of a dead family\nthat meant nothing to her now, but memories like how a stove\nworked. She suspected, no, she knew, that whatever her\nheart was waiting for, whatever key needed to turn inside her to\nmake her life begin moving again, it was one more thing she'd lost\nto that runaway minivan. She thought about that almost every\nmorning, trying to guess what she was missing, missing, missing\nfrom her life and mind.",
      "Somebody rang her doorbell.",
      "She groaned, turning her head far enough to look at the LED\nalarm clock at the side of her bed. 6:31, it said, with the AM dot\nlit. Seriously? Well, that idiot could wait while she\nstaggered out of bed at her own pace, then.",
      "Stagger out of bed she did, ignoring the doorbell as it rang\nagain, as she ducked into the bathroom and dressed herself.",
      "She clambered down the stairs, ignoring the ever-nagging sense\nthat someone else ought to be answering her door for her. \"Who's\nthere?\" she called to the closed door; the door had a peephole, but\nit was fogged over.",
      "\"Are you Nancy Manson?\" came a woman's voice, speaking in a\nprecise Scottish accent.",
      "\"Yes,\" she said cautiously.",
      "\"Eunoe,\" spoke the Scottish voice, and Nancy leapt back\nin shock as a flash of light came from the door and hit\nher and...",
      "Nancy swayed, putting a hand to her forehead. Flashes of light\njust going through doors and hitting people, that was... that\nwas... that wasn't particularly surprising...",
      "\"Would you please open the door?\" said the Scottish woman's\nvoice. \"The war is over and your memories should be returning\nshortly. There's someone here who ought to see you.\"",
      "My memories -",
      "Nancy's head was already feeling clogged, like she was about to\nstart hacking something out of her brain, but she managed to reach\nout and yank the door open.",
      "There in front of her was a woman dressed as a (perfectly\nnormal) witch, from black robes to tall pointed hat -",
      "- and standing beside her a boy, with short white-blonde hair\nand wearing (perfectly normal) dark robes trimmed in\ngreen, staring at her with his jaw dropped and eyes wide and\nbeginning to fill with tears.",
      "Green-trimmed robes and white-blonde hair...",
      "Something warm stirred in her memory. She felt her heart rising\ninto her throat as she realized that the thing that she'd been\nlooking for these past ten years might be right in front of her\nthis very instant. Somewhere deep inside her, ice was cracking\naround her heart, the piece of her that had been stopped for so\nlong preparing to move once more.",
      "The boy was staring at her, his mouth working soundlessly.",
      "A mysterious name came into her mind, rose to her lips.",

There was so much to\ndo, so many things, that even Headmistress McGonagall didn't seem\nto know where to start, and certainly not Harry.

Was\nthere any next first thing that needed to happen...",

Over his\nleft shoulder was slung a knapsack, of sturdy gray leather set with\nsilver filigree that held four green pearl-like stones. It looked\nlike a thoroughly enchanted knapsack, one that could contain the\ncontents of a Muggle house.",

      "\"I know,\" Harry said, through the thickness of his throat. \"You\ndon't have to say it.\"",
      "\"Lily was a fine upstanding witch, Mr. Potter. I would not have\nyou think otherwise from any words I said to you.\"",
      "\"Severus?\u202f\" said Minerva McGonagall, looking as shocked\nas if she'd been bitten by her own shoes.",
      "The former Potions Master kept his eyes on Harry. \"More than one\nbar lay between myself and Lily, most notably my ill-advised\nattempts to curry favor with the purebloods of my house. If I made\nit sound like one mistake upon a muddy field ended it all, if I\npretended that she had no reason but shallowness not to love me, I\nhope your books have also told you why fools may say such\nthings.\"",
      "\"They did,\" Harry said. He was looking at the fine gray knapsack\non Severus Snape's left shoulder, unable to meet the Potions\nMaster's eyes. \"They did.\"",
      "\"However,\" the former Potions Master continued, \"I'm afraid I\nhave nothing more to say about your father than what I've already\ntold you.\"",
      "\"Severus!\"",
      "The former Potions Master seemed to have eyes only for Harry.\n\"The Dark Mark upon my arm is not dead, nor is the prophecy\nfulfilled by that story you recounted before the crowd. How did you\ndestroy all but a remnant of the Dark Lord?\"",
      "Harry hesitated. \"I Obliviated most of his memories and...\nsealed him, I guess is how wizards say it. Even if the seal breaks,\nhe won't come back as himself.\"",
      "Severus frowned briefly and then shrugged. \"I suppose that is\nacceptable.\"",
      "\"Professor Snape,\" Harry said, because this too was now his\nresponsibility, \"the Order of the Phoenix owes you for services\nrendered. I'm in an excellent position to repay it, both\nfinancially and magically. Just in case you want to start your next\nlife in a position of wealth, or with better hair, or\nsomething.\"",
      "\"Strange words to say to such as me,\" the former Potions Master\nsaid in a soft drawl. \"I went to the Dark Lord intending to sell\nhim the prophecy in exchange for Lily's love becoming mine, by\nwhatever darkness was required to achieve it. That is hardly\nsomething to be forgiven lightly. And then, in the years after when\nI was a Potions Master... that you experienced yourself. Do you\nthink my service to the Order of the Phoenix has repaid all my\nsins?\"",
      "\"People are always broken,\" Harry said, though the words stuck\nin his throat. \"They always make mistakes. At least you tried to\nrepay them.\"",
      "\"Perhaps,\" said the former Potions Master. \"My final duty was to\nfail in guarding the Stone, to be struck down. This I have done,\nand I survived it, which I never expected to do.\" Severus was\nleaning against the door through which he'd entered, taking his\nweight off his left leg. \"I would not have thought to ask for your\nforgiveness, but since you offer it so freely, I will accept with\nthanks. From this day on I wish to take less unkindly ways, and I\nthink that is best done by starting over.\"",
      "Tears glistened on Minerva McGonagall's nose and cheeks, when\nshe spoke her voice was without hope. \"Surely you could start over\ninside Hogwarts.\"",
      "Severus shook his head. \"Too many students would remember me as\nthe evil Potions Master. No, Minerva. I will go someplace new, and\ntake a new name, and find someone new to love.\"",
      "\"Severus Snape,\" Harry said, because it was his responsibility\nto say it, \"has all your will been done?\"",
      "\"Lily's killer is vanquished,\" the man said. \"I am content.\"",
      "The Headmistress lowered her head. \"Be well, Severus,\" she\nwhispered.",
      "\"I do have one last piece of advice,\" Harry said. \"If you want\nit.\"",
      "\"What is it?\" said Severus Snape.",
      "\"Ruminating about the past can contribute to depression. You\nhave my blanket permisson to just never think about your past,\never. You shouldn't think that it's your responsibility to Lily to\nbear your guilt for her, or anything like that. Just keep your mind\non your future and whatever new people you meet.\"",
      "\"I shall take your wisdom into consideration,\" Severus said\nneutrally.",
      "\"Also, try a different brand of hair shampoo.\"",
      "A wry grin crossed Severus's face, and Harry thought it might\nhave been, for the first time, that man's true smile. \"Drop dead,\nPotter.\"",
      "Harry laughed.",
      "Severus laughed.",
      "Minerva was sobbing.",
      "Without saying anything else, the free man took a pinch of Floo\npowder, and cast it into the office's fireplace, and strode into\nthe green flame whispering something that nobody caught; and that\nwas the last that anyone ever heard of Severus Snape.",

      "And it was evening and it was morning, the last day. June 15th,\n1992.",
      "The beginning light of morning, the pre-dawn before sunrise, was\nbarely brightening the sky. To the east of Hogwarts, where the Sun\nwould rise, that faintest tinge of grey made barely visible the\nhilly horizon beyond the Quidditch stands.",
      "The stone terrace-platform where Harry now sat would be high\nenough to see the dawn beyond the hills below; he'd asked for that,\nwhen he was describing his new office.",
      "Harry was currently sitting cross-legged on a cushion, chilly\npre-morning breezes stirring over his exposed hands and face. He'd\nordered the house-elves to bring up the hand-glittered throne from\nhis previous office as General Chaos... and then he'd told the\nelves to put it back, once it had occurred to Harry to start\nworrying about where his taste in decorations had come from and\nwhether Voldemort had once possessed a similar throne. Which,\nitself, wasn't a knockdown argument - it wasn't like sitting on a\nglittery throne to survey the lands below Hogwarts was\nunethical in any way Harry's moral philosophy could make\nout - but Harry had decided that he needed to take time and think\nit through. Meanwhile, simple cushions would do well enough.",
      "In the room below, connected to the rooftop by a simple wooden\nladder, was Harry's new office inside Hogwarts. A wide room,\nsurrounded by full-wall windows on four sides for sunlight;\ncurrently bare of furnishings but for four chairs and a desk. Harry\nhad told Headmistress McGonagall what he was looking for, and\nHeadmistress McGonagall had put on the Sorting Hat and then told\nHarry the series of twists and turns that would take him where he\nwanted to be. High enough in Hogwarts that the castle shouldn't\nhave been that tall, high enough in Hogwarts that nobody looking\nfrom the outside would see a piece of castle corresponding to where\nHarry now sat. It seemed like an elementary precaution against\nsnipers that there was no reason not to take.",
      "Though, on the flip side, Harry had no idea where he currently\nwas in any real sense. If his office couldn't be seen from\nthe lands below, then how was Harry seeing the lands, how were\nphotons making it from the landscape to him? On the western side of\nthe horizon, stars still glittered, clear in the pre-dawn air. Were\nthose photons the actual photons that had been emitted by huge\nplasma furnaces in the unimaginable distance? Or did Harry now sit\nwithin some dreaming vision of the Hogwarts castle? Or was it all,\nwithout any further explanation, 'just magic'? He needed to get\nelectricity to work better around magic so he could experiment with\nshining lasers downward and upward.",
      "And yes, Harry had his own office on Hogwarts now. He didn't\nhave any official title yet, but the Boy-Who-Lived was now a true\nfixture of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the\nsoon-to-be-home of the Philosopher's Stone and the world's only\nwizarding institution of genuinely higher education. It wasn't\nfully secured, but Professor Vector had put up some preliminary\nCharms and Runes to screen the office and its rooftop against\neavesdropping.",
      "Harry sat on his cushion, near the edge of his office's roof,\nand gazed down upon trees and lakes and flowering grass. Far below,\ncarriages sat motionlessly, not yet harnessed to skeletal horses.\nSmall boats littered the shore, prepared to ferry younger students\nacross the lake when the time came. The Hogwarts Express had\narrived overnight, and now the train cars and the huge\nold-fashioned engine awaited on the other side of the southern\nlake. All was ready to take the students home after the\nLeave-Taking Feast in the morning.",
      "Harry stared across the lake, at the great old-fashioned\nlocomotive he wouldn't be riding home this time. Again. There was a\nstrange sadness and worry to that thought, like Harry was already\nstarting to miss out on the bonding experiences with the other\nstudents his age - if you could say that at all, when a\nsignificant part of Harry had been born in 1926. It had felt to\nHarry, last night in the Ravenclaw common room, like the gap\nbetween him and the other students had, yes, widened even further.\nThough that might only have been from the questions Padma Patil and\nAnthony Goldstein had excitedly asked each other about the\nGirl-Who-Revived, the rapid-fire speculations shooting through the\nair from Ravenclaw to Ravenclaw. Harry had known the answers, he'd\nknown all the answers, and he hadn't been able to say them.",
      "There was a part of Harry that was tempted to go on the Hogwarts\nExpress and then come back to Hogwarts by Floo. But when Harry\nimagined finding five other students for his compartment, and then\nspending the next eight hours keeping secrets from Neville or Padma\nor Dean or Tracey or Lavender... it didn't seem like an attractive\nprospect. Harry felt like he ought to do it for reasons of\nSocializing with the Other Children, but he did not want\nto do it. He could meet with everyone again at the start of the\nnext school year, when there would be other topics of which he\ncould speak more freely.",
      "Harry stared south across the lake, at the huge old locomotive,\nand thought about the rest of his life.",
      "About the Future.",
      "The prophecy Dumbledore's letter had mentioned about him tearing\napart the stars in heaven... well, that sounded\noptimistic. That part had an obvious interpretation to anyone who'd\ngrown up with the right sort of upbringing. It described a future\nwhere humanity had won, more or less. It wasn't what Harry usually\nthought about when he gazed at the stars, but from a truly\nadult perspective, the stars were enormous heaps of\nvaluable raw materials that had unfortunately caught fire and\nneeded to be scattered and put out. If you were tapping the huge\nhydrogen-helium reservoirs for raw materials, that meant your\nspecies had successfully grown up.",
      "Unless the prophecy had been referring to something else\nentirely. Dumbledore might have been misinterpreting some seer's\nwords... but his message to Harry had been phrased as if there'd\nbeen a prophecy about Harry personally tearing apart\nstars, in the foreseeable future. Which seemed potentially more\nworrisome, though by no means certain to be true, or a bad thing if\nit was true...",
      "Harry vented a sigh. He'd begun to understand, in the long hours\nbefore sleep had taken him last night, just what Dumbledore's last\nmessage implied.",
      "Looking back on the events of the 1991-1992 Hogwarts school year\nwas nothing short of bone-freezingly terrifying, now that Harry\nunderstood what he was seeing.",
      "It wasn't just that Harry had kept the frequent company of his\ngood friend Lord Voldemort. It wasn't even mostly\nthat.",
      "It was the vision of a narrow line of Time that Albus Dumbledore\nhad steered through fate's narrow keyhole, a hair-thin strand of\npossibility threaded through a needle's eye.",
      "The prophecies had instructed Dumbledore to have Tom Riddle's\nintelligence copied onto the brain of a wizarding infant who would\nthen grow up learning Muggle science. What did it say about the\nlikely shape of the Future, if that was the first or best\nstrategy the seers could find that didn't lead to\ncatastrophe?",
      "Harry could look back now on the Unbreakable Vow that he'd made,\nand guess that if not for that Vow, disaster might have already\nbeen set in motion yesterday when Harry had wanted to tear down the\nInternational Statute of Secrecy. Which in turn strongly suggested\nthat the many prophecies Dumbledore had read and whose instructions\nhe'd followed, had somehow ensured that Harry and Voldemort would\ncollide in exactly the right way to cause Voldemort to\nforce Harry to make that Unbreakable Vow. That the Unbreakable Vow\nhad been part of Time's narrow keyhole, one of the improbable\npreconditions for allowing the Earth's peoples to survive.",
      "A Vow whose sole purpose was to protect everyone from Harry's\ncurrent stupidity.",
      "It was like watching a videotape of an almost-traffic-accident\nthat had happened to you, where you remembered another car missing\nyou by centimeters, and the video showing that somebody had\nalso thrown a pebble in exactly the right way to cause an\nenormous lorry to miss that near-collision, and if they hadn't\nthrown that pebble then you and all your family in the automobile\nand your entire planet would have been hit by the lorry,\nwhich, in the metaphor, represented your own sheer\nobliviousness.",
      "Harry had been warned, he'd known on some\nlevel or the Vow wouldn't have stopped him, and yet he'd\nstill almost made the wrong choice and destroyed the\nworld. Harry could look back now and see that, yes, the\nalternate-Harry with no Vow would've had trouble accepting the\nreasoning that said you couldn't get magical healing to Muggles as\nfast as possible. If the alternate-Harry had acknowledged the\ndanger at all, he would have rationalized it, tried to figure out\nsome clever way around the problem and refused to accept taking\na few years longer to do it, and so the world would have\nended. Even after all the warnings Harry had received, it\nstill wouldn't have worked without the Unbreakable\nVow.",
      "One tiny strand of Time, being threaded through a needle's\neye.",
      "Harry didn't know how to handle this revelation. It wasn't a\nsort of situation that human beings had evolved emotions to handle.\nAll Harry could do was stare at how close he had come to disaster,\nmight come again to disaster if that Vow was fated to\ntrigger more than once, and think...",
      "Think...",
      "'I don't want that to happen again' didn't seem like the right\nthought. He'd never wanted to destroy the world in the\nfirst place. Harry hadn't lacked for protective feelings about\nEarth's sapient population, those protective feelings had been the\nproblem in a way. What Harry had lacked was some element\nof clear vision, of being willing to consciously acknowledge what\nhe'd already known deep down.",
      "And the whole thing with Harry having spent the last year\ncozying up to the Defense Professor didn't speak highly of his\nintellect either. It seemed to point to the same problem, even.\nThere were things Harry had known or strongly suspected on some\nlevel, but never promoted to conscious attention. And so he had\nfailed and nearly died.",
      "I need to raise the level of my game.",
      "That was the thought Harry was looking for. He had to do better\nthan this, become a less stupid person than this.",
      "I need to raise the level of my game, or fail.",
      "Dumbledore had destroyed the recordings in the Hall of Prophecy\nand arranged for no further recordings to be made. There'd\napparently been a prophecy that said Harry mustn't look upon those\nprophecies. And the obvious next thought, which might or might not\nbe true, was that saving the world was beyond the reach of\nprophetic instruction. That winning would take plans that were\ntoo complex for seers' messages, or that Divination couldn't see\nsomehow. If there'd been some way for Dumbledore to save the world\nhimself, then prophecy would probably have told Dumbledore how to\ndo that. Instead the prophecies had told Dumbledore how to create\nthe preconditions for a particular sort of person existing; a\nperson, maybe, who could unravel a challenge more difficult than\nprophecy could solve directly. That was why Harry had been placed\non his own, to think without prophetic guidance. If all Harry did\nwas follow mysterious orders from prophecies, then he wouldn't\nmature into a person who could perform that unknown task.",
      "And right now, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres was still a\nwalking catastrophe who'd needed to be constrained by an\nUnbreakable Vow to prevent him from immediately setting\nthe Earth on an inevitable course toward destruction when he'd\nalready been warned against it. That had happened\nliterally yesterday, just one day after he'd helped\nVoldemort almost take over the planet.",
      "A certain line from Tolkien kept running through Harry's mind,\nthe part where Frodo upon Mount Doom put on the ring, and Sauron\nsuddenly realized what a complete idiot he'd been. 'And\nthe magnitude of his own folly was at last laid bare', or however\nthat had gone.",
      "There was a huge gap between who Harry needed to become, and who\nhe was right now.",
      "And Harry didn't think that time, life experience, and puberty\nwould take care of that automatically, though they might help.\nThough if Harry could grow into an adult that was to this\nself what a normal adult was to a normal eleven-year-old, maybe\nthat would be enough to steer through Time's narrow\nkeyhole...",
      "He had to grow up, somehow, and there was no traditional path\nlaid out before him for accomplishing that.",
      "The thought came then to Harry of another work of fiction, more\nobscure than Tolkien:",
      "You can only arrive at mastery by practicing the techniques\nyou have learned, facing challenges and apprehending them, using to\nthe fullest the tools you have been taught, until they shatter in\nyour hands and you are left in the midst of wreckage absolute... I\ncannot create masters. I have never known how to create masters.\nGo, then, and fail... You have been shaped into something that may\nemerge from the wreckage, determined to remake your Art. I cannot\ncreate masters, but if you had not been taught, your chances would\nbe less. The higher road begins after the Art seems to fail you;\nthough the reality will be that it was you who failed your\nArt.",
      "It wasn't that Harry had gone down the wrong path, it\nwasn't that the road to sanity lay somewhere outside of science.\nBut reading science papers hadn't been enough. All the\ncognitive psychology papers about known bugs in the human brain and\nso on had helped, but they hadn't been\nsufficient. He'd failed to reach what Harry was starting\nto realise was a shockingly high standard of being so\nincredibly, unbelievably rational that you actually started to\nget things right, as opposed to having a handy language in\nwhich to describe afterwards everything you'd just done wrong.\nHarry could look back now and apply ideas like 'motivated\ncognition' to see where he'd gone astray over the last year. That\ncounted for something, when it came to being saner in the future.\nThat was better than having no idea what he'd done wrong. But that\nwasn't yet being the person who could pass through Time's narrow\nkeyhole, the adult form whose possibility Dumbledore had\nbeen instructed by seers to create.",
      "I need to think faster, grow up faster... How alone am I,\nhow alone will I be? Am I making the same mistake I made during\nProfessor Quirrell's first battle, when I didn't realise Hermione\nhad captains? The mistake I made when I didn't tell Dumbledore\nabout the sense of doom, once I realised Dumbledore probably wasn't\nmad or evil?",
      "It would help if Muggles had classes for this sort of thing, but\nthey didn't. Maybe Harry could recruit Daniel Kahneman, fake his\ndeath, rejuvenate him with the Stone, and put him in charge of\ninventing better training methods...",
      "Harry took the Elder Wand out of his robes, gazed again at the\ndark-grey wood that Dumbledore had passed down to him. Harry had\ntried to think faster this time, he'd tried to complete\nthe pattern implied by the Cloak of Invisibility and the\nResurrection Stone. The Cloak of Invisibility had possessed the\nlegendary power of hiding the wearer, and the hidden power of\nallowing the wearer to hide from Death itself in the form of\nDementors. The Resurrection Stone had the legendary power of\nsummoning an image of the dead, and then Voldemort had incorporated\nit into his horcrux system to allow his spirit to move freely. The\nsecond Deathly Hallow was a potential component of a system of true\nimmortality that Cadmus Peverell had never completed, maybe due to\nhis having ethics.",
      "And then there was the third Deathly Hallow, the Elder Wand of\nAntioch Peverell, that legend said passed from wizard to stronger\nwizard, and made its holder invincible against ordinary attacks;\nthat was the known and overt characteristic...",
      "The Elder Wand that had belonged to Dumbledore, who'd been\ntrying to prevent the Death of the world itself.",
      "The purpose of the Elder Wand always going to the victor might\nbe to find the strongest living wizard and empower them still\nfurther, in case there was any threat to their entire species; it\ncould secretly be a tool to defeat Death in its form as the\ndestroyer of worlds.",
      "But if there was some higher power locked within the Elder Wand,\nit had not presented itself to Harry based on that guess. Harry had\nraised up the Elder Wand and spoken to it, named himself a\ndescendant of Peverell who accepted his family's quest; he'd\npromised the Elder Wand that he would do his best to save the world\nfrom Death, and take up Dumbledore's duty. And the Elder Wand had\nanswered no more strongly to his hand than before, refusing his\nattempt to jump ahead in the story. Maybe Harry needed to strike\nhis first true blow against the Death of worlds before the Elder\nWand would acknowledge him; as the heir of Ignotus Peverell had\nalready defeated Death's shadow, and the heir of Cadmus Peverell\nhad already survived the Death of his body, when their respective\nDeathly Hallows had revealed their secrets.",
      "At least Harry had managed to guess that, contrary to legend,\nthe Elder Wand didn't contain a core of 'Thestral hair'. Harry had\nseen Thestrals, and they were skeletal horses with smooth skin and\nno visible mane on their skull-like heads, nor tufts on their bony\ntails. But what core was truly inside the Elder Wand, Harry hadn't\nyet felt himself knowing; nor had he been able to find, anywhere on\nthe Elder Wand, the circle-triangle-line of the Deathly Hallows\nthat should have been present.",
      "\"I don't suppose,\" Harry murmured to the Elder Wand, \"you could\njust tell me?\"",
      "There came back no answer from the globe-knobbed wand; only a\nsense of glory and contained power, watching him skeptically.",
      "Harry sighed, and put the most powerful wand in the world back\ninto his school robes. He'd get it eventually, and hopefully in\ntime.",
      "Maybe faster, if there was someone to help him do the\nresearch.",
      "Harry was aware on some level - no, he needed to stop being\naware of things on some level and start just being aware\nof them - Harry was explicitly and consciously aware that he was\nruminating about the Future mostly to distract himself from the\nimminent arrival of Hermione Granger. Who would receive a clear\nbill of health from St. Mungo's, when she woke up very early this\nmorning, and who would then Floo with Professor Flitwick back to\nHogwarts. Whereupon she'd tell Professor Flitwick that she needed\nto speak with Harry Potter immediately. There'd been a note from\nHarry to himself about that, when Harry had woken up later this\nmorning with the sun already risen in the Ravenclaw dorm. He'd read\nthe note, and then Time-Turned back to before the dawn hour when\nHermione Granger would arrive.",
      "She won't actually be angry with me.",
      "...",
      "Seriously. Hermione isn't that kind of person. Maybe she was\nat the start of the year but she's too self-aware to fall for that\none now.",
      "...",
      "What do you mean, '...'? If you have something to say, inner\nvoice, just say it! We're trying to be more aware of our own\nthought processes, remember?",
      "The sky had gone full blue-gray, dawn barely short of sunrise,\nby the time that Harry heard the sound of footsteps coming from the\nladder that opened into his new office. Hastily Harry stood up and\nbegan to brush off his robes; and then, realising what he was\ndoing, stopped the nervous motions. He'd just defeated Voldemort,\ndamn it, he ought not to be this nervous.",
      "The young witch's head and chestnut curls appeared in the\nopening and peered around. Then she rose up higher, seemed almost\nto run up the ladder steps, like she was walking along an ordinary\nsidewalk but vertically; Harry could have blinked and missed it,\nhow her one shoe came down on the top rung of the ladder and then\nshe leaped lightly onto the roof an instant later.",
      "Hermione. Harry's lips moved around the word, but made\nno sound.",
      "There'd been something Harry had meant to say, but it had gone\nright out of his mind.",
      "Maybe a quarter of the minute passed, on the rooftop, before\nHermione Granger spoke. She was wearing a blue-edged uniform now,\nand the blue-bronze-striped tie of her proper House.",
      "\"Harry,\" said Hermione Granger, a terribly familiar voice that\nalmost brought tears to Harry's eyes, \"before I ask you all the\nquestions, I'd like to start by saying thank you very much for, um,\nwhatever it is you did. I mean it, really. Thank you.\"",
      "\"Hermione,\" Harry said, and swallowed. The phrase may I have\npermission to hug you, which Harry had imagined using for his\nopening line, seemed impossible to say. \"Welcome back. Hold on\nwhile I put up some privacy spells.\" Harry took the Elder Wand out\nof his robes, got a book from his pouch that he opened to a\nbookmark, and then carefully pronounced \"Homenum Revelio,\"\nalong with two other recently-acquired security Charms that Harry\nhad found himself barely able to cast if he wielded the Elder Wand.\nIt wasn't much, but it was marginally better security than just\nrelying on Professor Vector.",
      "\"You have Dumbledore's wand,\" Hermione said. Her voice was\nhushed, and sounded as loud as an avalanche in the still dawn air.\n\"And you can use it to cast fourth-year spells?\"",
      "Harry nodded, making a mental note to be more careful who else\nsaw him do that. \"Is it okay if I hug you?\"",
      "Hermione moved lightly over to him; her movements were\npeculiarly swift, more graceful than they'd been before. Her\nmotions seemed to radiate an air of something pure and untouched,\nreminding Harry again of how peaceful Hermione had looked when she\nwas sleeping on Voldemort's altar -",
      "Realization hit Harry like a ton of bricks, or at least a\nkilogram of brick.",
      "And Harry hugged Hermione, feeling how very alive she\nseemed. He felt like crying, and suppressed it, because he didn't\nknow whether that was just her aura affecting him or not.",
      "Hermione's arms around him were gentle, exceedingly light in\ntheir pressure, as if she were being deliberately careful not to\nsnap his body in half like a used toothpick.",
      "\"So,\" Hermione said, once Harry had let go of her. Her young\nface looked very serious, as well as pure and innocent. \"I didn't\ntell the Aurors you were there, or that it was Professor Quirrell\nand not You-Know-Who who killed all the Death Eaters. Professor\nFlitwick only let them give me one drop of Veritaserum, so I didn't\nhave to say. I just told them the troll was the last thing I\nremembered.\"",
      "\"Ah,\" Harry said. He had somehow found himself staring at\nHermione's nose instead of her eyes. \"What do you think happened,\nexactly?\"",
      "\"Well,\" Hermione Granger said consideringly, \"I got eaten by a\ntroll, which I'd frankly rather not do again, and then there was a\nreally loud bang and my legs were back, and I was lying on\na stone altar in the middle of a graveyard in a dark moonlit forest\nI'd never seen before, with somebody's severed hands clutched\naround my throat. So you see, Mr. Potter, finding myself in a\nsituation that weird and dark and scary, I wasn't going to make the\nsame mistake I did last time with Tracey. I knew right\naway that it was you.\"",
      "Harry nodded. \"Good call.\"",
      "\"I said your name, but you didn't answer,\" said Hermione. \"I sat\nup and one of the bloody hands slid down over my shirt, leaving\nlittle bits of flesh behind. I didn't scream though, even when I\nlooked around and saw all the heads and bodies and realized what\nthe smell was.\" Hermione stopped, took another deep breath. \"I saw\nthe skull masks and realized that the dead people had been Death\nEaters. I knew right away that the Defense Professor had been there\nwith you and killed them all, but I didn't notice Professor\nQuirrell's body was also there. I didn't realize it was him even\nwhen I saw Professor Flitwick checking the body. He looked...\ndifferent, when he was dead.\" Hermione's voice became quieter. She\nlooked humbled somehow, in a way Harry couldn't often remember\nseeing. \"They said David Monroe sacrificed his life to bring me\nback, the same way your mother sacrificed herself for you, so that\nthe Dark Lord would explode again when he tried to touch me. I'm\npretty sure that's not the whole truth, but... I've\nthought a lot of nasty things about our Defense Professor that I\nnever should've thought.\"",
      "\"Um,\" Harry said.",
      "Hermione nodded solemnly, her hands clasped in front of her as\nthough in penitence. \"I know you're probably too nice to say the\nthings to me that you have a right to say now, so I'll say them for\nyou, Harry. You were right about Professor Quirrell, and I was\nwrong. You told me so. David Monroe was a little bit Dark and a\nwhole lot Slytherin, and it was childish of me to think that was\nthe same thing as being evil.\"",
      "\"Ah...\" Harry said. This was very hard to say. \"Actually, the\nrest of the world doesn't know this part, not even the\nHeadmistress. But in point of fact you were one hundred and twelve\npercent correct about him being evil, and I'll remember for future\nreference that although 'Dark' and 'evil' may not technically be\nthe same thing, there's a great big statistical correlation.\"",
      "\"Oh,\" said Hermione, and fell silent again.",
      "\"You're not saying that you told me so?\" said Harry. His mental\nmodel of Hermione was yelling: I TOLD YOU SO! DIDN'T I TELL YOU SO,\nMR. POTTER? DIDN'T I TELL YOU? PROFESSOR QUIRRELL IS EEEEVIIIL, I\nSAID, BUT YOU DIDN'T LISTEN TO ME!",
      "The actual Hermione just shook her head. \"I know you cared about\nhim a lot,\" she said softly. \"Since I was right after all... I knew\nyou'd probably be hurting a lot after Professor Quirrell turned out\nto be evil, and that it wouldn't be a good time to say I told you\nso. I mean, that's what I decided when I was thinking that part\nthrough several months earlier.\"",
      "Thank you, Miss Granger. Harry was glad she'd said that\nmuch, though, it just wouldn't have felt like Hermione\notherwise.",
      "\"So, Mr. Potter,\" said Hermione Granger, tapping her fingers on\nher robe at around thigh level. \"After the medi-witch drew my\nblood, it stopped hurting right away, and when I brushed away the\nlittle bit of blood on my arm, I couldn't find where the needle had\npoked me. I bent some of the metal in my bedframe without trying\nhard, and though I haven't had a chance to test it yet, I feel like\nI should be able to run really fast. My fingernails are\npearly-white and shiny even though I don't remember painting them.\nAnd my teeth look like that too, which, being the daughter of\ndentists, makes me nervous. So it's not that I'm ungrateful, but\njust what exactly did you do?\"",
      "\"Um,\" Harry said. \"And I'm expecting you're also wondering why\nyou're radiating an aura of purity and innocence?\"",
      "\"I'm WHAT?\"",
      "\"That part wasn't my idea. Honestly.\" Harry's voice went small.\n\"Please don't kill me.\"",
      "Hermione Granger raised her hands in front of her face, staring\nsomewhat cross-eyed at her fingers. \"Harry, are you saying... I\nmean, my radiating innocence and being all fast and graceful and my\nteeth being pearly white... is it alicorn my fingernails\nare made of?\"",
      "\"Alicorn?\"",
      "\"It's the term for unicorn horn, Mr. Potter.\" Hermione Granger\nseemed to be trying to nibble her fingernails, and not having much\nluck. \"So, I guess if you bring a girl back from the dead she ends\nup as, what did Daphne call it, a Sparkling Unicorn Princess?\"",
      "\"That's not exactly what happened,\" Harry said, though it was\nfrighteningly close.",
      "Hermione took her finger out of her mouth, frowning at it. \"I\ncan't bite through it either. Mr. Potter, did you consider the\nproblems now that it's literally impossible for me to trim my\nfingernails and toenails?\"",
      "\"The Weasley twins have a magical sword that should work,\" Harry\nvolunteered.",
      "\"I think,\" Hermione Granger said firmly, \"that I would like to\nknow the whole story behind all this, Mr. Potter. Because knowing\nyou and knowing Professor Quirrell, there was some sort of\nplan going on.\"",
      "Harry took a deep breath. Then he exhaled. \"Sorry, it's...\nclassified. I could tell you if you studied Occlumency, but... do\nyou want to?\"",
      "\"Do I want to study Occlumency?\" Hermione said, looking slightly\nsurprised. \"That's at least a sixth-year thing, isn't it?\"",
      "\"I learned it,\" Harry said. \"I started with an unusual boost,\nbut I doubt that really mattered in the long run. I mean, I'm sure\nyou could learn calculus if you studied hard, regardless of what\nage Muggles usually learn it. The question is, um.\" Harry was\nhaving to control his breathing. \"The question is, do you still\nwant to do... that kind of stuff.\"",
      "Hermione turned, and looked at where the sky was lightening in\nthe east. \"You mean,\" she said quietly, \"do I still want to be a\nhero now that it's earned me a horrible death that one time.\"",
      "Harry nodded, then said \"Yes\" because Hermione wasn't turning\ntoward him, though the word felt blocked in his throat.",
      "\"I've been thinking about that,\" Hermione said. \"It was, in\nfact, an exceptionally gruesome and painful death.\"",
      "\"I, um. I did set some things up just in case\nyou still wanted to be a hero. There were some short windows of\nopportunity where I didn't have time to consult you, I couldn't let\nyou see me because I expected you to be given Veritaserum later.\nBut if you don't like it, I can undo most of what I did and you can\njust ignore the rest.\"",
      "Hermione nodded distantly. \"Like making everyone think that I...\nHarry, did I actually do anything to You-Know-Who?\"",
      "\"No, that was all me, though please don't tell anyone that. Just\nso you know, that time the Boy-Who-Lived supposedly defeated\nVoldemort, on the night of Halloween in 1981, that was Dumbledore's\nvictory and he let everyone think it was me. So now I've defeated a\nDark Lord once, and gotten credit for it once. It all balances out\neventually, I guess.\"",
      "Hermione went on gazing to the east. \"I'm not really comfortable\nwith this,\" she said after a while. \"People thinking I defeated the\nDark Lord Voldemort, when I haven't done anything at all... oh,\nthat's the same thing you went through, isn't it?\"",
      "\"Yeah. Sorry about inflicting that on you. I was... well, I was\ntrying to create a separate identity for you in people's minds, I\nguess. There was just the one opportunity and everything was sort\nof rushed and... I realized afterwards that maybe I\nshouldn't have, but it was too late.\" Harry cleared his throat.\n\"Though, um. If you're feeling like you want to do something that's\nactually worthy of the way people think about the Girl-Who-Revived,\num. I might have an idea for what you can do. Very soon, if you\nwant.\"",
      "Hermione Granger was giving him a look.",
      "\"But you don't have to!\" Harry said hastily. \"You can\njust ignore this whole thing and be the best student in Ravenclaw!\nIf that's what you prefer.\"",
      "\"Are you trying to use reverse psychology on me, Mr.\nPotter?\"",
      "\"No! Honestly!\" Harry took a deep breath. \"I'm trying\nnot to decide your life for you. I thought I saw, yesterday, I\nthought I saw what might come next for you - but then I remembered\nhow much of this year I'd spent being a total idiot. I thought of\nsome things Dumbledore said to me. I realized it genuinely wasn't\nmy place to say. That you could do anything you wanted with your\nlife, and that above all, the choice had to be your own. Maybe you\ndon't want to be a hero after this, maybe you want to\nbecome a great magical researcher because that's who Hermione\nGranger really was all along, never mind what your fingernails are\nmade out of now. Or you could go to the Salem Witches' Institute in\nAmerica instead of Hogwarts. I won't lie and say I'd like that, but\nit really is up to you.\" Harry turned to the horizon and swept his\nhand wide, as though to indicate all the world that lay beyond\nHogwarts. \"You can go anywhere from here. You can do\nanything with your life. If you want to be a wealthy\nsixty-year-old merman, I can make it happen. I'm serious.\"",
      "Hermione nodded slowly. \"I'm curious about how you'd do that\nexactly, but what I want isn't to have things done for\nme.\"",
      "Harry sighed. \"I understand. Um...\" Harry hesitated. \"I think...\nif it helps you to know... in my case, things were being arranged\nfor me a lot. By Dumbledore, mostly, though Professor\nQuirrell too. Maybe the power to earn your own way in life is\nitself something you have to earn.\"",
      "\"Why, that sounds very wise,\" Hermione said. \"Like having my\nparents pay for me to go to university, so I can someday get my own\njob. Professor Quirrell bringing me back to life as a Sparkling\nUnicorn Princess and you telling everyone that I offed the Dark\nLord Voldemort is just like that, really.\"",
      "\"I am sorry,\" Harry said. \"I know I should've done it\ndifferently, but... I didn't have much time to plan and I was\nexhausted and not really thinking straight -\"",
      "\"I'm grateful, Harry,\" Hermione said, her voice softer now.\n\"You're being too harsh on yourself, even. Please don't take it so\nseriously when I'm snarky at you. I don't want to be the sort of\ngirl who comes back from the dead, and then starts complaining\nabout which superpowers she got and that her alicorn fingernails\nare the wrong shade of pearly white.\" Hermione had turned, was\nagain gazing off at the east. \"But, Mr. Potter... if I do\ndecide that dying a horrible death isn't enough to make me rethink\nmy life choices... not that I'm saying that just yet... then what\nhappens next?\"",
      "\"I do my best to support you in your life choices,\" Harry said\nfirmly. \"Whatever they are.\"",
      "\"You have a quest already lined up for me, I'm guessing. A nice\nsafe quest where there's no chance of my getting hurt again.\"",
      "Harry rubbed his eyes, feeling tired inside. It was like he\ncould hear the voice of Albus Dumbledore inside his head.\nForgive me, Hermione Granger... \"I'm sorry, Hermione. If\nyou go down that path I'm going to have to Dumbledore you, and not\ntell you some things. Manipulate you, if only for a short while. I\ndo believe there's something you might be able to do now, something\nreal, something worthy of the way people are thinking about the\nGirl-Who-Revived... that you might have a destiny, even... but in\nthe end that's just a guess, I know a lot less than Dumbledore did.\nAre you willing to risk the life you just got back?\"",
      "Hermione turned to look at him, her eyes widening in surprise.\n\"Risk my life?\u202f\"",
      "Harry didn't nod, because that would have been outright lying.\n\"Are you willing to do that?\" Harry said instead. \"The quest that I\nthink might be your destiny - and no, I don't know any specific\nprophecies, it's just a guess - involves literal descent-into-Hell\ntype stuff.\"",
      "\"I thought...\" Hermione said. She sounded uncertain. \"I thought\nfor sure that after this, you and Professor McGonagall wouldn't...\nyou know... let me do anything the least bit dangerous ever\nagain.\"",
      "Harry said nothing, feeling guilty about the false relationship\ncredit he was getting. It was in fact the case that Hermione was\nmodeling him with tremendous accuracy, and that if not for Hermione\nhaving a horcrux, the surface of the planet Venus would have\ndropped to fractional-Kelvin temperatures before Harry tried\nthis.",
      "\"On a scale of zero to a hundred, how literal a descent\ninto Hell are we talking about here?\" said Hermione. The girl now\nlooked a bit worried.",
      "Harry mentally calibrated his scales, remembering Azkaban. \"I'd\nsay maybe eighty-seven?\"",
      "\"This sounds like something I should do when I'm older,\nHarry. There's a difference between being a hero and being a\ncomplete lunatic.\"",
      "Harry shook his head. \"I don't think the risk would change\nmuch,\" Harry said, leaving aside the question of how much risk that\nreally was, \"and it's the sort of thing that's better done sooner,\nif someone does it at all.\"",
      "\"And my parents don't get a vote,\" Hermione said. \"Or do\nthey?\"",
      "Harry shrugged. \"We both know how they'd vote, and you can take\nthat into account if you like. Um, I said for Dr. and Dr. Granger\nnot to be told yet that you're alive. They'll find out after you\ncome back from your mission, if you choose to accept it. That seems\na bit... kinder on your parents' nerves, they just get the one\npleasant surprise, instead of having to worry about, um,\nstuff.\"",
      "\"Why, that's very thoughtful of you,\" Hermione said. \"It's nice\nthat you're so concerned about their feelings. May I think about\nthis for a few minutes, please?\"",
      "Harry gestured toward the cushion he'd set down opposite his\nown, and Hermione moved over with fluid grace, and sat down to look\nout over the castle-edge, still radiating peacefulness all over the\nplace. They'd really need to do something about that, maybe pay\nsomeone to invent an Anti-Purity Potion.",
      "\"Do I have to decide without knowing what the mission is?\"\nHermione asked.",
      "\"Oh hell no,\" Harry said, thinking of a similar\nconversation before his own trip to Azkaban. \"This is the sort of\nthing you have to choose freely if you do it at all. I mean that's\nan actual mission requirement. If you say that you still want to be\na hero, I'll tell you afterwards about the mission - after you've\nhad some time to eat and talk to people and recover a bit - and\nyou'll decide then if it's something you want to do. And we'll test\nin advance whether returning from death has allowed you to cast the\nspell that normal wizards think is impossible, before you\ngo out.\"",
      "Hermione nodded, and fell back into silence.",
      "The sky had lightened further by the time Hermione spoke\nagain.",
      "\"I'm afraid,\" Hermione said, almost in a whisper. \"Not of dying\nagain, or not just that. I'm afraid I won't be good\nenough. I had my chance to defeat a troll, and instead I just died\n-\"",
      "\"That was a troll empowered by Voldemort as a weapon, plus he\nsabotaged all your magic items, just so you know.\"",
      "\"I died. And you killed the troll, somehow, I think I remember\nthat part, it didn't even slow you down.\" Hermione wasn't crying,\nno tears glistened on her cheeks, she simply gazed off at the\nlightening sky where the Sun would rise. \"And then you brought me\nback from the dead as a Sparkling Unicorn Princess. I know\nI couldn't have done that. I'm afraid I'll never be able\nto do that, no matter what people think about me.\"",
      "\"This situation is where your journey begins, I think -\" Harry\npaused. \"Excuse me, I shouldn't be trying to influence your\ndecision.\"",
      "\"No,\" Hermione whispered, still gazing at the hills below her.\nShe raised her voice. \"No, Harry, I want to hear this.\"",
      "\"Okay. Um. I think this is where you start. Everything\nthat's happened up until now... it places you in the same place I\nstarted out in September, when I'd thought of myself as just being\na child prodigy before, and then I found something new I needed to\nlive up to. If you weren't comparing yourself to me and my,\"\nadult cognitive patterns copied off Tom Riddle, \"dark\nside... then you'd be the brightest star of Ravenclaw, who\norganized her own company to fight school bullies and kept her\nsanity under assault by Voldemort, all while she was only twelve\nyears old. I looked it up, you got better grades than Dumbledore\ndid in his first year.\" Leaving aside the Defense\ngrade, because that was just Voldemort being Voldemort. \"Now\nyou have some powers, and a reputation to live up to, and the world\nis about to hand you some difficult tasks. That's where it all\nbegins for you, the same as it began for me. Don't sell\nyourself short.\" And then Harry shut his mouth hard, because he was\ntalking Hermione into it and that wasn't right. He'd at\nleast managed to stop before the part where he asked, if\nshe couldn't be a hero with all that going for her, who\nexactly she thought was going to do it.",
      "\"You know,\" Hermione said to the horizon, still not looking at\nHarry, \"I had a conversation like this with Professor Quirrell,\nonce, about being a hero. He was taking the other side, of course.\nBut apart from that, this is feeling like when he argued with me,\nsomehow.\"",
      "Harry kept his lips pressed shut. Letting people make their own\ndecisions was hard, because it meant they were allowed to make the\nwrong ones, but it still had to be done.",
      "Hermione spoke carefully, the blue fringes of her Hogwarts\nuniform now seeming brighter against her black robes as the sky all\naround them became illuminated; there were no more stars in the\nwest. \"Professor Quirrell told me, he said he'd been a hero once.\nBut people weren't helping him enough, so he gave up and went off\nto do something more interesting. I told Professor Quirrell that it\nhadn't been right for him to do that - what I actually said was\n'that's horrible'. Professor Quirrell said that, yes, maybe he was\nan awful person, but then what about all the other people who'd\nnever tried to be heroes at all? Were they even worse than him? And\nI didn't know what to say back. I mean, it's wrong to say that only\nGryffindor-style heroes are good people - though I think from\nProfessor Quirrell's perspective it was more like only people with\nbig ambitions had a right to breathe. And I didn't believe that.\nBut it also seemed wrong to stop being a hero, to walk\naway like he'd done. So I just stood there looking silly. But now I\nknow what I should've told him back then.\"",
      "Harry controlled his breathing.",
      "Hermione stood up from her cushion, and turned to face Harry.\n\"I'm done with trying to be a heroine,\" said Hermione Granger with\nthe eastern sky brightening around her. \"I shouldn't ever have gone\nalong with that entire line of thinking. There are just people who\ndo what they can, whatever they can. And there are also people who\ndon't even try to do what they can, and yes, those people are doing\nsomething wrong. I'm not ever going to try to be a hero again. I'm\nnot going to think in heroic terms if I can help it. But I\nwon't do any less than I can - or not a lot less, I mean, I'm only\nhuman.\" Harry had never understood what was supposed to be\nmysterious about the Mona Lisa, but if he could have taken a\npicture of Hermione's resigned/joyous smile just then, he had the\nsense that he could have looked at it for hours without\nunderstanding, and that Dumbledore could have read through it at a\nglance. \"I won't learn my lesson. I will be that stupid.\nI'll go on trying to do most of what I can, or at least\nsome of what I can - oh, you know what I mean. Even if it\nmeans risking my life again, so long as it's worth the risk and\nisn't being, you know, actually stupid. That's my answer.\"\nHermione took a deep breath, her face resolute. \"So, is there\nsomething I can do?\"",
      "Harry's throat was choked. He reached into his pouch, and signed\nC-L-O-A-K since he couldn't speak, and drew forth the fuliginous\nspill of the Cloak of Invisibility, offering it to Hermione for the\nlast time. Harry had to force the words from his throat. \"This is\nthe True Cloak of Invisibility,\" Harry said in almost a whisper,\n\"the Deathly Hallow passed down from Ignotus Peverell to his heirs,\nthe Potters. And now to you -\"",
      "\"Harry!\" Hermione said. Her hands flew up across her chest, as\nthough to protect herself from the attacking gift. \"You don't have\nto do this!\"",
      "\"I do have to do this. I've left the part of the path\nthat lets me be a hero, I can't risk myself adventuring, ever. And\nyou... can.\" Harry reached up the hand that wasn't holding the\nCloak, and wiped at his eyes. \"This was made for you, I think. For\nthe person you're going to become.\" A weapon to fight Death, in\nits form as the shadow of despair that falls on human minds and\ndrains away their hope for the future; you will fight that, I\nexpect, in more forms than just Dementors... \"I do not loan\nyou, my Cloak, but give you, unto Hermione Jean Granger. Protect\nher well forevermore.\"",
      "Slowly, Hermione reached out, and took hold of the Cloak,\nlooking like she was trying not to cry herself. \"Thank you,\" she\nwhispered. \"I think... even though I'm done with the notion of\nheroing... I think that you always were, from the day I met you, my\nmysterious old wizard.\"",
      "\"And I think,\" Harry said, his own throat half-closed, \"even if\nyou deny that way of thinking now, I think that you were always\ndestined to become, from the very beginning of the story, the\nhero.\" Who must Hermione Granger become, what adult form must\nshe take when she grows up, to pass through Time's narrow keyhole?\nI don't know the answer to that either, any more than I can imagine\nmy own adult self. But her next few steps ahead seem clearer than\nmine...",
      "Harry let the Cloak go, and it passed from his hands to\nhers.",
      "\"It sings,\" Hermione said. \"It's singing to me.\" She reached up,\nand wiped at her own eyes. \"I can't believe you did that,\nHarry.\"",
      "Harry's other hand came out of his pouch, now bearing a long\ngolden chain, at the end of which dangled a closed golden shell.\n\"And this is your personal time machine.\"",
      "There was a pause, during which the planet Earth rotated a bit\nfurther in its orbit.",
      "\"What?\" said Hermione.",
      "\"A Time-Turner, they call it. Hogwarts has a stock they give out\nto some students, I got one at the start of the year to treat my\nsleep disorder. It lets the user go backwards in time, in up to six\none-hour increments, which I used to get six extra hours per day to\nstudy. And to vanish out of Potions class and so on. Don't worry, a\nTime-Turner can't change history or generate paradoxes that destroy\nthe universe.\"",
      "\"You were keeping up with me in lessons by studying six extra\nhours per day using a time machine.\" Hermione Granger\nseemed to be having trouble with this concept for some\nunaccountable reason.",
      "Harry made his face look puzzled. \"Is there something odd about\nthat?\"",
      "Hermione reached out and took the golden necklace. \"I guess\nnot by wizard standards,\" she said. For some reason her\nvoice sounded rather sharp. She arranged the chain around her neck,\nplacing the hourglass inside her shirt. \"I do feel better now about\nkeeping up with you, though, so thank you for that.\"",
      "Harry cleared his throat. \"Also, since Voldemort wiped out the\nHouse of Monroe and then, so far as everyone believes, you avenged\nthem by killing Voldemort, I got Amelia Bones to railroad a bill\nthrough what's left of the Wizengamot, saying that Granger is now a\nNoble House of Britain.\"",
      "\"Excuse me?\" said Hermione.",
      "\"That also makes you the only scion of a Noble House, which\nmeans that to get your legal majority you just need to pass your\nOrdinary Wizarding Levels, which I've set us up to do at the end of\nthe summer so we'll have some time to study first. If you're okay\nwith that, I mean.\"",
      "Hermione Granger was making some sort of high-pitched noise that\nwould, in a less organic device, have indicated an engine\nmalfunction. \"I have two months to study for my\nO.W.L.S?\"",
      "\"Hermione, it's a test designed so that most fifteen-year-olds\ncan pass. Ordinary fifteen year-olds. We can get a passing\ngrade with a low third-year's power level if we learn the right set\nof spells, and that's all we need for our majorities. Though you'll\nneed to come to terms with getting Acceptable scores instead of\nyour usual Outstandings.\"",
      "The high-pitched noises coming from Hermione Granger rose in\npitch.",
      "\"Here's your wand back.\" Harry took it from his pouch. \"And your\nmokeskin pouch, I made sure they put back everything that was there\nwhen you died.\" That pouch Harry withdrew from a normal pocket of\nhis robes, since he was reluctant to put a bag of holding\ninside a bag of holding no matter what was supposed to be\nharmless so long as both devices had been crafted observing all\nsafety precautions.",
      "Hermione took her wand back, and then her pouch, the motions\nsomehow managing to look graceful even though her fingers were a\nbit shaky.",
      "\"Let's see, what else... the oath you swore before to House\nPotter only said you had to serve until 'the day you die', so\nyou're now free and clear. And right after your death I got the\nMalfoys to publicly declare that you were innocent of all charges\nin Draco's attempted murder.\"",
      "\"Why, thank you again, Harry,\" said Hermione Granger. \"That was\nvery nice of you, and them too, I guess.\" She was repeatedly\nrunning her fingers through her chestnut curls, as though, by\norganizing her hair, she could restore sanity to her life.",
      "\"Last but not least, I had the goblins start the process of\nbuilding a vault in Gringotts for House Granger,\" Harry said. \"I\ndidn't put any money into it, because that was something where I\ncould wait and ask you first. But if you're going to be a superhero\nwho goes around righting certain kinds of wrongs, it will help a\nlot if people consider you to be part of the upper social strata\nand, um, I think it may help if they know you can afford lawyers. I\ncan put in as much gold into your vault as you want, since after\nVoldemort killed Nicholas Flamel, I ended up holding the\nPhilosopher's Stone.\"",
      "\"I feel like I ought to be fainting,\" Hermione said in a\nhigh-pitched voice, \"only I can't because of my superpowers and\nwhy do I have those again?\"",
      "\"If it's all right with you, your Occlumency lessons will start\non Wednesday with Mr. Bester, he can work with you once per day.\nUntil then, I think it might be better for the true origin of your\npowers not to become known just because a Legilimens looks you in\nthe eyes. I mean, obviously there's a normal magical explanation,\nnothing super-supernatural, but people do tend to worship\ntheir own ignorance and, well, I think the Girl-Who-Revived will be\nmore effective if you remain mysterious. Once you can keep out Mr.\nBester and beat Veritaserum, I'll tell you the entire backstory, I\npromise, including all the secrets you can never tell anyone\nelse.\"",
      "\"That sounds lovely,\" said Hermione Granger. \"I'm quite looking\nforward to it.\"",
      "\"Though you'll need to take an Unbreakable Vow to not do\nanything that might destroy the world before I can tell you the\nmore dangerous parts of the story. I mean, I literally can't tell\nyou otherwise, because I took an Unbreakable Vow myself. Is that\nokay?\"",
      "\"Sure,\" said Hermione. \"Why shouldn't it be okay? I wouldn't\nwant to destroy the world anyhow.\"",
      "\"Do you need to sit down again?\" Harry said, feeling alarmed by\nthe way Hermione was swaying slightly, as though in rhythm with the\nwords being spoken.",
      "Hermione Granger took several deep breaths. \"No, I'm perfectly\npeachy,\" she said. \"Is there anything else I should know\nabout?\"",
      "\"That was it. I'm finished, at least for now.\" Harry paused. \"I\ndo understand that you want to do things for yourself, not just\nhave them done for you. It's just... you're going to be a more\nserious kind of hero, and the only sane choice is for me to give\nyou all the advantages I can manage -\"",
      "\"I understand that quite well,\" Hermione said. \"Now that I've\nactually lost a fight and died. I didn't used to understand, but\nnow I do.\" A breeze ruffled Hermione's chestnut hair and stirred\nher robes, making her look even more peaceful in the dawn air, as\nshe raised one hand and carefully clenched it into a fist. \"If I'm\ngoing to do this, I'm going to do it right. We need to\nmeasure how hard I can punch, and how high I can jump, and figure\nout a safe way to test if my fingernails can kill Lethifolds like a\nreal unicorn's horn, and I should practice using my speed to dodge\nspells I can't let hit me and... and it sounds like you could maybe\narrange for me to get Auror training, like from whoever taught\nSusan Bones.\" Hermione was smiling again now, a strange light in\nher eyes that would've puzzled Dumbledore for hours and that Harry\nunderstood immediately, not without a twinge of apprehension. \"Oh!\nAnd I want to start carrying Muggle weapons, maybe hidden so nobody\nknows I have them. I thought of incendiary grenades when I was\nfighting the troll, but I knew I couldn't Transfigure them fast\nenough, even after I stopped caring about obeying the rules.\"",
      "\"I have the feeling,\" Harry said, imitating Professor\nMcGonagall's Scottish accent as best he could, \"that I ought to be\ndoing something about this.\"",
      "\"Oh, it's much, much, MUCH too late for that, Mr. Potter. Say,\ncan you get me a bazooka? The rocket launcher, I mean, not the\nchewing gum? I bet they won't be expecting that from a\nyoung girl, especially if I'm radiating an aura of innocence and\npurity.\"",
      "\"All right,\" Harry said calmly, \"now you're starting to\nscare me.\"",
      "Hermione paused from where she was experimenting with balancing\non the tip of her left shoe, her arm reaching in one direction and\nher right leg stretched in the other, like a ballet dancer. \"Am I?\nI was just thinking that I didn't see what I could do that a\nMinistry squad of Hit Wizards couldn't. They have broomsticks for\nmobility and spells that hit harder than I possibly could.\" She\ngracefully lowered her leg back down. \"I mean, now that I can try a\nfew things without worrying about who's watching, I'm starting to\nthink that I really really really like having superpowers.\nBut I still don't see how I could win a fight that Professor\nFlitwick couldn't, not unless it involves me taking a Dark Wizard\nby surprise.\"",
      "You can take risks other people shouldn't, and try again\nwith the knowledge of what killed you. You can experiment with new\nspells, more than anyone else could try without dying for\nsure. But Harry couldn't say any of that yet, so instead he\nsaid, \"I think it's okay to think more about the future, not just\nwhat you can do this very minute.\"",
      "Hermione jumped high in the air, clicked her heels together\nthree times on the way down, and landed on her tiptoes, perfectly\nposed. \"But you said there was something I could do right away. Or\nwere you just testing?\"",
      "\"That part is a special case,\" Harry said, feeling the\nchill of the dawn air against his skin. He was increasingly not\nlooking forward to telling super-Hermione that her Ordeal would\ninvolve facing her literal worst nightmare, under conditions where\nall her newfound physical strength would be useless.",
      "Hermione nodded, then glanced to the east. At once she went to\nthe side of the roof and sat down, her feet dangling over the\nrooftop ledge. Harry went to her side and sat down too, sitting\ncrosslegged and further back of the roof-edge.",
      "In the distance, a brilliant tinge of red was rising above the\nhills to the east of Hogwarts.",
      "Watching the tip of the sunrise made Harry feel better, somehow.\nSo long as the Sun was in the sky, things were still all right on\nsome level, like his having not yet destroyed the Sun.",
      "\"So,\" Hermione said. Her voice rose a bit. \"Speaking of the\nfuture, Harry. I had time to think about a lot of things while I\nwas waiting in St. Mungo's, and... maybe it's silly of me, but\nthere's a question I still want to know the answer to. Do you\nremember the last thing we talked about together? Before, I\nmean?\"",
      "\"What?\" Harry said blankly.",
      "\"Oh...\" Hermione said. \"It was two months ago for you... I guess\nyou don't recall, then.\"",
      "And Harry remembered.",
      "\"Don't panic!\" Hermione said, as a sort of strangled half-gurgle\ncame from Harry's throat. \"I promise no matter what you say, I\nwon't burst into tears and run away and get eaten by a troll again!\nI know it's been less than two days for me, but I think that dying\nhas made a lot of things I used to fret about seem much less\nimportant compared to what I've been through!\"",
      "\"Oh,\" Harry said, his own voice now high-pitched. \"That's a good\nuse of a major trauma, I guess?\"",
      "\"Only, see, I was still wondering about it, Harry,\nbecause for me it hasn't been very long at all since our last\nconversation, and we didn't finish talking which was admittedly all\nmy own fault for losing control of my emotions and then being eaten\nby a troll which I am definitely not going to do again. I've been\nthinking I ought to reassure you that's not going to happen every\ntime you say the wrong thing to a girl.\" Hermione was fidgeting,\nleaning from one side to the other where she sat, slightly back and\nforth. \"But, well, even most people who are in love don't\ndo literally one hundredth of what you've done for me. So, Mr.\nHarry James Potter-Evans-Verres, if it's not love, I want to know\nexactly what I am to you. You never said.\"",
      "\"That's a good question,\" Harry said, controlling the rising\npanic. \"Do you mind if I think about it?\"",
      "Bit by bit, more of the searingly brilliant circle became\nvisible beyond the hills.",
      "\"Hermione,\" Harry said when the Sun was halfway above the\nhorizon, \"did you ever invent any hypotheses to explain my\nmysterious dark side?\"",
      "\"Just the obvious one,\" Hermione said, kicking her legs slightly\nover the rooftop's edge. \"I thought maybe when You-Know-Who died\nright next to you, he happened to give off the burst of magic that\nmakes a ghost, and some of it imprinted on your brain instead of\nthe floor. But that never felt right to me, like it was just a\nclever explanation that wasn't actually true, and it makes\neven less sense if You-Know-Who didn't really die that night.\"",
      "\"Good enough,\" Harry said. \"Let's imagine that scenario for\nnow.\" His inner rationalist was looking back and facepalming\nagain at how he'd managed to not-think-about hypotheses\nlike that one. It wasn't true but it was reasonable and\nHarry had never thought of any causal model that concrete, just\nvaguely suspected a connection.",
      "Hermione nodded. \"You probably know this already, but I just\nthought I'd say it to be sure: You're not Voldemort, Harry.\"",
      "\"I know. And that's what you mean to me.\" Harry took a\nbreath, finding it still painful to say aloud. \"Voldemort... he\nwasn't a happy person. I don't know if he was ever happy, a single\nday in his life.\" He never could cast the Patronus Charm.\n\"That's one reason his cognitive patterns didn't take me over, my\ndark side didn't feel like a good place to be, it didn't get\npositively reinforced. Being friends with you means that my life\ndoesn't have to go the way Voldemort's did. And I was pretty lonely\nbefore Hogwarts, although I didn't realise it then, so... yeah. I\nmight've been slightly more desperate to bring you back from the\ndead than the average boy my age would've been. Though I also\nmaintain that my decision was strictly normative moral reasoning,\nand if other people care less about their friends, that's their\nproblem, not mine.\"",
      "\"I see,\" Hermione said softly. She hesitated. \"Harry, don't take\nthis the wrong way, but I'm not one hundred percent comfortable\nwith that. It's a big responsibility that I didn't choose, and I\ndon't think it's healthy for you to lay it on just one person.\"",
      "Harry nodded. \"I know. But there's more to the point I'm trying\nto make. There was a prophecy about my vanquishing Voldemort -\"",
      "\"A prophecy? There was a prophecy about you?\nSeriously, Harry?\"",
      "\"Yeah, I know. Anyway, part of it went, 'And the Dark Lord shall\nmark him as his equal, but he shall have power the Dark Lord knows\nnot.' What would you guess that meant?\"",
      "\"Hmmm,\" Hermione said. Her fingers tapped thoughtfully on the\nroof's stone. \"Your mysterious dark side is You-Know-Who's mark on\nyou that made you his equal. The power he knew not... was the\nscientific method, right?\"",
      "Harry shook his head. \"That's what I thought too at first - that\nit was going to be Muggle science, or the methods of rationality.\nBut...\" Harry exhaled. The Sun had now fully risen above the hills.\nThis felt embarrassing to say, but he was going to say it anyway.\n\"Professor Snape, who originally heard the prophecy - yes, that's\nalso a thing that happened - Professor Snape said he didn't think\nit could just be science, that the 'power the Dark Lord knows not'\nneeded to be something more alien to Voldemort than just that. Even\nif I think of it in terms of rationality, well, it turns out that\nthe person Voldemort really was,\" why, Professor Quirrell,\nwhy, the thought still stabbing sickness at Harry's heart,\n\"he'd have been able to learn the methods of rationality too, if he\nread the same science papers I did. Except, maybe, for one last\nthing...\" Harry drew a breath. \"At the end of all of it, during my\nfinal showdown with Voldemort, he threatened to put my parents, and\nmy friends, into Azkaban. Unless I came up with interesting secrets\nto tell him, one person saved per secret. But I knew I couldn't\nfind enough secrets to save everyone. And in the moment that I saw\nno way at all left to save everyone... that's when I actually\nstarted thinking. Maybe for the first time in my life, I started\nthinking. I thought faster than Voldemort, even though he was older\nthan me and smarter, because... because I had a reason to\nthink. Voldemort had a drive to be immortal, he strongly\npreferred not to die, but that wasn't a positive desire, it was\nfear, and Voldemort made mistakes because of that fear. I\nthink the power that Voldemort knew not... was that I had something\nto protect.\"",
      "\"Oh, Harry,\" Hermione said gently. She hesitated. \"Is that what\nI am to you, then? The thing that you protect?\"",
      "\"No, I mean, the whole reason I'm telling you this, is that\nVoldemort wasn't threatening to put you in Azkaban. Even\nif he'd taken over the whole world, you'd have been fine. He'd\nalready made a binding promise not to harm you, because of, um,\nbecause of reasons. So in my moment of ultimate crisis, when I\nreached deep down and found the power Voldemort knew not, I did it\nto protect everyone except you.\"",
      "Hermione considered this, a slow smile spreading over her face.\n\"Why, Harry,\" she said. \"That's the least romantic thing I've ever\nheard.\"",
      "\"You're welcome.\"",
      "\"No, really, it does help,\" Hermione said. \"I mean, it\nmakes the whole thing much less stalker-y.\"",
      "\"I know, right?\"",
      "The two of them shared a companionable nod, both of them looking\nmore relaxed now, and watched the sunrise together.",
      "\"I've been thinking,\" Harry said, his own voice going soft,\n\"about the alternate Harry Potter, the person I might have been if\nVoldemort hadn't attacked my parents.\" If Tom Riddle hadn't\ntried to copy himself onto me. \"That other Harry Potter\nwouldn't have been as smart, I guess. He probably wouldn't have\nstudied much Muggle science, even if his mother was a Muggleborn.\nBut that other Harry Potter would've had... the capacity for\nwarmth, that he inherited from James Potter and Lily Evans, he\nwould've cared about other people and tried to save his friends, I\nknow that would have been true, because that's something that Lord\nVoldemort never did, you see...\" Harry's eyes were watering. \"So\nthat part must be, the remnant.\"",
      "The Sun was well above the horizon now, the golden light\nilluminating both of them, casting long shadows off the other side\nof the rooftop platform.",
      "\"I think you're just fine the way you are,\" Hermione said. \"I\nmean, that other Harry Potter might've been a nice boy, maybe, but\nit sounds like I would've had to do all his thinking for him.\"",
      "\"Going by heredity, alter-Harry would have been in Gryffindor\nlike his parents, and the two of you wouldn't have become friends.\nThough James Potter and Lily Evans were the Head Boy and Head Girl\nof Hogwarts back in their day, so he wouldn't have been\nthat bad.\"",
      "\"I can just imagine it,\" Hermione said. \"Harry James Potter,\nSorted into Gryffindor, aspiring Quidditch player -\"",
      "\"No. Just no.\"",
      "\"Remembered by history as the sidekick of Hermione Jean Granger,\nwho'd send out Mr. Potter to get into trouble for her, and then\nsolve the mystery from the library by reading books and using her\nincredible memory.\"",
      "\"You're really enjoying this alternate universe, aren't\nyou.\"",
      "\"Maybe he'd be best mates with Ron Weasley, the\nsmartest boy in Gryffindor, and they'd fight side by side\nin my army in Defense class, and afterwards help each other with\ntheir homework -\"",
      "\"Okay, enough, this is starting to creep me out.\"",
      "\"Sorry,\" Hermione said, though she was still smiling to herself,\nappearing rapt in some private vision.",
      "\"Apology accepted,\" Harry said dryly.",
      "The Sun rose a little further in the sky.",
      "After a while, Hermione spoke. \"Do you suppose we'll\nfall in love with each other later on?\"",
      "\"I don't know any better than you do, Hermione. But why does it\nhave to be about that? Seriously, why does it always have to be\nabout that? Maybe when we're older we'll fall in love, and maybe we\nwon't. Maybe we'll stay in love, and maybe we won't.\" Harry turned\nhis head slightly, the Sun was hot on his cheek and he wasn't\nwearing sunscreen. \"No matter how it goes, we shouldn't try to\nforce our lives into a pattern. I think when people try to\nforce patterns onto this sort of thing, that's when they\nend up unhappy.\"",
      "\"No forced patterns?\" Hermione said. Her eyes had taken on a\nmischievous look. \"That sounds like a more complicated way of\nsaying no rules. Which I guess seems a lot more reasonable\nto me than it would've at the start of this year. If I'm going to\nbe a Sparkling Unicorn Princess and have my own time machine, I\nmight as well give up on rules, I suppose.\"",
      "\"I'm not saying that rules are always bad, especially when they\nactually fit people, instead of them being blindly imitated like\nQuidditch. But weren't you the one who rejected the 'hero' pattern\nin favor of just doing the things she could?\"",
      "\"I suppose so.\" Hermione turned her head again to gaze down at\nthe grounds below Hogwarts, for the Sun was too bright to look at\nnow - though, Harry thought, Hermione's retinas would always heal\nnow, it was safe for her alone to look directly into the light.\n\"You said, Harry, that you thought I was always destined to be the\nhero. I've been considering, and I suspect you're completely wrong.\nIf this had been meant to be, things would've been a lot\neasier all round. Just doing the things you can do - you have to\nmake that happen, you have to choose it, over and over\nagain.\"",
      "\"That might not conflict with your being a destined hero,\" Harry\nsaid, thinking of compatibilist theories of free will, and\nprophecies that he must not look upon in order to fulfill. \"But we\ncan talk about that later.\"",
      "\"You have to choose it,\" Hermione repeated. She pushed herself\nup on her hands, then popped herself backwards and onto the\nrooftop, rising to her feet in a smooth motion. \"Just like I'm\nchoosing to do this.\"",
      "\"No kissing!\" Harry said, scrambling to his feet and preparing\nto dodge; though the realization came to him that the\nGirl-Who-Revived would be much, much faster.",
      "\"I won't try to kiss you again, Mr. Potter. Not until you ask\nme, if you ever do. But there are all these warm feelings bubbling\nup inside me and I feel like I might burst if I don't do\nsomething, though it does now occur to me that it's\nunhealthy if girls don't know any way of expressing gratitude to\nboys besides kissing them.\" Hermione took out her wand and offered\nit crosswise, in the position she'd used to swear her oath of\nfealty to House Potter before the Wizengamot.",
      "\"Oh hell no,\" Harry said. \"Do you realise what it took\nto get you out of that oath last time -\"",
      "\"Don't go jumping to conclusions, you. I wasn't about to swear\nfealty to your House again. You've got to start trusting me to be\nsensible if you're going to be my mysterious young wizard. Now\nplease hold out your wand.\"",
      "Slowly, Harry took out the Elder Wand and crossed it with\nHermione's ten-and-three-quarter-inches of vinewood, forcing down a\nlast worry about her choosing the wrong thing. \"Can you at least\nnot say anything about 'until death takes me', because did I\nmention I have the Philosopher's Stone now? Or anything about 'the\nend of the world and its magic'? I'm a lot more nervous around\nphrases like that than I used to be.\"",
      "Upon a roof floored in square stony tiles, the brilliant morning\nSun blazes down upon two not-really-children-anymore, both in\nblue-fringed black robes, facing each other across crossed wands.\nOne has brown eyes beneath chaotic chestnut curls, and radiates an\naura of strength and beauty that is not magic only; the other has\ngreen eyes under glasses, with messy black hair above a recently\ninflamed scar. Below, a stone tower nobody remembers seeing from\nground level stretches downwards into the broad base of the castle\nHogwarts. Far beneath them are visible the green hills, and the\nlake. In the distance a huge red-and-black line of railcars and an\nengine, appearing tiny from this height, a train neither Muggle nor\nfully magical. The sky is nearly unclouded, but for faint tinges of\norange-white where wisps of moisture reflect the sunlight. A light\nbreeze carries the crisp chill of dawn, and the dampness of\nmorning; but the huge blazing golden globe is now risen high above\nthe horizon, and its incandescence casts warmth on everything it\ntouches.",
      "\"Well, maybe after this you'll be less nervous,\" the hero says\nto her enigmatic wizard. She knows she doesn't know the whole\nstory, but the fragment of truth that she does hold shines bright\nlike sunlight within her, casting warmth on her insides the way the\nSun warms her face. \"I do choose this, now.\"",
      "Upon my life and magic I swear friendship to Harry\nPotter,\nTo help him and trust in him,\nTo stand with him and, um, stand by him,\nAnd sometimes go where he can't go,\n'Till the day that death takes me for real, if it ever does, I\nmean,\nAnd if the world or its magic ends, we'll deal with that\ntogether.",
      "This is the end of Harry Potter\nand the Methods of Rationality.",
