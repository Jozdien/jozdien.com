I sometimes go by the mononym Jozdien.  â€‹I'm very interested in Artificial Intelligence - it'll break an intelligence barrier we've known forever, and what part of that doesn't sound cool?_nI enjoy all genres of fiction when done well, but my favourites are rational fiction and meta/absurd comedy (as well as crack fanfiction, which feels appropriate closed off in brackets)._nInstagram and Email are my most commonly checked platforms, so if you have ideas, want to collaborate, or just think I'd find something interesting (I probably will - err on the side of messaging me), just send me a message with the phrase \"Duncain wants a banana\"."
